bar is so low and yet the Democrats can't seem to jump over it you can't get on one Accord if you genuinely have different Accords you know black voters are targeted relentlessly with disinformation and misinformation do you really think that the white folks in this country no matter what party are actually interested in black power being able to organize at a level where we aren't dependent on them conservatism is is really sexy to a lot of people right it promises you patriarchy it promises you uh money getting rich you see how black grifters or black people um who ride the fence but usually have conservative talking points how we'll see them more in the algorithm we'll see their stuff pushed [Music] more so I was saying how I wanted to convene all y'all to talk about the black vote and about the amount of media coverage that is paid to it while not paid to it right because there's a lot of discussion about black people in terms of trying to hind like hold the election on our shoulders and and make it about us while not actually ever talking about any issues in the black community or what black the black community are talking about a lot and that's also kind of just supposed to this kind of rise in like rightwing commentary and promotion you're seeing on a lot of these blogs and online commentator and people that people are looking to and so yeah I feel like it's been very very difficult and disheartening to have voting conversations or what to do I guess as as commentators and what's happened in this election so I wanted to put that to the floor and Ben Ben had just explained um Ben you go yeah no uh just again I think it's import I think it's purposeful I think the media is leveraging that stress point that they always use with us what are black people going to do or they're they're preemptively blaming it on us like they did in 2016 like they did in 2020 um but they are not going to discuss any of the issues that are pertinent to us and they are going to continue to sew these seeds of of of dissent around whether or not we should even vote right so there's a lot of energy being sold into making sure black folks don't participate this time yeah and what I was saying was like right now if we're looking about the discourse online between our friends our own families the conversations that we're hearing all around what we're what I'm hearing is the same thing that we had um during with like Trump and Hillary right the Lesser they're trying to pull the lesser of two evils right and I'm like no that's not what we're doing here and um if you're if you're looking just at the the presidential campaign if people are fearing that I want also I this is what I I I'm telling them all I'm like okay if that's a hard space for you to focus on are you focusing on locally what are what are are you looking at what's happening in your state you know who who who's going to be the next leader locally for you how does that help you and your community what does that like for you so that's what I'm telling them to kind of focus on and lean into right now because just not voting at all is going to be very detrimental so yeah um I think I agree I think we have to look at local elections I'm one I'm a person who um tries to inform their community on the judges we have to elect uh locally because uh the Judiciary impacts so um so many aspects of Our Lives whether it be whether it be uh divorces custody battles so many things that impacts black people and in order for us to do that we have to have real genuine conversation engaging organizations engaging black people on the ground and I think yeah like uh the social media atmosphere is a toxic one uh and it tends to lend itself easily to uh the presidential election when you always the the battles really in between like two people it's always good versus evil no matter what side you're on and you just have a constant Clashing of uh ideologies and so like what I'm more interested in is like having conversations and robust conversations like these because black people also need to be able to process what has happened these past four years uh and what has been happening in terms of like uh what what they seen from Biden and what they haven't seen from Biden um but yeah just more fruitful conversation where we can honestly like talk about these things instead of like oh I automatically got to vote for Biden automatically got to vote for Trump which is like what I often see yeah I think that probably we should um talk about have have that conversation about what black people are feeling like they didn't see or did see from Biden because the reality is I feel like the reason they they they every election they do this thing where they act like they're suddenly the rise of the black male Republican right like that's that that's what they're doing they always do it meanwhile black people vote in the 90s something per both for black women and men vote Democrat it but the reason whether or not you know and maybe that is something we should talk about but our social conservatism that is prevalent among black people is still doesn't outweigh the racism of the Republican party and why black people still are not going to vote Republican so to me I think it it's a more worthwhile conversation to instead of to pretend like to me like the black male Republican is a real threat to us it's that we need to talk about why people are so dissatisfied about Joe Biden or why we think there's um voter apathy whether we think that's fair unfair or contributing to can I jump in on that because I think that um one of the things that's missing from the conversation about black voters and black voter apathy or black voter sentiments is the fact that black voters are targeted relentlessly with disinformation and misinformation this goes all the way back to 2016 even the Muller report talked about how Russian bot Farms have been targeting black people and they don't necessarily Target black people specifically on policy issues they target black people within things like saying um uh Planned Parenthood is eugenics or you know Hillary stole money from Haiti or whatever the situation may be they really use racism as a wedge to make black voters disaffected and then when we talk about what the conversation about immigration that's a conversation that simultaneously galvanizes the Republican base but suppresses the black voter base because it it it feeds into that narrative that you know people are getting something and black people are not getting it and so the reason why it's so hard for Democrats to make the kinds of gains that they should be getting or to hold on to the ground that they have is because they're losing not just the disinformation information War but the actual information war and it's not just a messaging thing that's just what reality is according to the information that people are receiving yeah I mean I think that again that's that's a th% true there's there's not been a real investment from the Democratic party in informing black voters whatsoever right because expectation it's you know it's it's it's a funny thing because it's like you damned if you do damned if you don't you know black voters like you said um overwhelmingly support the Democratic party right and yet there's still this narrative especially when it comes to black men like oh black men are turning conservative so on and so forth and we don't have those same conversations about like rightful conversations about uh the Hispanic Community uh about the Asian Community about white women so on and so forth right but it's all placed on uh black men and you know then you expect us to come out vote for you while blaming us when you don't win and you know when you have people in like the Mana sphere and stuff like that who are telling you oh this divest from uh the Democratic party it's hard for like people like us to then say oh no we shouldn't divest from the Democratic party like well they're blaming us for everything they also not invested in Community Information wise so it is difficult because it's like you want us to do what you want us to do for you but you also have no interest whatsoever in combating what actually ends up being a real narrative that you're not invested in us right like it's it's not it's not it's not faux rhetoric it's like real talk yeah and and we're outnumbered that's something I'm thinking about all the time is like PE and people don't realize that it doesn't just come in the form of you the way you said they're not just targeting with directly like oh vote Donald Trump or this is the next thing it's being weeded in through all this Manis all this kind of content the fact that like when you look and you see the pictures of the White House with like kamla and Joe with like the shade room people Jason Lee and those people and blah blah blah and then you think and you go look at what those platforms pose those are actually really conservative platforms that pose nothing but misinformation and spew and and and what that people don't realize is when you spent all year you know spewing misinformation to people and feeding them this kind of like bigotry and this like right-wing Dogma even though you're not telling them the shade room is not saying vote Donald Trump and saying all this throughout the year by the time when you've done given them all force fed them all this conservatism then you're shocked by election season when they actually when they hear all the Donald Trumps and they're like H that's funny that's so d d d and they feel you know and then what do we do when they for so many different reasons like beyond the fact that the right people don't realize I think people often talk about from the left we'll talk about Republicans like they they're just good at winning like overnight but they played a long game right these are people who had Tes and money placed and they work on stuff for 50 years Republicans didn't stop let they didn't let up on road they were on that the whole time right and so they not only have this entire large infrastructure and they have the money there but then you combine that with the algorithms and just like the kind of Rage bait um engagement culture we have now we're outnumbered I feel like how do we how do we counteract that the Manos feres and then if all of our like people are not going to us for the news the way they're going unfortunately they're going to the shade room and they're going to these Outlets and so what do we do you you keep saying shade room and I keep you going to make me start calling all of them Hollywood unlocked uh baller alert uh just go down the list all of them spiritual every one of them here's the thing though I'm going to go even further I don't speak for nobody else on the screen I think they're getting paid for this I think that there is an there is a list that they get talking points from because you're going to see these talking points come out on the same day at at the same time remember they recycled Donald Trump's Platinum plan about two or 3 months ago and then all of a sudden I think it was who was waca Flaka or while one of them shared it and then a whole list of black Negro rappers started sharing it like we know y'all haven't paid attention this much to simultaneously share this Platinum plan but that just lets you know a little bit of money goes such a long way and I got this sound bad but in the Negro Community they're giving these people chump change and they're spreading million dollar propaganda that's impacting the black community in a way that we haven't really been able to measure yet can I say even if they aren't necessarily getting direct payment from some entity that is giving them talking points the algorithm rewards that kind of content so they're getting paid regardless because they're going to get people that are like I can't believe y'all posting this and they gonna get people like yeah Donald Trump 2024 you know and so either way there is a huge profit motive behind it even if it's just simply posting it and saying uh y'all debate you know what do you think about this it's a in the grifters we we see how black grifters or black people um who ride the fence but usually have conservative talking points how we'll see them more in the algorithm we'll see their stuff pushed more and then then we see them just go all out you know Donald Trump is a better pick because and then the rappers that come out the random rappers for why I don't know sexy red was asked about Donald Trump I can take it back to this is a few months ago right and she was asked about Donald Trump and the shade room made sure not to post that um and and then we just saw that she was pregnant but it was a very problematic interview where they're just like you know who do you think is going to win um and because her her her base is like children but children I say children but young folks who can vote right and so she's saying well Donald Trump ain't got no problem with me he's just funny people just don't understand him he put money in my pocket ain't no other president did that he put money and these people are saying that's true he put money in my pocket and as we discussed been um on our show like it or not that $600 check that we we it was literally scraps and and he he held it just so he can sign it and have a signature on it you guys were nothing to him about that and we fought for more and he gave you the $600 and so that's not him putting money in your pocket it's the people who worked hard for him to even give you a dollar during that time on top of that he sees you so little that he goes to speak in front of a black conservative crowd allegedly and then he's literally selling off a sneaker he's selling you off his criminal record and he's just talking about the black faces that he sees in the audience is this that's all literally that's it that's that's how low the bar is for black people but but the thing about it is that that makes me so frustrated the bar is so low and yet the Democrats can't seem to jump over it right come on somebody because the reality of it is is that like you know all of us um I don't know everybody on here but I do know for us to be here we have a certain level of privilege right this is you know we're pontificating on black politics right but I but I'm from the projects I'm you know and most of my family still in the projects everybody got two three jobs so on and so forth and when I'm going and talking to people from where I'm from so and whatever about politics they're like oh what is Biden done it's hard for me to make an infrastructure uh Bill sexy and [ __ ] you know me that's just that's just that's just being real right and what they do see though is you know even today um Biden eating ice cream talking about there might be a fire on Monday right and so it's hard for me to sell it's hard for me to I don't really want to be selling Biden but it's hard for me to essentially sell anti-trump because people people understand the way that he he markets right Trump is a marketer right Trump is probably the greatest grifting marketing mind of uh since goal in in reality right and people don't get it he he Taps into the social media type of mind give you 140 characters give you something a sound bite Joe Biden don't how where's the sound bites where's it this where's it that do something give give us something to run with right platform the right people [ __ ] Biden I mean not Biden Trump and them even know oh we G yo go do this go do this uh interview with sexy red let that [ __ ] get hot on Tik Tock right but who but oam me who's who's doing that same thing with you has has the Biden campaign set anything up so that you have something going viral no they be on the shade room I see they will send kamla cuz she blackish and they'll send her right on the shade room to do all the work for so she can just talk about you know just her raps and when she was pledging at Howard that's what we get when we have let's talk real policies and what we're doing not the next game that's going to happen let's talk about these real issues oh but also like conservative conservatism is is really sexy to a lot of people right it promises you patriarchy it promises you uh money getting rich getting money getting a good job uh uh uh Trump's whole campaign is make America great again right he's painting a real conservative ideal sis headeral nor normative families where the country doesn't have to worry about nothing everyone has money and they sell that to people and then culturally like what is the Democratic party like selling so like it makes it really hard for me as someone who's like very critical of both political parties I'm like I identify as like Ultra leftist to see um you know um just the lack of attention given to uh where black people are at like culturally politically by any political party and and and and really making an Earnest attempt like I think what Joe Biden does is like he goes to like the black churches when it's when it's time to like campaign and I'm like how you speaking to like the young people out here how you speaking like it's it's like he had for in my opinion it's like he has no investment in terms of like um reach where we at culturally but the Republican parties are tapping Like Rappers and [ __ ] I guess I think the understated um part of this is on what the Republicans are actually selling them on right like I don't think we have to or I don't see myself as having to sell anybody ESP or sell black people let me say specifically I don't feel like I have to sell black people on the Democratic party or sell them on Joe Biden right but there's a reason why black people overwhelmingly 90% vote no matter what is happening how we feel who the candidate is is because the reality is black people have always had to make pragmatic choices and dealing with the world they're in right like everybody else has their Seasons where they go through something that makes them realize the American government doesn't give a [ __ ] about them or give a [ __ ] about people and black people live in that constantly so we don't usually are not the ones that are jumping up like okay I can't be a part of this cuz we were never bought in it's not that we're bought into the Democrats I think often what it what it is is what I think the Republicans have a better time at is the Republicans represent a world that used to be like and the world that has been for most of the time right like what people know and like Republicans there are a lot of things about how we grew up the world we lived in where people were just a lot more bigoted without it being called bigotry and a lot different different ways whereas they're sexist they're homophobic they are you know religion this people were a lot more intolerant in the days of before and so Republicans are able to sell that in their Talking Heads throughout the year right like it's not about election season it's not about everything it's the way that they're able they have think about it they have the biggest the biggest platforms the biggest uh uh comedians the biggest influencers the biggest content creators those the bag is there right like the Candace Owen the money exactly Candace Owen started out on the left right or trying and then that didn't work for her and she quickly pivoted they pivot there because that's where the money is so I think for me I think what I'm starting to wrestle with is not feeling like okay how do I sell what are the Democrats doing wrong or what CU I already know that people on the ground already know that we know what the Democrats are doing wrong we know what we have to try to put them on we know what it is we're trying to make happen I think what it becomes is what are we not not selling to the public well because a conversation I've been having with people recently like I I had this convers TS Madison said this to me it was basically like we smarty black people are not communicating in a way that is is we are we are essentially boxing out you know what I mean a lot of black people from our conversations and I'm starting to wonder if that's like if what we need to be trying to figure out is how how the misinformation black community that that is the biggest online that are biggest of these spaces that people like getting their information from what are they doing how are they packaging in their things and what can we do to better I guess cuz I think what it is is we're not it's not about selling them on the party or the real issue is is is not about telling them on the Democrats the Democrats are not Progressive the Democrats are not to the left what we want is to change social Consciousness in people and in the community right we want to shift and make everybody more Progressive in general and that requires us to be winning the the discourse War throughout the year that we don't win like when the Republicans come up with the culture wars and they make it cool to start attacking them and attacking that and it's it's all the ways that they dominate pop culture discourse and they weaponize all that and and that is what bleeds into by the time the election so I'm like what are we not doing is what I guess I'm wrestling with I feel like um for first of all they not doing much for the black community when it comes they just literally do the bare minimum and it's so sad that we have to ask the question about what are we not doing because the bar is damn so low like we were just discussing you he's flashing sneakers to people and there are actually people who are wearing them and there is a course online where they're like you know what y'all don't really see what he's trying to do they they really will try to and then those things go viral you know why because those those social media pages that give the misinformation they like those viral moments and they will push that they will push those uh look what Donald Trump said Donald Trump is doing and we will miss those moments of here's what Biden said or here's what this local leader said or here's what this they will we will miss all of those moments or here's what is happening with police they all of these things are missed moments but they will any that Donald Trump comes out and said because it is entertainment all of those social media sites do but is is that what we need to be doing because I have seen the White House on Tik Tok and um uh what's her name kamla doing the you know little dances and stuff and they go viral but it's I don't I don't know what else we need to be doing except it's like it's hard because the bar is that low I don't know how to get in you're right about like how do we get into people's mind I know um back what four years ago was it like maybe 2021 or what 2022 um when the elections were happening uh state senators all that good stuff was it 2020 it's been so long the pandemic years but um I remember when we had Cliff Albright uh on our show many times um local Representatives here out of Georgia um on on the show and they were for for a while on the ground making sure that um photo suppression wasn't happening because a lot of people were being attacked for living at the on the same address of a business um you know they were making sure that people were understanding the change of rules that were happening the attacks that were happening at the pole place no matter they were doing the work they were on the ground and they're still doing it now but we don't hear much about that when it's fancy when it was good like a few years ago when it was popular to be pictured outside you know rallying and the photo ops that was cute but now it's like Trump is funny and that that's why can I just jump in cuz I think that number one I've conceded that we're not going to get every vote like half the country doesn't vote right so what we're trying to do is we're trying to get the margins the people that are more passive that are not super engaged the engaged people are going to vote that's not necessarily the people that we have to worry about now we can activate them to be the messengers to help get those people that aren't as engaged so that's where our power lies in um and and activating those that are already engaged to go further and then hopefully swing people on the margins that don't really know what which way to go don't really know what to think don't think that this impacts them I think if we're talking about receipts if we're talking about accomplishments I think our job is easier aside from of course the whole Israel Gaza thing which is a disaster it's unconscionable and indefensible but I think in terms of having tangibles I don't know that's the buzz word having tangibles to go back to the black community and say listen this Administration has actually been deliberate in targeting policies that specifically impact our community like the pave plan which was about eliminating home o home ownership appraisal bias like what was happening with the bomb threats at HBCU giving them grants like what's happened unprecedented attention has been put to Black maternal mortality because of Vice President KLA Harris and we can go on down the line a number of things that they've done really with that focus on the black community even even though the student loan debt stuff got got uh overturned by the Supreme Court there was a strategy that they had to make black people disproportionately benefit from that by using the whole pilgram criteria so that black people disproportionately get double the cancellation and so we're not in a position where they ain't done nothing we can't tell nobody what's happened diabetes being $35 insulin um is something that disappo impacts our community we do have some specifics to go back with but the reality is that we're not going to win the algorithm more we don't have the funding we don't have the backing of the democratic party in the same way as you all pointed out Candace Owens or Charlie Kirk who at 18 years old got a multi-million dollar check to start up this [ __ ] uh you know University or whatever the Democrats aren't Str strategic that way so we have to organically do that and the way we do that is by cumul cumulative credibility maybe all of our videos don't go viral but I know having a radio show that's a call-in show over time you move the needle you're not going to move it to win an election but you're going to move it enough to where it's going to have an impact on a cumulative basis with enough people and that's the best that we can do until we get some real money behind us yeah so can I ask a question because I I think I'm hearing two different things right now and I just want to make sure I'm clarified in my own heads because what my interest in is not I mean sure we got to like vote for Biden so on and so forth because you don't really have a choice it is what it is my interest is in moving people left right in a country that I feel like has gone further right in the last eight years even more right than when Obama was President um which is wild but um but I feel like if we're talking about because we know the black community for the most part is going to go out and vote for the Democratic party they're going to go out and vote for Biden right my interest is is looking at 2020 how do I make sure that a Biden doesn't happen again that's my actual personal interest right because I feel like a lot of people on here um we're surrogates for Bernie we're surrogates for Warren we're surrogates for different people so on and so forth whatever um and and ultimately whoever you were surrogate for whoever you were supporting you got Biden at the end of the day right like and when we're talking about people on the fringes um I don't think you know just being being really honest right when I'm talking to friends that I grew up with or whatever nobody wants to hear about nothing but Gaza nobody like right now like nobody wants to hear anything about any of the policy and I'm being really honest right I'm not when I'm when I'm if I'm the other day I was playing ball and I'm like yo everybody's like yo we not on vote and [ __ ] this year [ __ ] Trump I mean [ __ ] um Biden that's literally everybody right and so and so I do think you actually do really need more right not necessarily in the way of policy but in the way I don't know what it is yeah like um to add uh we we got to be honest with black people about like what they've seen and what has transpired going all the way back to like 2016 right like uh um and to like for me to move people left that takes Grassroots organization it takes really literally like just the bare bones of like knocking on doors and getting in contact with people takes online conversations like this but it also takes something to fundamentally change about uh black people's lives and and and the politics that they encounter we've seen the Democrat Party say no to free healthcare we've seen them say no to free college and universities and so like I we're often in this moment where what Biden or any of the Democrat politician do is kind of like from a top down effect and not from a bottom up effect in which black people are ideating our own policy ideating our own agendas and implementing them and seeing them and watching them getting passed like we haven't substantially seen that which is why more people are are are disinvested and backing away and have this apathy and so like how do we solve you know that friction one one quick thing um man y'all this is this is the core conversation right because y'all make me think about two fundamental structural problems that we have to answer your question Olay one of the reasons we don't have the money it's not the money is there right but the money is on the side of capital and the more they know deep in their hearts that black folks have a critical analysis we have a class critique we understand the economics of this thing they have no interest in actually pouring money into us not just because we're black but because we have a class critique but now you dig in a little deeper though I I I look at the Democratic party and I ask myself the same questions you all are asking yourself why aren't they putting money into it into the black into black media like they should like they need to like they need us to show up and vote for them like why aren't they doing that and I think there's a structural problem there too because do you really think that the white folks in this country no matter what party are actually interested in black power being able to organize at a level where we aren't dependent on them to go and reach our black folks you know they couldn't really have a black infrastructure here in the United States of America that could operate autonomously separate from the political power structure right now I think those are two structural impediments for us uh yeah I think I think that is fair something I like the I think about what the sides is it's a lot easier for the right to mobilize because they're not they're not in it for the legitimate reasons right a lot of the people on the right and their spokespeople their politicians don't even believe the [ __ ] that they're saying they don't live their lives in accordance with that they have they have a United Mission they're there for like a particular agenda however you want to characterizing it advancing whiteness capitalism the status quo however have you that's what the agenda is so they can all get on board with that they don't need to like like all the rest of us we have true different like true things we're passionate about we see it this way we believe these systems and we have you know disagreements ways and approaches that we want and that create it's you can't get on one Accord if you genuinely have different Accords you know um so I think that makes it I think that makes it a lot more difficult for us on this end right like that's a word o that that a preach right there you can't get on one Accord if you genuinely all have different Accords that's a good point time but you're right yeah every time we get into the space at anytime I even look for conversations that are happening online from people in the media who are having these conversations you know on YouTube uh a lot of content creators it's like everybody wants to F like when it's even talking about this particular thing some people are not helping in my opinion with just the you know what Biden ain't good you know we I I could feel that way too because and they and these same people um these black content creators uh who speak about politics um mostly they'll say you know we understand and I've said this I've made sure that hey but voting is serious V people have literally fought for us to be able to do this like you were saying reesi like people can't always just think on Biden and God I I'm frustrated about that too Biden STS on it the blood on his hands how he just been nonchalant about it this you know how they're partnering with Israel I I'm I'm with everybody on that um but that we can't just say hold your vote you know before be P did he was canceled remember back in the day it was voter die that same man that said said vo or die turned around spent the block and told people to hold they vote so that this is why I saying it's we can't do that though because our vote is very important and for a time people were dying people couldn't do it people couldn't black folks couldn't vote they couldn't do it it was it and they didn't know that at this time they knew at some time maybe not in their lifetime one day we will be able to vote so this the easiest thing this like we can't just be like oh I ain't going to vote because where Biden stand there are so many other reasons for you to be able to vote and I think that that's the thing that we need to figure out how to get into people but when a lot of people who are going viral are the ones with these simple ass talking points where just like you know don't vote Bor hold your vote our votes are important just hold it because we not we not we not eing with Biden that's not enough but you know it's also rough to what Fred uh Fred was saying earlier about how people feel right now on Palestine if they don't want to hear [ __ ] sometimes like you can make I I have tried trust me I've made every kind of argument like I put the argument in short form long form tried at all all the ways on why you know voting is still this and why Biden is still the the choice or whatever over Trump the way people see it is no matter what you say I could explain to people all the reasoning this is a response I've seen a lot they will be like oh that's good that's cool that's all very well and cool Olay that might be right but like they you shouldn't have to do lip service the de the Democrats should be doing it the Democrats are doing this or what like they have this attitude and what I've noticed consistently is like people keep thinking they're going to spite the Democrats and it's like it's like to cut off your nose to spite your face [ __ ] I'm like who do you think you're hurt the Democrat like I and don't get me wrong I understand I I don't want to I don't want to I'm not blowing down on anybody who feels like they can't vote because of Palestine and this and the next thing but just as far as you making the argument people don't even have the energy that's they don't even want to hear from you on it like even if you say you respect what they're doing if you explain why you think this this and the next thing like I've explain for me it's not about a lesser of two evils thing it's a it's a who's the weakest adversary like what what I think people fail to understand is that the no I don't believe that the Democrats are any political party or who are the progressive champions of the world or who are moving us left or anything like that or that the Democrats do anything because they because they agree with us on the left no I I recognize they have the same Capital interest and all these different things but the Democrats voter base that's who it's the organizers on the ground it's the people who vote that are who are creating and pushing the bills and all the progressive change and the bail reform and all these different things and they are not able to make those things happen under rep Publican administrations and those are the things that I'm thinking about but you say that and I'm immediately like chopped off at the head but people are like but genocide but genocide and even when you and even if you point out I'm like America is an imperialist Nation the pales yes I agree America this is a genocide this is absolutely wrong I made a whole doc about it I am 100% alignment with that but America is an imperialist nation that this was what they were always going to do they've always aided Israel this is not the first people that they are financially funding the genocide of it's not even now even when you see people be like oh until I get a ceasefire I can't vote for Biden I'm like Biden have been killing for helping the the United States government has been aiding the the killing of people all across this world from time and still and currently and the Congo and all kind of places that you don't know I don't really and again if we had if it wasn't B if it's not Donald Trump is on record right now he's up telling you exactly how much worse he would be he's criticizing Biden for being too soft on the issue you know so I'm like and then when you say that people go oh but you're saying but Trump a trump a trump that's a Democrats old argument and it's like this isn't about me trying to be a cherleader from the Democrat I'm just telling you realistically like that's realistically who will be president if not Joe Biden so I don't know how you don't want me to contend with that reality so I just don't know what to do at this point I've said I've said listen are go ahead a republican Administration means everything you're getting with Israel and Gaza right now plus war with Iran so do you want nuclear war or no like you know but the reality is every vote every voter is not a getable vote and you can say respect and move on to the next group of people like I have 100 if if you want to vote your conscience and you say I'm not going with Biden because of Israel Gaza respect let me go talk maybe I can get the sexy red group people who said Trump gave me a sty maybe I can help convert some of those people like there are 80 million people out there who did not vote in the 2020 election that's a big ass pool of people that we can hopefully tap into and it's not going to be a viral video even those videos that go viral look at those accounts that go viral they have a million likes and th000 people follow them you know it's a flash in the pan moment it's that cumulative credibility that's going to move the needle not this particular video not this thing that was trending not something that captured people who already don't vote and they on like rah rah raah yeah we not voting train it's the people that vote and it's the people that we can get on the fringes to come with us that really anything else is a distraction and and if people want their part th those non-voters or those people who have particular interests the onus is on them to put the pressure on these politicians to get their agenda enacted and for the rest of us we can we can do what we can do to try to get the people that are already engaged or the people who maybe we can win I think we can win some of the sexy red Trump gave me or semi people maybe we can that's an easier gift for me at this point than than other groups so that's kind of where I feel like let's one of the things that is that this is powerful at is actually making us feel a little bit more like helpless making us feel a little bit more like what's the point you know there's so many people that feel this way we have to stay focused on the people that are getable whoever else ain't getable hey that's cool fine whatever see you later bye have a nice life good luck yeah yeah I I think I I I don't disagree with that but I think we have to also look at the numbers right so the reality of it is is that while Joe Biden had the most votes in history Trump had the second most votes in history and and what it took for Biden to have those votes was people coming from the fringes not just on the left and and people who are you know self-proclaimed Progressive but also Republicans coming over as well to get Biden over the hump right you look at places like Michigan you know where you kind of can't you know for especially you know places where you know have people out of noi and so on and so forth you can't just say oh forget y cuz it's a swing state you know the reality of it is is that you really actually do need those people cuz that's going to come down to a few thousand folks and and what I and and again and I don't think that it's a matter of being like oh wo is us it's impossible I think we have to have honest real conversations to figure out Solutions because we did fear in 2020 right we we did look we got to go out because you know Trump is this and and Biden is that but he's not Trump we so the same things that like the expectation of us in 2024 is what happened in 2020 right and so I think what a lot of people have you know outside of even Gaza is like hey you came to me in 2020 you said the same things I rocked with you and you know even even even in in in education right as as an author a lot of a lot of saying oh we're getting frustrated with Biden right A lot of them are really frustrated with Biden and not knowing like hey I don't know if I need to vote because da d da but that's how people are feeling that's how some people feel it's not like oh every educat is feeling this way but even if you have two out of a thousand that's who actually matters in a tight ass election so I guess I have a so I have a special cocktail of perspective or or of on this because I'm an immigrant and when I say immigrant I mean in the status way right because like when you say that people think I mean your parents came as the Immigrant and no I me came I'm the immigrant right now right so uh at the mercy of USCIS people always they do this thing I see this a lot they're always like oh you know we did this in 2016 we did y'all did this in 2016 like as though like we we we cried wolf and the Wolf wasn't real the wolf was [ __ ] real and I think sometimes what I have a problem with is and this has always been my issue like I've been in America now since I was 14 I'm 30 now and I still I can't vote you know I'm a lawyer I'm politically involved all that but I can't vote and I'm always have the mercy of what Americans do with that election right and with with with the 2016 election immigration was catastrophic as an immigr I've never I'm telling you what I felt like going through the immigration system like most of my friends from the Bahamas most of the people that I knew that were International students are back where they came from you know uh it was I barely by the skin of my teeth got a Visa uh um so I'm like when people fail Americans sometimes often think forget that this is a country that advertises itself as a Melting Pot to the rest of the world and it has a significant amount of people that live in this country with real lives that are affected that cannot have a say in the system so very people are not allowed to say [ __ ] so you don't hear from them they're at the mercy of immigration system and all this so then like Americans who have the ability to like hold hands and make decisions based on their conscience and their morals and all of this different stuff and and virtues and I understand that but they'll be like you know they'll act like it doesn't matter or the wolf was scary it's like yo the wolf was so real the people it ate up you don't know about you don't hear about you're not hearing about from the immigrants in those stories who live that and I'm not saying that the Democrats are good on immigration I want to be clear they're all [ __ ] bad immigra they're all bad immigration but in 15 years of being in this country I've never been at the almost out of this country until Donald Trump was there that's one that's the first time I've been going to Embassy all my life I I was getting denials when like true fear was felt in the room like when I think about the fact that I'm still in an immigration system and if Donald Trump becomes president again I'm like I don't my chances you know in two by the time I get a a decision on a on a Visa is you know it looks different so I sometimes I want to think about them when people feel like oh we can't do the 20 16 again it's like it's not I don't feel like it's like people think it's a ploy it's not it's not a ploy I'm trying to tell you that because it's true unfortunately like it's true you know that's what they need to be invested in what you just said is not going viral right that's that's the entired that's that's the bar that's that's the bar what you just said right if if that's that's it right there but that's that's the frustrating part you have that on Tik Tok put $10,000 behind it you might have swung a few people on the on the fringes because they're like yo yeah I'm not going to front my you know this and that third my you know yeah that's that's but they're not doing that yeah true and and it sucks that we have to worry about it going viral but that's the the world we live in right now right that's where that's how people are getting their information very quickly lots of misinformation going out very very quickly but these conversations are super important um like I said reesi was saying like if we just focus and you said too Olay if we really just focus because we I know we're it's frustrating us too it's frustrating us having to sit at the the the damn kitchen table and your daddy who's an immigrant they done told his behind that Trump is better and he's thinking it's good and I'm like Dad like you said let's run it back to 2016 right when the same people that were your friends at work were were telling you to go back to your country let's not let's go back let's go back and have that conversation but also all of these different things like remember if we go back and we go we go go into remembrance and we go back to 2016 and we we say about how he talked to immigrants how he treated immigrants how he was shooting down DACA any anything that was going he was shooting it down um and a lot of immigrants felt it like you said Olay and then I never felt so black in my life like I never felt like I I just I realized from the moment I went into work where it's predominantly white I live in a predominant White City now but when he was um when he became president the church I was at we was praying at at the moment and they were like this is just God's will the accent I gave you yes they were they were white pastors this is just God's will and um you know and I think that God is just going to make sure that he touches I don't give a damn lady I don't want to hear this I'm leaving I went to work the next day what I saw um were people just rooting and saying oh my gosh like all white men just saying you know oh my gosh Trump is President and I'm just like I'm feeling so singled out I went to the bathroom there was a Hispanic girl crying in there because they were saying jokes to her at in her tech office where they were telling her like you probably got to go back to your country Maria like little jokes like that and getting away with with it and she was in the bathroom crying then we started to see people walking out in the streets with tiki torches that they got from Walmart in the name of trump because I think they were trying to take monuments down then we heard about both sides of situations how he was both siding things instead of calling a thing a thing so much happened People's Health Care was trash just because he gave you an extra some extra dollars on your tax Meanwhile your child can't get no Health Care you can't get no Health Care like did you get a job wasn't it a struggle for you so many things were happening during that time and if we that's where the information is the true information is and if we're able to deliver that I know it might be two people but if with just the how Rea was saying online if it just touches one person if it just touch one person but can I can I say I think I I will say this I'll speak for myself I feel a responsibility to not just give voice to people's frustration but to be a thought leader in terms of putting their frustration in context and trying to offer Solutions and prescriptions it's not enough to just say black people feel it this way black people did da da we have to talk to black people and and inform them okay I I I respect that I honor that I hold space for that but you have to understand and run down the list I will dot dot dot dot dot your ass in a second you know but I think that what a lot of people are looking for and I'll speak I'll talk about black people is this big shoe to drop the shoe is dropping every freaking day I mean if we look at what's happening as we are three women sitting on this panel we are not National citizens anymore because we do not have B well sorry you know you're immigrant but I'm saying we're we're the two of us are not American citizens because our bodily autonomy depends on the location of where we're placed at that given moment we cannot move freely if you want to have an abortion and you want to go to this state your ass can be hunted down from the state that you came from that's not National citizenship anymore and so the citizenship is already out the window for women right and then depending on which state you are when you have state in Florida where Ronda santis removed a democratically elected State's Attorney from her position that's no longer a democracy where he held uh positions open seats open for hundreds of thousands of black voters and he did it for months that's not a democracy so everywhere around the country where Republicans be clear are in power our citizenship is already under assault and so whatever people are looking for a big January 6 moment that should have been enough but it's happening daily and we need to wake the hell up about it this isn't a a crywolf situation this isn't well let's talk about 2016 2020 it's literally happening IVF in Alabama it's literally happening where Republicans are racking up winds and the media is focusing on Biden being damn old which he was old in 2020 and you know black black a lot of black people that are being platform are focused on whatever policy they think that Biden should have gotten that did it or their person or their personal gripe I I I feel like there's a lot of I see from a lot of commentators it feels like they have their own like it feels like a personal animist towards uh you know your mad part and not not not an unbiased and like I mean an unfair personal animist but that personal animus is like motivating what they're being they're telling people to do I'm wondering if like what we need to do is start telling people or maybe not telling people what they could do or explaining to people what people are already doing on the grounds because you'll say that I know how this is I I literally know how people respond to everything online now you'll say that Reesey and someone will be like and what have the Democrats done if the Democrats aren't you all say the Republicans are Fascist but the Democrats aren't fighting fascism that's what they'll say but I'm like what actually happens how these things work is all there first of all there's countless legislation people say that but they're not actually that involved with what's happening locally or how it's happening who the council members are what laws are being passed or any of that stuff so but what happens is there are groups there are nonprofits there are organizers activists there are people on the ground who are quite literally pushing legislation lobbying for different things and they are making that happen and then they find politicians who they can get an ear to they can explain to who they can get to sign on to it like when I think of like the unlock the Box people in California who pushing the end solitary confinement act and they got Cory Bush to sponsor that or that's what's happening and so what I try to explain to people it's not about what the Democrats do or any politician does the politicians do not do the change they're not the ones who push these Progressive things that happened it's actual people but those people need an air they can at least get through to but they the Republicans are a brick wall they cannot get a republican to sponsor you know their end solitary confinement act it's not going to happen so that I think is what I'm wondering if now we got to start I mean maybe widening the scope for people understanding how it really works is then they think nothing else is happened they think if the Dem they see the picture as Democrats issue and politician and so if they don't see the politician doing something they assume nothing is being done or that politician serves no purpose or the party so I'm wondering that yeah Democrats don't get I'm sorry Democrats don't get penal I mean Republicans don't get penalized for any policy maybe except for abortion maybe a little bit but when things don't happen it's both sides you know when Republicans do crazy stuff like you said Democrats don't didn't magically stop them so that's the benefit of being a republican unfortunately for us right one of the things with the wow what Reese just said also the Democrats just seem to me you don't get to that level of success and that level of organizing you don't get a national party and not be aware of some of these things we're talking about I say that to say if the Democrats don't understand the nuances that we're discussing on this show they don't need to be in power and we need people to and I'm not talking about the party I'm not talking about Trump and Biden I'm talking about the infrastructure I'm talking about people who are moving and shaking inside the party who help make these decisions because for them to miss some of the things that we're saying on here it's like it's politics 101 and I don't think it's unintentional I I think it's very intentional that they don't communicate to the black community the way they need to because they can't afford to which is why I suggest I'm not promoting any Democrats I'm promoting black organizing black power we know how many black people going to vote for the Democrats at 90% clip we're organizing black nest for black things for black issues so that we can communicate with ourselves outside of the democratic party outside of the Republican party so people want to know how we doing it for 2024 for me and my house we voting black we we organizing black and we spending our time in the black community and if they happen to vote 90% for the Democratic party then that's kind of what we need yeah in my opinion like they don't want it they don't want it bad in us um we know black folks going like 90% we've been doing that forever you know it was the landmark legislation that got us kind of like locked in with the um Voting Rights Act the Civil Rights Act um that you know LED black people to be Democrats they don't want it bad enough I don't see them actively going out in white communities doing like or trying to swing voters in their Direction um I think we're in a period of time where it does actually like calls for like more like Landmark legislation to come about so that we aren't stuck in this cycle of lesser evils every election so like the story Olay just shared in in regards to her status right how are the Democrats uh thinking about inran more voters incarcerated incarcerated people immigrants like these are ways you can easily like get your numbers up but that's the pro but here's here's my thing why I keep saying to me the war is actually not on the the Dem the the politicians it's on the social Consciousness and moving people left because because we lose these discourse Wars all the time if a Democrat right now let's say a Democrat did propose trying to to get more status for immigrants or immigrants even black immigrants how often I see the discourse then it will be what reei said the immigrants trying to take look how they trying to serve for the immigrants and they don't do for us because what white supremacy does what the Republicans have done what the right has done is they they make marginalized groups attack each other instead of the source right instead of you looking at what this white supremacist capitalist system is you out here trying to fight with another another group that isn't getting anything so that's what'll happen is like that's what I'm saying is like there's a lot of consent for a lot of regressive things that the right wants to see happen that would prevent the left from doing it because it's not just like Democrats Democrats don't just get criticized for not doing anything or even what they actively do they get criticized because people see them as on the side of this new Progressive world that they don't like that they you know what I mean and so that's why I think it's it's not it's more important for us to win I guess to to figure out how we we change how people are seeing some of these things how we counteract a lot of these narratives and it can be really hard I guess is my my original frustrating part is like it's hard to beat it when you are when they're organized on the other side to make sure drown you out in the algorithm and all this especially when people what people have to what I realize is is I swear I can make this make sense I have an autoimmune disorder I recently found out about and everybody else who has the disorder in the Reddit refuses to accept that it's an autoimmune disorder and they need to be on a diet right and it's because you don't want to accept that because you want to eat the way that you have always been eating right like you have a hard time they have a hard time even accepting that it could be true that foods are affecting the way the the disorder feels because it's like I've been eating this way all my whole life and it wasn't a problem so how could that be it now so they they're so if you give them this information that oh it doesn't matter they're going to eat that up because they want it to not matter so I feel like that's a lot of what we see there is people don't like they a lot of people the status quo is what they've known they they so they they are they're like they are more predisposed to having an verion to anything that feels like change and that's what Progressive thought is right like that's not where we're at so everything about even if the Democrats were doing that even if the Democrats were doing it it would be getting shot down because we've we we spent all year thinking that oh it's just diasp for Wars it's just this it's just you know what I mean all these things that you can't to me that's not a coincidence if you go see go look I did this one time go type in [ __ ] on Twitter on and on Twitter and click on most of those accounts and look at who they're following these a bunch of bots following a bunch of Republicans and white supremacist and stuff but that's who's infil Trad in our communities discussions and then people think that's normal and they think it's just a social media discourse but people are going off into the world into the society and feeling this way and then they vote that way and they oppose things that way so that's why I think to me the problem is when it's too late I don't have a problem with the the issue I think you end up with bidens when everyone complains you're in the middle of election season now you mad about the candidates and now you want to you want to suggest people to the Country For the First Time who they've never heard about who they weren't doing [ __ ] during four years or you know you these issues you were letting these discourses go off you were contributing you were watching this [ __ ] you were okay with the viral nonsense you were watching all these right-wing fools on on on their streaming sites you weren't thinking there's anything related as to why academics is on Rumble and all this [ __ ] and then then you're losing the election conversation so that's why I think it's the larger discourses like to Frederick's original I feel like my my my obligation is to move people more left and that's what I'm trying to figure out how I package that even within the recognition that the odds are stacked against us but to what reesei is saying is you don't move for us we can't we can't expect to rely on viral moments we have to expect on being able to move the needle you know slowly and consistently and by by talking to people and so I guess just trying to figure out the best way I also add one thing isn't it funny that there's no merit go no I was goingon to say it's just it's just I'm listening to you synthesize everything that's happened in the last hour of this call and just brilliantly synthesized it and it's it's like it's so frust frustrating that this country isn't really a meritocracy because we wouldn't even be having this conversation because I haven't met a single conservative commentator that can hold a fan to the least on the left but that's the entire point right and I think that plays into your question of whether or not we have to trans change the way we transmit this Brilliance to them but I just had a pause what you did was just brilliant but we do that kind of Brilliance in our content all damn day every day yeah I just want to throw something out there though um part of the problem is that people overestimate how much power Democrats have like we've been having a whole conversation about what Democrats can do what Democrats can do but only 17 states have a democratic Trifecta right now that's a third of the states in this country and so a lot of the people and black people are heavily concentrated in states that actually have Republican trifectas so a part of the problem is that Civics knowledge that we have to try to correct with our people because they're blaming Biden and you sitting up there and K iy State or Tate reev state who's having Confederate heritage month or you know Louisiana they just elected a governor mostly through an action and not voting that is trying to do all kind of heinous things with the criminal justice system and so part of what we can help do I think is explain to people where the power is who you should really be mad at and then how you get those people that you really mad at out of power as opposed to like you said earlier cutting off your nose to spite your face you thinking that you're sticking into the Democrats they weren't in power to begin with so how are you really moving the needle with them so I think that people overestimate because the you know the Democrats have had the White House for much of the past two decades how much power is actually concentrated with Democrats and Democrats alone I thought about so I think so I think again you're right um I also think that two things can be true cuz we're talking about moving people left right but we have to also understand that the Democrats overwhelmingly the Democratic establishment is not really left right and so what also happens is as you're moving people further left people becoming um dis uh disillusioned with okay well I'm supporting Corey bush look how they just did Corey Bush right and things like that and things like that happened so we have to have honest conversations that again people I don't think that people are not civically aware I actually think more people are becoming civically aware than ever in history in my personal opinion I think that um especially young people um thanks to you know following certain people on Tik Tok and things like that and following people who are here and learning from everybody who's here on this call right now but we can't blame um people for doing the work and not and not really call out that a lot of the democratic establishment actively counteracts the work in real time right it's hard to go into a black community as one of us speak to you know the brothers the sisters so on and so forth and then ultimately have a policy that comes out like I you know I was at um um a a ceremony um that was honoring um you know the late brother Malcolm X uh recently and they were going to honor um H I forget his name he's a he's a he's a politician here in New York City we're about to honor him you'll uh oh you don't know who I'm talking about but I gotta remember hope not Adams hell no hell no hell no like I think's like the bur president of the Bron or something like that I forget his name some something you know whatever and they couldn't even honor he's a Democrat they couldn't even honor him because he's in support of something around Reich is right so it's like you know what I mean like and he's and he's a Democrat so then everybody in the room is like oh I'm not rocking with him next time but then what happens if the next time it's it's some Republican who is going against him right so we have to have the real conversations about the work is happening we're moving people left and also um Democrats are not to blame for everything and also sometimes they are we have to have a real Dynamic conversation with people you know yeah I think too like we we really have to be but honest we have to be real about like you know knowing that whoever we like I was we were having this conversation Ben sometimes I go to church you know and I don't like what the pastor said I don't really care for it I don't like it I don't want to hear it I'm going home that doesn't mean I'm not going to come back next Sunday I like my church okay so I'm like okay so at the end of the day there's going to be there's leaders who are in place right now Democratic leaders who aren't doing their job they're not supposed to be there um that but that does does that mean that we're just going to be like I I'm not going to I'm I'm not siding with them because this one person is doing this thing they're not going to do everything that you want to do I don't like a lot of things that Biden has done does that mean that he hasn't done great things no but at the same time let's keep on voting closer to where we can make some changes if you vote towards and and then you're going to sit there and have that argument with people meanwhile you're going to be like that's why I really rock with Trump when he's done a way more things he's a criminal right he's done way more things to cause division but yet you're just like stuck on the stemy and but you won't you won't rock with these dims because that one little thing that you were like I I can't I can't that's why I don't like Democrats it's but if we have if we have these platforms and we have these conversations and they are available somewhere in the algorithm atmosphere for somebody to fall on maybe they can be educated by this this you know these types of videos or you know sit down and actually have these conversations understand how they can have these conversations in their communities um we can't give up that's just where it's at it's it's hard it really is sometimes I just want to go to sleep and just not be bothered with anything but that won't I don't have kids yet so what does that look like for me if I um don't vote for somebody in this particular community that I live in that's predominantly white where I have had run with police officers where they have um looked at me crazy when I go into stores where jobs won't take me because of when they find out that I'm black like who am I voting for here if I don't if I want to stay here in this area and I have kids in the next 5 years what does Insurance look like for them like know who you're voting for know what your community is don't just say I'm not going to vote so if we all collectively and this is where the problem is we be on 10 different pages you know but when it comes to this one thing when it comes to voting I think if we all collectively stick in that same place uh and and and have that same message I think that that's where the power comes from that's where the power can I throw one number out there just one number to Rebecca's point about you know the party isn't any individual there are 59,6 182 elected officials in this country of all Stripes 96% of those people are local elected officials 3.6% are State and 0.1% are federal you could come up with an antidote for even 100 Democrats that suck but it's 100 out of 519,000 and so I just want us to keep in perspective like I said 17 Democratic trifectas 519,000 elected officials that's not even counting appointees and all this other kind of stuff there's a lot of power that's dispersed in this country and yet it seems like there isn't that kind of context in the critiques that we sometimes Lobby and sometimes the critiques that we're even trying to to challenge you need to send that CLI to DNC that clip right there too see you just need to clip all this uh DNC that just clip all that no you know you you're absolutely right I've been I I've been thinking about this I think we I think we have to interrogate the why things that happening right like sometimes like you know I had a in when I was in law school I I went to a prosecutor Mill and I became a public defender but my most everybody I did I knew became a a prosecutor and some of those people are even most most those people in my heart don't have not everybody who's a villain in the story they are a villain but not they didn't wake up and think they were a Villain Like I have a I had a friend named n RA in law school who would explain to me why he wanted to be a prosecutor and he would have the same answer for why I want to be a public defender up until the point we'd be saying the same thing until it stars off and then you what you have to interrogate is the why it STS off like what do you think about the world how do you perceive the world that makes you think that that's the answer and sometimes there are a lot of people and even a lot of politicians who are working against different views on the world the way that they see the world that makes them operate differently like I was interviewing someone for cop about cop City just before this where cop City we have nothing but black Democrats in in office right and this is happening but it isn't the same the I think why the why is important is when you look at this and you go well why how how does this place that this like black black metropolitans decide I'm going to have this this major [ __ ] cop city right and it's when when she kind of I was able to put the lens back when you think about it it's like all right you have this massively black City where they feel this idea of black capitalism black Hollywood right like this myth of black black Excellence black capitalism right of feeling like oh this is how we you know we this is how we make ourselves respected as this like black Mecca right we prove to the white people in this that we going to have all these police that this is safe that we have a control we have a handle on all these Negroes that you're not going to see the kind of Uprising you saw after Ray Shard Brooks in 2020 and how she put it and I'm like I could see how black people in a political system like that where they've been raised in the world to believe in in Black capitalism like you get from a lot of our pop culture icons from the Jay-Z's from the this that's being fed to us how they see what they're doing is the right thing even though we obviously see we see like you are helping create mass incarceration in a prison industrial complex for your people you are you trying to attack Bale this is a fascist State and all this but you could see how in a world where you see you see yourself as uplifting the black community by attracting wealth to it or you know respectability politics and and that's why I think what It ultimately comes down to is teaching people is how else we shift the needle the left is how we debunk and demystify these kinds of things that we have been we've bought into and we've been indoctrinated to believe as a community because a lot of the harmful things you see our community go for that's hard for us to convince them against it's because they've been being FedEd and enforced it for quite some time yeah I the thing yes Olay I I don't disagree with you I I I think I agree with you probably up until that fork in a row where we're about to go in different directions on this because I think it's on purpose I think they know I think I think a lot Adam from black Democrats in the in in in in Atlanta who are particip and Andrew Dickens I can't remember his name good I'm so upset with that negro but they do things they they they do things they are so educated they are so professional they have been in this game they're not new to this they are true to this you cannot tell me they have not taken into consideration the ramifications of their decisions and I I I apply that to Joe Biden I apply that to everybody because I you do not get as far as you do in this political system and not know the power of your philosophy and what I've done for many years I'm not going to speak for anybody else but I gave them the benefit of the doubt that maybe they don't know maybe I could just explain it better maybe if I say it this way maybe I do it and then one day I realized oh they knew the whole time yeah this I mean they intended to move the goal post they never intended to do right by us and I don't care if they're black I don't care if they're white I don't care if they're democrat or republican when they have sided with the police state and capital they are going to do the same exact strategy because they have the same Playbook that's been literally printed out and sent state by state agreed I 100% agree and I believe that they know that what I believe is that it's become like like what I mean to say this is this when I say to black people in my real life that I know the average black person I know in my life is is not an abolitionist like me or you know what I mean or all the way to the left like me they don't think or identify themselves as being against the black community or black people when they feel like some of these [ __ ] just got to get locked up or you know what I mean like when they want to listen to the Dr Umar and tell them oh some of these [ __ ] got to go for good you know it's just somewhere a problem like that is a that kind of thinking that we are like just in our regular lives just being up brought in our own communities to believe that like some of us just a problem some of them can't do nothing some people you can't help you know what I mean just always looking at it from there is what I think is a is that belief system like that not seeming bad that not seeming innately problematic or anti-black or innocuous is by the time you combine that with power and access to money and blah blah blah they're like some of these nigg you know what I mean and they're okay with having their little black Hollywood even though the like 60% of the black people in Atlanta are impoverished you know that's what I mean but definitely that they bad you know I believe Eric Adams knows he's the devil I know he wake up and say it every morning I think I think Benjamin's point I'm be honest with you um I I think that on here most of you at this point occupy the political organizing sphere more than I do um I've been more in like a literature sphere sphere for the last few years um these [ __ ] know and I'm not gonna name no names on here but like I'll be in conversation talking about certain things and and [ __ ] be like I ain't posting about that my [ __ ] because [ __ ] these [ __ ] I'm trying to get this bread and that's and that's ver that is ver that is ver about once and I went to I went to business school with [ __ ] too right and every one of them you know some of them I still see imp passing like yo you still on that on that um that old [ __ ] you better focus on this bread people know yeah those are conversations that happen I've been in the room with your favorite activist and these are the conversations that they have um I would never cuz I ain't no snitch but I would never have you know I would never say those things but this is true who do you I mean I ain't gonna lie some days I'll be like you know what I'm G stand on business when I'm having these conversations because I know they're they're really important and sometimes I do got to disconnect I got to disconnect I don't want to fight people at the family dinner table I don't want to fight people when I'm just shopping for groceries so but I do understand like people do that you would think they they know this is 100% the ones that are especially higher up you see them doing well like things are going for them you know they they know and they know how what they had to do to get there um and if we look at their history some things we we've probably covered where we like this particular [ __ ] did this particular thing um and that's why we really don't want to rock with him but and I'm pretty sure we have old videos talking about KLA Harrison's history um now Fanny Fanny Willis who we're w with in the moment but like we know that we may not again agree with their stuff but those people they do know and that some of them aren't doing it for the right reasons that's why it's very important to go back to Ben's Point listen sometimes we just got to say f all them even though they're the facial representation you know uh they're the people that people post about we really got to really connect here in these spaces get to who we can get with um and who who we can get with who we can talk about who we can place on our shows um who are doing the work and have these conversations um you know more fluently uh and be able to educate better I think that's it's more important for that CU them [ __ ] if it's up to them if a check flies across their face they're they'll just go for it and we won't see them post anything important anymore it's always been like that too can I but let me let me can I cuz I'm the encyclopedia on K here so I ain't gonna be no punk and sit up here and act like that's not my girl and I haven't supported her since the way before the 2020 primary so I just want to put that out I'm not going to get into my boom boom boom on VP I'mma go ahead we going keep the conversation but anybody that see this they're not going to be like oh she just sat there and this oh she said that was me I follow Mina I follow her niece yeah but but to Ben's point it's it's always been like that I would say also like uh back in the day like in the 60s like the the preachers were like the first influencers and so like it reminds me of like history of like uh Martin Luther King coming to Chicago right and doing a like anti- slum slums campaign trying to get people like Free Housing right the first people he had to deal with was the other black preachers in Chicago who were voting Democrat at the time they were voting Democrat big mayor daily and it was like look get out of Chicago you messing up our money we're being paid by by by the big Democrat mayor to basically stifle all protest progressivism and to like instill and go along with the ok so yeah we we we're we're stuck we're stuck in this in this Frame I I guess we just keep on repeating the same stuffs of like history and I'm wondering how do we break free you know out of that Dynamic regime change education there a reason why to me it's a they it's understated on purpose in the media but it is not a coincidence that after the rise of black lives matter and protest and all this they've been after education tooth and [ __ ] nail is education like Republicans do not have a Playbook of teaching anybody anything they just vent people from learning it's that it prevent other people from hearing from from hearing the message and to be to be fair to some people I think like it isn't all that everybody wants to be grifters or be selfish or to only advocate for you know what they think they're not going to get push back and I think what happens is people get disenchanted with you with trying to your heart is in the place of wanting to help your the black community right you you you feel you recognize you know enough to realize pushing us left us knowing these certain things or how these structures work harm us it's really rough when the majority of the black for not through any not the majority or who you're talking to online but the in this discourse you feel uh hold a lot of these views that that you're trying to challenge like you're trying to get them to to to let go of because it harms them but they but they they holding it tight so they view you as the enemy so you feel you're on a losing fight getting cussed out every day being talked about like you don't understand like you not really with the black community so eventually you feel like well I'm Los I'm literally people I think people just get tired and they say well you know what let me just focus on what I could focus on let me focus on my life my household my children my this because why am I doing this I feel like I I get cussed out all the damn time by people and and very often like the people who will I've said this all the time the people who will Champion reability politics to me will be the black people who be the first ones cut from the room because they don't need the qualifications like they will be arguing with you to to assume a mantle that hurt like active hurts them I'm like I'll be fine I'm a lawyer blah blah blah and then I'm like that's you baby they coming for it'll be the people in the shade room comments telling you to be a class AI [ __ ] your family members people your church friends all the people at the the clubs trying to have political conversations with you I just you know it just be a whole lot and um but it it's them how you're gonna have the issues you're sitting here and you're not really thinking about your future it's real cute right now it was real cute when you was getting PPP loans but what is your future going to look like now you want to vote for whoever you want to just rock with these people let's be what they have they kids saying let's be effing for real right let's be serious right let's start really thinking about our futures and how that's going to affect us our future families how we want uh our housing to be uh food the economy what does that look like for you these are actually important things that will affect you they will I think we have to recognize that politics is not altruism nothing is going to be bestowed on us because we're black and we you know we deserve it or whatever it's all transactional and the part of that transaction is voting you know and so when you don't vote you're irrelevant that's why you can you know politicians can get away with disregarding certain demographics because those people don't vote or they don't vote in the margins they need to or in the proportions that they need to vote to and so I think the same way that we want something in return we have to recognize that we have something to give and that is our vote and so I think that you know part of the problem is that people are looking at Politics as though it's supposed to be charity as though it's supposed to be a personality contest that I really like this person I like who they are and what they're about and it's all transactional if you pick the right person then more of those transactions will benefit you as opposed to harm you if you don't pick anybody then you're at the mercy of the people who are doing the picking but everybody has some power and they're either using it or they're abdicating it and I'm trying to get our people to understand that whatever you don't use you're abdicating to somebody who has opposing views maybe that opposing view is a more conservative Democrat maybe that opposing view is a Maga person either way anytime you're not exercising your power you're abdicating it yeah and y'all remember in in all these um here's a great example this is Beyonce's internet right um and so we remember when the beyon just last minute start wore the what is his name beeto hat right and he still didn't so it's it's it's if you really educate these people Beyonce can't make folks go out and vote if she can't like if she can't do it then I mean like we we got she came in last minute too so they weren't educated she was just Beyonce wearing a hat what did the people learn from that not a thing just Beyonce wearing the Hat of this person you know and so if we have the power cuz we do have it to educate and to push you know uh uh these our black people into understanding why they should be voting how they have like there's a power in their hands people fought for this right for them um historically like listen this is your right don't let none of these people take it from you the right want the right Republicans conservatives want you to feel this way they want you to feel like you have no like there's no choice for you this this isn't isn't going to affect you either way they want you to feel that way and we need to definitely utilize this to um to put that out as a lie that's lying that's misinformation I think you know um so I'm uh I'm a generational what is it a descendant of uh what's adol stand for American descendant descend slave so my family my family knows to vote Democrat regardless what's going on my family knows oh we're gonna vote Democrat this third I think that to a certain extent even and you bringing up uh Betto uh Rebecca and the Beyonce post we said a little while ago that we need to be honest with black voters I think that was Charles who said that right like we need to be honest with black voters the Democratic party whether we talking about the establishment or we talking about leftist or we talking about progressives stop talking to [ __ ] like they stupid right like I don't know like I feel like just like for me the takeaway from this entire conversation is like stop talking to [ __ ] like they stupid really do something nobody's dumb we know that Biden has faults we know that Biden has done some positive things we when when kamla goes to you know talk at um whatever uh you with with what's what's this [ __ ] name um the short little the short dude um with radio show goddamn the she to him or whatever when she go talk to him or whatever and she's like oh well you know my people I grew up cooking d d [ __ ] if you don't talk about some policies man like I don't I don't want nobody wants to like like focus on that and I'm not saying that because you have stuff there but instead of trying to Pander right the Beyonce could have probably actually got bet some hits if Beyonce would have posted about some policies instead of posting with a bet hat right if y'all want black people to do certain things stop treating [ __ ] like they dumb have real conversations about what you have done and what you haven't done and that's where you start stop paning but I think I think to be fair that's exactly what she has been doing I remember when she was on charlem man show in that particular interview trust me like I said I'm an encyclopedia so she talked about her rent relief she talked about um the the um the the uh lift act it's been a long time the lift act giving people $500 a month cash payments which is what they ended up doing under the administration with the child tax credit she talked about all those things what went viral smoking weed in Tupac when she was on charlot man show at the beginning of the administration now I'm not a charl man fan be clear okay but she talked about what they're doing around lead pipes she talked about the child tax credit w we viral Charlemagne you know clapping back at her about Biden so the problem isn't as much whether or not policy is being discussed the policy is that there's no the problem is there's no appetite for policy discussions in terms of what hold on and I have I know frree but I but I agree hold on I know Fred but to say how much he disagree but I agree because I'll see people say things they'll be like they'll be so [ __ ] every time Charlamagne says something about politics it Trends and people will be so [ __ ] mad to be black people talking about oh why is he the person people listening to why are they going there and why they for this reason this is what you're watching watching you're talking about it it's trending people go and watch The Breakfast Club the reality is they go and watch The Breakfast Club and whatever and Sh them these Outlets more than than our stuff people will be like why they will criticize The Breakfast Club I've seen this this discussion recently The Breakfast Club will have on every damn Republican candidate they have and no one they will have no problem with that the black people in the comments watching that talking about they like Larry Elder oh he cooking all this foolishness then the minute the Democrats go up there they'll be like why are the Democrats going on places like this this where they think that the black community gets their new and Y yada y I'm saying that's not what I'm saying I'm not I don't have an issue if you going on The Breakfast Club I think that you have to meet people where they are right that's been my argument like make the Tik toks put out the content so on and so forth but what we're doing is cuz you said she was speaking of policies but she doing policy and Pander and that's it should be hash policy and pandarin right and I'm tired of the pandarin because the reality of it is is you can go to The Breakfast Club and really get to the nitty and gritty of things right really talk about the meat of what you're trying to accomplish what you haven't accomplished what you want to accomplish so so forth but look at the numbers on like and this is is genuine right I have a Breakfast Club interview look at the numbers when people go and they go and talk about the meat and the seriousness in the policy on the on The Breakfast Club versus when they go and talk about foolishness or if they go say something people go and they flock to foolish that is true I like whether because of the algorithm or engagement or outrage or whatever's happening to you but people watch [ __ ] when it's that and I think that's actually a lot of that's a whole different conversation on how we be and messaging and stuff and y y but people don't I think the Democrats are not doing it right in terms of trying to figure out how to meet that that middle can can I just quickly say can I just quickly say I I make a variety of content the [ __ ] that gets reposted I remember I went I went completely ballistic on Lil booy because he was blaming KLA Harris for uh Britney grinder being in in in in Russia and it's like what is she supposed to do about that you know this is an adversary blah BL blah that was reposted everywhere do you know how many videos I've made on policy where I've talked about black maternal health I made a whole video that was 10 minutes talking about a misunderstanding or a person who misinterpreted some things around mortgages and interest rates and fees and that [ __ ] doesn't go viral it's when I'm acting like a maniac and I'm cussing [ __ ] this that's going to be reposted out of all the things that I do that's just the nature of the system I could have said a million things in a in in an hourong interview what's going to get posted is if I say [ __ ] that's the the the system 100% brought me back to you're both 100% right what I'm saying is we have I guess I'm going back to original part of the conversation we're talking about getting people on The Fringe though right so if you talking about oh how to keep people engaged who's either a already voting for the Democratic party or B don't really care that's a different conversation if you're just trying to be popular but if you were trying to get people who are leftist or people who are you know focused on Gaza or all these different things right now then you actually really do need to be leaning more into what you have accomplished because realistically you're going to get your 90 some odd per and you being on the shade room or not being on the shade room is not really going to change that 90 something percent but what is going to change something is when I go and I'm talking to people let's say who are you know who V who view themselves as leftists let's say there are people who view themselves as leftist and they think that the most left you can go is actually heading back towards the right and some instances because you know that's how certain yeah they go so left they right that happens at times and when that happens [ __ ] want to hear policy can I ask a question is there a policy that you are happy to have seen implemented at any point over the past almost four years me personally personally I'll give you I'll give you a really good example I think recently Biden actually doing what he can to cancel certain student loans right like he has he has gone around the system and figured out ways for people who have um who are under saved to get student loans cancelled right great cool how are you actually promoting that how's that getting out of out there right like how are people find out about that in in the community so on and so forth because all I hear from people is he promised he was going to do this he couldn't do that so even if you don't know that he couldn't do it because of the Supreme Court what you should know is that he did something yes which which is why I think rather but when you say this people go but we shouldn't have to do it the Democrats should be doing it but I don't care to me it's like it's not about the rats it's about me and us and and what we do this is my original what are how do we better get our get these things to them how do we find a way to make the medium of how we get all the policy discussions that people are not inclined to click on or they might think is boring how do we package that in a way to people that feeds their kind of entertainment World which is why like I was saying ear I I have a Eric Adams doc on my page that has like almost 200,000 views that people watch because I realized you y'all will get into my hate Eric Adams if I say [ __ ] this person because everybody's a hater you know what I mean so I can get you all this information and packages to you and this entertaining way around hating this person so when I realized that I'm like I talk about Eric Adams all the time I have other videos on my my page about Eric Adams but it wasn't couched as hey here's a here's a documentary about hating this guy so now I realized like I just finished writing and I'm going to record it after I finish talking to y'all um the Greg Abbot equivalent so I was like you know what how do we get all this stuff about Texas and all these things that if I tried to have as a hairs a policy stuff about Texas and that that be like I'm [ __ ] bored but if I couch it and oh I hate C so I'm like okay that's the way I think I can go about doing this across the country all these politicians I can do this I can make this entertaining and feed to this how we do it and I think that's why I'm wondering if we need to start switching the conversation to what from what the Democrats aren't doing and what da D to how do we better we be better effective Messengers how do we meet people like where they're at not just where they're at these mediums but how they want to be met you know what I mean like speaking to them in a way that they are interested in that that's yes yes I I always come after you when I have a slight disagree everything you said absolutely agree with but but here's the thing though I think we'd have to add to it I think we have to also stop caring about the sensitivity and the feelings of some of the people we have to talk to especially when they have bought into ideas that are just stupid and just dumb and there's really no other way to explain it there's there's no kind of policy way to help some understand that you bought into antiva messaging you bought into now you think masks don't work no that's just stupid right like that that's not there's no grounding there or when you you know you have people who want to support Donald Trump for specific reasons if if we continue to give amount of credibility or Credence or just allow people to have this space where we don't go after their space the way they come after ours you have to understand we give these people the benefit of the doubt you you can't be uncivil to people who are antib backs you can't be uncivil to people who are voting for Donald Trump you have to sit there and have an engage in their debates and all of their bigotry why why should we do that if you want entertainment I think the first thing that we should do is take the people who are doing the things that are outright ignorant and stupid and tell them listen the reason they don't want you to wear a mask is because they can't see you and use facial recognition technology and you believe them dummy that's I think that's all we can do these days can I say two things um to Fred's point and to your point la like the save plan that was something I talked about on my show um and I had callers I have a live call in radio show that called in one person $300,000 student loan debt cancel this is just a this is a Saturday 3 p p.m. I that people don't know what I'm going to talk about in advance one person $100,000 student loan cancelled because of the Biden Administration and I made a video on um posted on social media I had a lot of people oh I'm going to go sign up as a result of this should I got paid for that hell yeah I should have got paid cuz I'm advertising it you know but the reality is to Fred's Point only at the time it was like six million people had signed up for it out of 30 something million people eligible so there's a messaging Gap and there's an information Gap but to your point Olay about you know hate sales I'm rephrasing it but when I'm when I'm making a video it depends on my audience you know there's some videos where I'm like all right if I'm like [ __ ] that they tuning out they don't want to hear that you know what I'm and in some videos that's that's the energy that I'm going to give even though it may not seem like I'm being strategic I try to be cognizant of who is my target audience for this particular message that I'm trying to get out and I try to make sure that I'm bringing them in in the tone and in the messaging that's going to resonate with them sometimes to Ben's point you got to you know clap back and you gota you can't be civil with it but there are times particularly when we're talking to our people that you might have to be a little delicate you might have to watch maybe some of what you're going to say and how you say it because you're not trying to alienate those people that are getable the key is if they're getable people then you might make slight adjustments yeah yeah yeah yeah whether you want them to vote yeah we had a moment we had a moment of silence we had a mute and I messed it up yeah yeah yeah everybody on mute m b was ready no it's all good go ahead on we've been here for a good no this is beautiful I I feel like we finally we got the some semblance of G gabbles like we WRA up oh no this is great we've got to do this again yes no we should do this again these conversations are going to be very necessary in this time leading up uh you know to to the election so this is why we we got to do what we need to do some they got boots on the ground in the street right but we can use our platforms to be those boots on the ground in these virtual streets and I didn't want to end this video without y'all recognizing that Benjamin Charles and Frederick are dress alike something about that Marvin Gay beanie I don't know what it is October London it's the there's gonna be an oped on beating Bros sometime coming something going on he's going to talk about how I was like oh so are y'all all bald and he was like no it ain't even li can't go like that oh I just want to say though I also think that this is important because I all of us have to acknowledge and I think this conversation between us we don't all have the exact same politic but we all have the exact same goals right we all have we all work the same for the black community I think one of the things that's beautiful about this that really hurt me in 2020 is I feel like there was so much tribalism around these white candidates that people started fracturing the black community um all we really have is ourselves so this conversation is import right that's why even even when there was plenty of things with Reese I'm like oh yeah I agree I'm not I'm not a comma um supporter but I definitely agree what you just said here I agree what you said there I agree with this I agree with that because that's important right because at the end of the day um you a sister at the end of the day uh Benjamin's a brother Charles is a brother Rebecca's a sister you a sister o so we need to even if we don't agree on everything our our our strategic goal is to move our community forward yeah c can I say to your point I think when we talk specifics when we talk policy I think we'll realize we're not even though we might have different rhetorical strategies or we might have different priorities that we talk about in terms of on on a on a theoretical level when we talk policy there usually isn't that much daylight between us so I hope that the next conversation each of us kind of talking about the policies that matter I think that would be very educational for people because when you get into the receipts and the specifics I think that that is so uh Illuminating for people and I think that's empowering to people to know what's happening and if something's not happening all right maybe one of us knows uh legislation to your point Olay earlier that's being proposed or a number of things so I I want us to have more of these conversations but I want to include more policy as well oh so what you're saying is you're going to be on o and friends again thank you re I love I love hearing you that on thank you recorded on the recorded line [Music]
