listen there is zero doubt in my mind that 
the Law and Order check is nothing to play   with so I have excused I have over looked I 
have been generous to iced tea not having his   mind quite right over the years but the man 
has to answer for his crimes because there   is absolutely no way I blinked my eye and 
he declared the police the mayor of hip-hop I know he [ __ ] lying and rock nation, you will 
crumble. if you don't know who Eric Adams is by   now you've been blessed but that changes now Eric 
Adams is the mayor of New York City or otherwise   known affectionately to the people on the streets 
as 5-0 yet recently iced tea honored Eric Adams as   the hip-hop mayor of New York City which is [ __ ] 
crazy so I tweeted it really breaks my heart how   uninformed some members of our community are to 
honor Eric Adams he's openly attacked drill music   and tried to blame it for Crime re-establish 
gang databases and violent NYPD squads that   brutalize black people and he's presided over 21 
deaths in Rikers Etc and I do mean Etc which most   people agree with because Eric Adams is a mayor 
who's been pulling poorly for quite some time now   but for those who didn't who might just think 
I'm a hater you're right I am but I am a hater   with lots and lots of reasons so today I'm going 
to give you the pertinent ones Eric Adams is not   only not the hip top mayor of New York City but 
he's also the copiest cop to ever do it he is   so much a cop in fact that even NYPD had to say 
hey [ __ ] you might want to chill a little bit   Eric Adams assumed office on January 1st 2022. 
on January 18th that's just a little bit over   two weeks later a 16 year old teenage rapper in 
the Bronx that goes by C blue was arrested he was   arrested and accused of shooting an NYPD officer 
they set 250 000 bail on this teenage boy and he   posted it he posted a quarter of a million dollars 
using Eric Adams beloved cash bail system and yet   child Eric Adams was aghast he he said New Yorkers 
should be outraged that this teenage child is free   to roam the streets meanwhile all that outrage 
and NYPD lied turns out the officers illegally   approached the boy illegally questioned the boy 
illegally detained the boy illegally assaulted   the boy causing the gun in his pocket to go off 
and shoot him through his leg and through the   officer's leg according to the New York daily 
news the Bronx judge hearing the case ruled   that Williams thats C blue should be charged 
as a juvenile which by the way is a word the   criminal system uses intentionally so that we 
dehumanize children and don't realize they're   being criminalized so we should remove that out 
of our lexicon but nonetheless it's a good thing   that she wanted him charged this way so she ruled 
that he should be charged as a juvenile and she   also slammed time the officers for what she called 
incredible and unreliable testimony that had quote   no value because despite officers claims that C
blue was a part of a disorderly crowd that   refused to comply with the police's orders or 
to take his hands out of his pocket which led   to a scrap between him and the officer after she 
reviewed the video footage the judge found and   these are her words not mine that not only did the 
officers have no apparent reason to have initiated   the confrontation with him in the first place but 
once they did approach him they detained him they   searched him and no officer even bothered to 
come up with a halfway legitimate reason for   any of that and she said while there is no 
disputing the fact that Mr Williams that C   blue had a gun on him that night he literally 
does everything you tell your child to do when   they're approached by cops he literally kept his 
hands up he literally tried to record to make sure   there was proof he answered the questions he had 
no obligation to answer and clear video foootage   shown in court proves he tried to cooperate 
with the police was illegally searched and   the gun went off as the officers grabbed his side 
the judge's words not mine upon learning this new   information did Eric Adams apologize to C blue did 
he take it back did he walk it back did he decide   to lean up off him or maybe the other teenage 
rappers engaging in drill music no no he did not   but that's actually Eric Adams M-O in May of 2022 
NYPD shot and killed a young black man 25 year old   Ramik Smith and Eric Adams hailed and praised the 
officers for killing who he described as a career   criminal Eric Adams sat there and let tears well 
in his eyes as he applauded The Bravery of these   officers who claimed that ramik had shot at them 
giving them no other choice but to shoot at him   and kill him body cam footage eventually revealed 
that not only had ramik not shot at them he was   running away when officers shot him twice in the 
back of his head did Eric Adams apologize no but   back to his war on drill music on February 11 2022 
so that's just a little over a month after Eric   Adams assumed office as mayor of New York City 
he formally declared war on drill music Rolling   Stone reported Adams expressed concern about drill 
rap the musical sub-genre that is flourish in his   home borough of Brooklyn over the past half decade 
five years you see how they have to add some drama   to it five years he characterized the music as 
alarming linking it to gun violence and appeared   to put further blame on social media companies 
you know I mean we pulled a trump off Twitter   because of what he was spewing yet we are allowing 
music displaying of guns violence we're allowing   it to stay on these sites Adams acknowledged that 
his concern about drill rap is relatively recent   quote I had no idea what drill rapping was but 
I called my son and he sent me some videos and   it is alarming he said imagine imagine you don't 
even know what drill music is you just heard about   it but you just know that's that's the reason we 
have crime right he just heard about the music but   that is the reason for ongoing crime and one of 
the most expensive cities in the world right it's   drill music round them up boys get them NYPD so 
he called his son and he said we are going to pull   together the social media companies and sit down 
with them and tell them that you have a Civic and   corporate responsibility Rolling Stone comments 
Adam's remarks are in line with anti-rap messaging   from police and prosecutors across the country 
which has been decried by artists legal Scholars   and Free Speech advocates but the mayor's distaste 
for drill music goes further than what his own   police force says just ask NYPD Chief Joseph 
gulado who recently told the New York daily news   that it's a mistake to blame the music for several 
recent shootings involving Brooklyn rappers these   are gang shootings you know what they differ on is 
where to land their conspiracy I think sometimes   rapping the lyrics ignites caused some issues 
but I don't think that's the underlying motive   at the end of the day do you know how much Nimble 
gymnastics you have to be doing to find another   reason and excuse to criminalize black boys and 
men for NYPD to say I don't think I could sign   on to that wholeheartedly bruh but again this 
is all incredibly consistent with Eric Adams   overall agenda that agenda being to find new 
ways to criminalize black people and to expand   nypd's reach because one of the very first things 
that Eric Adams did when he assumed office was to   re-establish an NYPD unit that had been disbanded 
because of its rampant violent history of abuse   and when I'd say rampant when I say violence 
let me explain to you what I mean by reading   a tweet from former public defender Scott 
hessinger that really gets to the heart of   what this unit is New York City Mayor Eric 
Adams is a dangerous liar the Elite Police   Unit that he reviewed was responsible for nearly 
one-third of all police murders over a 20-year   period despite making up only five percent of 
the police force they killed Eric Garner and   they wore body cameras and they were caught on 
camera is this your king is this your king Ice T   in conclusion Ice T is the conch 
shell of the week and [_] the police did you all know that mad koalas have chlamydia 
like yeah bro koalas Ultra down bad in the wild
