They Said they were in contact with you. It would be great to have you guys discuss and refute Russell Dobular:s concept of how we in the working class would not be able to create a better society and just waste our lives getting drunk, or drug addicted once we had control of the means of production because everyone would somehow become idle, and not work towards a better society. This was discussed on their latest episode of DUE DISSIDENCE on Friday. Other people in the chat were also suggesting they get ahold of you guys at Midwestern Marx... I think it would make for a great show and give all of you more exposure to others.",

        "text": "@jachymsebes During the Cold War, France was known to have supported several military dictatorships, particularly in its former colonies. Some of the notable examples include:\n\n1. **Chad**: France supported the government of Hissène Habré, who took power in 1982. Habré's regime was known for its harsh crackdowns on dissent and widespread human rights abuses.\n\n2. **Gabon**: France had a close relationship with Omar Bongo, who ruled Gabon from 1967 until his death in 2009. While not a military dictatorship in the strictest sense, Bongo's regime was authoritarian and benefited from French support.\n\n3. **Central African Republic**: France supported Jean-Bédel Bokassa, who seized power in 1966 and declared himself emperor in 1976. Bokassa's regime was notorious for its brutality and lavish excesses.\n\n4. **Zaire (now the Democratic Republic of Congo)**: While primarily supported by the United States, Mobutu Sese Seko's regime also received backing from France. Mobutu led a repressive regime from 1965 to 1997.\n\n5. **Rwanda**: Prior to the 1994 genocide, France was a key supporter of Juvénal Habyarimana's regime, which was characterized by ethnic tensions and authoritarian rule.\n\n6. **Algeria**: During the Algerian War (1954-1962), France itself was the terrorist regime or at least used methods you would probably deem terroristic to keep in power.\n\nFrance has also been accused of supporting groups that some people and governments would describe as terrorists. This involvement was often part of a broader geopolitical strategy or in pursuit of national interests. Here are a few examples:\n\n1. **Support for Algerian Militias**: During the Algerian War of Independence (1954-1962), France supported certain armed groups, like the \"harkis,\" Algerian Muslims who fought against the Algerian National Liberation Front (FLN). The FLN itself was considered a terrorist organization by France during the war, but these perceptions changed after Algeria gained independence.\n\n2. **Involvement in African Conflicts**: France has been involved in numerous conflicts in Africa, sometimes supporting groups that were involved in activities that could be considered terrorist. This includes their involvement in countries like Chad, the Central African Republic, and others where the line between state actors, rebels, and terrorist groups can be blurred.\n\n3. **Support for Anti-Communist Groups**: During the Cold War, like the United States and other Western nations, France sometimes supported anti-communist militias or groups in various countries. Some of these groups were involved in acts that could be classified as terrorism. One example would be be the involvement of France and other NATO-States in the Portuguese colonial war (1961-1972). \n\n4. **Involvement in the Syrian Civil War**: More recently, France, along with other Western nations, supported certain rebel groups in Syria against the Assad regime. Some of these groups had links to or were later associated with jihadist elements, though France's support was primarily aimed at moderate factions, though the Syrian government deemed all of them terrorist.\n\n5. **Operation Turquoise in Rwanda**: In 1994, during the Rwandan genocide, France launched a military operation known as Operation Turquoise. While the official aim was humanitarian, there have been accusations that the operation indirectly supported the Hutu extremists responsible for the genocide.",
