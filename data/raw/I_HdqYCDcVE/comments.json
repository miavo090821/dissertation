Have to apologize since I made a blunder here. \nWhile a member state can theoretically use his seat in the commission to \"prevent laws\" that they view as detrimental to them, that job really lies more with the Council since the commission is supposed to act in the common european interest. In addition to that, laws are send to national parliaments and they can reject them aswell, if they think it violates the principle of subsidiarity.

There is literally no reason at all for multinational company to sell products in UK just because they are not part of EU.\n\n\"However, the EU has a lot more punching power and even the largest multinational companies can't afford loosing the entire Single Market. \"\nMy previous point applies here. You do realize that EU actually makes it less attractive to trade with any country that is part of EU? That is due regulations and tariffs that EU places on any country that tries to trade with EU.\n\n\"That is why the EU has the ability of achieving things that the UK on its own can't. \"\nLike what? Hong Kong achieves lot of things without being part of EU. So does Singapore, Norway, Switzerland, New Zealand, Australia, USA etc...\n\nI also love how you ignore article 11 and 13.

        "text": "The Lords is completely different to the eu. The House of Lords is a ceremonial body - it pretty much has 0 power. It used to be that the House of Lords was the highest court, but since the introduction of the Supreme Court it no longer serves this function. Iirc, its only tangible power is that it can delay legislation. Anyway, nowadays there are few hereditary peers - who are themselves elected by peers of their party, as well as 15 who are elected by the whole house to serve in various ceremonial roles. Collectively the Lords fulfil a mostly advisory role with the Lords being drawn from people who are esteemed or esteemed in their field, as well as of course the Lords Spiritual drawn from the CoE. \n\nTo be clear, I couldn't care less about democracy, its proven itself to be a totally redundant means of governing a nation at least - it would probably go a lot further in other areas of (local) political organisation for instance labour organising, some form of workplace democracy, as well as in electing Councillors etc. My qualm with the EU is it undermines the sovereignty of parliament, means laws can be passed without the many layers of scrutiny from the house of commons, and places power into the hands of bureaucrats overseas who see our nation as nothing more than something to bolster the EU economy and subsidise their various programs.\n\nIts utterly astounding to me that people who would otherwise piss on Thatchers grave come out in support of EU politicians like Slimy Guy Verhofstadt who is himself, in essence, cut from the same cloth.",

There is no utility in the monarchy and the aristocracy as it stands in terms of their executive privileges, which is why materialists patently reject it. This is not convincing.

        "text": "I fail to see what point this comment is trying to make. We're past the days of colonialism (neo-colonialism is a separate issue, we're not talking about that here) and there are very few that actually advocate for the re-colonisation of former colonies. The UK isn't currently participating in a military occupation of territory where they're unwanted and exploiting the land of its wealth and resources. The UK has overseas territories, sure, but the UK has probably given one of the best examples of respecting the right to self-determination with the allowance of the Scottish, Gibraltarian, and Falkland referendums. You could argue they haven't been perfect, but the UK is certainly better at it than most. Not to mention that the UK has expressed clear willingness to allow Northern Ireland to join the Republic if they so choose (in a referendum). Compare that to Spain which brutally suppressed the Catalans when they went out to vote. Or the ethnic cleansing of Kurds by Turkey, Iraq, Syria, and Iran. Or what about Azerbaijan's treatment of Artsakh? Don't even get me started on Kashmir, Tibet, or Xinjiang. \n\nIf you want to make the case that Brexiteers exaggerate the negatives of the EU (calling it the fourth reich or whatever other stupid shit) then I think that's a pretty valid one. But how does this tie into the Empire? Most people weren't around during the height of the empire, and those who were alive to witness it were ultimately living through it's downfall. This post assumes that every person that claims that the EU is bad for Britain on the argument of national sovereignty are the same people who advocated for preventing the colonies from declaring independence. \n\nIf we're going to make stupid arguments I could very easily say 'hurr durr this isn't the first time the UK intentionally ruined their own economy to save Europe hurr durr muh WW2'. This attitude that leave voters are all harking back to the glory days of Pax Britannica are the same purely emotive arguments you accuse leave voters of peddling.",

I think political comedy is much more open to criticism than other forms, because comedy in general does a good job to mould social climate, culture and perception. When politics are thrown into the mix, hoooo boy. Political comedy very often has a person's real opinions sprinkled in, and political comedy in general tend to have a pretty strong influence over people's real opinions as well (I doubt you find right-wing political comedy funny, because you very likely don't agree with the opinions the jokes are based on). Your example of a joke was a rather weak comparison because it's not making a statement of any substance. Not to mention that many would dispute the characterisation as a 'joke' as very few find jokes like that funny. \n\nComedy forms opinions. And I think you'll find that the implications expressed by this joke are very widely held, unironic beliefs. Beliefs that do very little but sow socio-political tribalism. A lot of political comedy these days is based on the demonisation of those who think differently. Is this not a valid reason to criticise? \n\nI think it's safe for me to assume that you don't hold many positive opinions of the UK as a country. Could be wrong, if I am I apologise. As i said, just an assumption. But if that is the case; I don't blame you for that, but does that not influence your enjoyment of the humour?",

She is heavily published and has held high ranking positions at a few universities, including Rutgers and Stanford. A friend of mine is a dietiican that works in oncology, she has a literal alphabet soup after her name, many people would think that is successful, she earns less than my cousin.\nI also know trust fund babies that get hand written condolence letters from the Bush family that are nice people, but they never worked for anything.  I know a mafia family heiress, is that successful?",

I know that this isn't true for them (my Grandma Payne is Scottish and does not really have any proud beard to speak of--or if she does she shaves it)--but that image is still their chief national export and not really much else of major amount. It results in a smaller population, and less stuff to use in the community chest.\n\nHowever, they are still part of a community--and are still part of people. Do these people deserve less simply because they live in a more sparser populated region? Not me arguing because I still have that ridiculous image in my head of the proud Scottish Men and Women with their burly muscles and flowing beards... and do not wish to upset them... but simply because they are people... and deserve some proper respect... and prolly less of me making some of the fine Scottish Ladies feel self conscious about their long flowing chin mane not being as good as the standards of beauty presents (those models totally have extensions in)--and yes.. they can crush plenty of boulders with their biceps, so not to feel self conscious.\n\nWhich... is just an element of how this whole matter has nuance that most Brexit supports really do not care about--because they wish to still believe that \"England Prevails\" and that the Empire is still as strong as ever!",

Germany has created an artificially insulated market within the EU and Eurozone, they have no choice but to trade with everyone - exporters are always more vulnerable than importers.

Indeed, the first two colleges I thought of, BC and Bard College, both have graduate degree programs.\n\nThat aside, if we look at just the colloquial usages, I think it is correct to say that the US uses \"college\" where the UK uses \"university\" (or just \"uni.\")  For instance, this conversation might take place in the US:\n\nAnn: Barbara, are you going to college this year?\nBarbara: I sure am, and I'm really looking forward to it!\nA: What college are you going to?\nB: Boston University.\n\nIn the UK, the word \"college\" in Ann's dialogue would be replaced with the word \"university\" even if the school to be attended were BC rather than BU.",

I merely posit that as with anything in life and especially politics, it is relative to the context of the subject, not some blanket stance to be washed over everything.\n\nYes there is always a chance my perspective is wrong, but putting aside my educational qualifications, seeing as the most educated group of people align with my perspective, I think the chance is far more slim. The Brexiters are in majority on file to be old/traditionalists (demonstrating lack of progressive mindset), lacking higher education (ignorant to many perspectives and not exercised in critical thinking skills) and low income (a.k.a the perfect group to be fearmongered into finding a scapegoat for their problems of low success/status). Aside from outliers this is generally the 'leave voter' profile as presented by any data/poll looking into the referendum.  \n\nThe exceptions to this profile are the billionaires profiting off misguiding this group, in buying lowered shares among other profitable ventures from Brexit and even jumping ship themselves temporarily because they can see the storm a mile off.\n\nSo yes, it is possible the remain perspective is wrong, but do I think it's likely? No, not in the slightest.\n\nPlus, I don't need to justify why I choose to stay and try to work towards a better future for my country to someone who has made it very clear they would rather leave the UK if they ever disagreed with it.

The word you're looking for is, \"censorship\" and even that is arguably correct in some cases, as with anything it cannot be a blanket Yes or No. The irony is, Free Speech, Expression and Conscience is a hallmark of multi-cultralism, and the ideas supporting such structures. For example, Liberalism, which\r\nadvocates Free Market, Free Speech and Secular Government among other things. Besides, I would think the group trying to not push others out and isolate ourselves into our own bubble are far more open to hearing what others have to say and feel, a la free speech and expression, no?\r\n\r\nThe were behind the EU indeed, but not in the fashion you are trying to portray. The EU was created as a bastion against the very ideals the Nazis held. It is not an extension of, but a response to the Nazi ideologue that a united front of different peoples, ideas and cultural backgrounds oppose and abhor their authoritarian and savage style of society.\r\n\r\nThe free market of trade and ideas in a group dedicated to upholding civil rights tenants (whether poorly or well depending on which country you focus on) would be the bane of Nazi existence, as their rule was all about enforcing their own nationalistic and xenophobic ideas on every country they could get their hands on. The more extreme but of the same ilk of nationalism we see today in a large part of the 'leave movement' in the UK. I don't know about you, but older angry white men who dislike ideas of cultural diversity strike me as far closer to the Nazi Aryan obsession than the opposition.\r\n\r\nRegardless of all of the poor outcomes economically and politically demonstrated by this very video, even symbolically the EU stands as a big middle finger against what was the Nazis, and the mental gymnastics one has to pull to somehow associate the very union built to prevent anything like Nazism ever appearing again, with Nazism is spectacular. What your grandfather fought for is comprised in the EU, not outside of it, my friend. Although everyone may disagree\r in some capacity with certain policies, because the EU is not infallible, veterans, including your grandfather fought for the very ideals of a united world of tolerance, acceptance and ultimately compassion for your fellow man regardless of origin, as long as the substance of their character was good. No amount of using the rule of three “I voted to leave because…” will change that, and to be honest this really gives me the impression you are voting/engaging this discussion out of emotion and not logical reasoning. That is a worrying notion to me because that is most likely the emotive stance the majority of ‘Leave’ had, and emotion is no way to decide a population’s future.\n\n\r\nDemocracy is not about locking yourself in an echo chamber of ideas so you all agree, it is about welcoming differing perspectives as long as they primary objective isn’t to harm. There is no better way to uphold democracy than to be part of the global discussion, and the UK ejecting itself from it is a good way to further itself from democracy on a global level.\r\n\r\n\r\nI highly doubt I am the type to ‘Sieg Heil’ as I would be one of the first to be dead if the Nazis had their way, on account of I am not anywhere close to their Aryan fetish race. So no. I highly doubt I am that kind of person because I believe in a world of freedom and inclusiveness. \r\n\r\nYou don’t get to decide what an ‘act of treason’ is. The ones undermining this country are those darkening it’s future by giving into fear mongering and propaganda spread by an irrational scare of the global stage. When we have to pay for huge economic strife, and a weakening NHS (arguably our greatest achievement as a country on this planet) and lackluster trade due to the fact we have lost our leverage with a large portion of trading partners with most of them not even being “on track” to a positive resolution, I can not in good faith for this country condone Brexit. That is not treason, that is the opposite.\r\n\r\nI am not even going to address that statement about higher education. If you’re really advocating we listen to those who haven’t developed critical thinking or reasoning skills and have a low understanding of complex ideas, then I can’t take you seriously, sorry. Education is not an absolute measurement of good, or intelligence, but if I was to take my chances on trusting my economy with trained economists and graduates, or your local ‘Barry’ that thinks they ‘are taking our jobs’ and has no formal education beside Alt-Right Youtube channels, I know who I would pick. Suffice to say, it would not be Barry.",

OK then you are (to quote the left) a fascist. \nFree speech, liberalism, expression and conscience have nothing to do with the religious cult of multiculturalism, as that ideology and its acolytes are in opposition to civil liberties. \nIsolate ourselves? It is the EUSR which is isolated - hence the tarriffs. The left/Islam/Remoan/SJWs/EFF/BLM/Feminazis/Otpor/Pora/Momentum/antifa and their sponsors and supporters are the ones trying to force their views upon others and are intolerant of diverse opinions and positions. \n\n\nThe EU as I stated before was created by Nazis, this is for the purposes of continuing German politics through over more covert and back-handed means. Its undemocratic and anti-democratic nature is pretty obvious to many people. It is a giant melting pot that seeks to impose without question nor dissent Ein Volk, Ein Reich, Ein Europa - one mixed-race group of 'European Citizens' at the expense of the native races, cultures and identities (which ironically is racist). \n\n\nExcept the EU is just another form of communism, and is opposed to the free markets of trade and ideas. What is so free market about having regulations stating that butter mountains of food are to be dumped into 3rd World nations? I guess you must be a Soros NPC that supports globalism at everyone else's expense. Nationalism could mean anything. Cultural diversity is another word for forced segregation and anti-white racism, it is also undemocratic in this country. So what do Mexicans, Japanese and Arabs think of cultural diversity? They think it is shit. \n\n\nPoor outcomes economically and politically? Nah those are just MSM projections of fear. The EUSR is the Fourth Reich, so more of an open palm upward pointing and horizontal 'Knife Hands' than a middle finger. The cognitive dissonance and denial someone displays when they are told of the fact that Nazis created the EU is very typical of such child-like behaviour. And my grandfather would not fight for corrupt communist fascists and many like him would be turning in their graves at the direction this country has taken. What my grand-dad fought for was continued in the form of anti-communism in its most militant manifestation: NATO. And you are not my friend, so you can cut the patronizing remarks. \n\n\nIncorrect. People like my grandad fought for King, Country, their Corps/Regiment, and their Best Mate, apart from the obvious - to kill and survive. Nah, I am engaging in this debate because you are blue-pilled and I have an allergy to bollocks. No amount of using the rule of three 'I voted to remain because...' is going to change anything, the Remoaners lost and still have PMT today. Your projections of emotional instability amongst the Brexit Brigade is not working. Nice try.\n\n\nThen why does the left wing lock itself in an echo chamber and is abusive towards differing perspectives? The global discussion? That sounds more like Illuminati talk to me... Ever wondered why the French and the Dutch rejected the EU CONstitution and the Irish were forced to vote for it again and again? You know Albanians and Bosnians joined the SS? You know the Grand Mufti of Jerusalem anointed them? So you could've join the Handschar Division if you play your cards right. Sieg Heil - I use it to encourage Remoaners to just admit they hate this country or to describe their attitude and mentality. Inclusiveness - that sounds like a word used by a diversity manager-I am sorry Political Commissar. \n\n\nThe Magna Carta, Bill of Rights and R vs Thistlewood do a better job at describing treason than I do. So you admit that Project Fear is darkening all hope for this country? Awesome! The greatest achievement in this country is the Royal Navy. Get it right. South Korea is our biggest trading partner and Trump wants a major business deal with us the minute we get out. Heath took us into the EUSR on lies, and Bliar signed the EU CONstitution in violation of ours. If that ain't treason I don't know what is. But it pays to have a PM who is not a Europhile nor a sex offender. \n\n\nWell you claim to be educated but KGB officer Yuri Bezmenov says otherwise. The KGB used infiltration and deception tactics to undermine the family, society and school system. Acolytes of the Frankfurt School laid the foundations of this subversion. So you admit you will be programmed to support 'expert's who get Brussels bribe money and activists with a higher level of 'education' that teaches the youth what to think instead of how to think. You would make a great spokesman for the Communist Fascist Party!",

        "text": "@Spunjji I said that Three Arrows was wrong to begin with the assumption that people voted to leave because of some vague idea of sovereignty, which was the thrust of the video he showed of Farage.  People who voted to leave did so for many reasons, so, if Three Arrows wishes to portray himself as a speaker of the truth, he should have widened his sources. You are right to say that Scotland and N. Ireland voted to remain, however, this is not how a national referendum works, as you well know.  A UK-wide referendum has to take each vote as equal to another and the majority of the people who voted in the UK voted to leave.  The reasons for leaving are many, as are the reasons for remaining.  However, the question on the ballot paper was to leave or to remain and people made their choice.  We haven't left the EU because MPs from all parties and from both the leave and remain sides are pursuing their own political agendas, most of which have nothing to do with Brexit.  It is not because they can't agree on what 'type' of Brexit we should have - most MPs are remainers, so they will never agree to any plan if it involves leaving the EU.  In addition, the Labour Party seeks only one outcome - that of a General Election - and will do everything it can to achieve that goal.  In short, all sides are playing games with the future of this country.  There is a tendency to mock the people who voted to leave, as if they are not intelligent enough or wealthy enough, or young enough,  to understand what they voted for.  This is wrong and plays into the hands of the politicians who seek to manipulate the result of the referendum.  We cannot live in a country that picks and chooses its democratic processes and outcomes.  If we do so, no election results in the future will be considered valid - after all, which political party ever upheld the promises it made in its election manifesto?  We are ALWAYS lied to, but sometimes we have to bite the bullet and accept that, in spite of its faults, our system is the only one we have.",

Your following post is one hell of a gish gallop - there is no reasonable way I can respond to every point you made, which has allowed you to hide a bunch of defective arguments, generalisations and outright falsehoods. Let's stick to the facts: we had an *advisory* referendum during which the Leave campaign committed several acts of election fraud to finance its disinformation. Leave won, and the government immediately insisted that the referendum be binding without presenting any logical argument why that should be the case. The people negotiating Brexit are representatives of the Leave campaign and yet they have created a plan so comprehensively terrible that it cannot get even a majority of Leave supporters behind it, let alone the rest of the country. Three Arrows is at no point condescending to Leave voters, but he does point out contradictions in the claims of its most vocal proponents. If that makes you feel attacked, you would be better off examining why than accusing everyone else of being mean to you.",

You choose to ignore the history of the Ottoman Empire, the Nazis, the Communists in the USSR, the Chinese slaughter of the Japanese people etc. etc.  No nation's history is completely void of the maltreatment of others.
