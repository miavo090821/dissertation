Every single year we took a standardized history test we were told this was the right answer. It wasn't until college I even heard about the lost cause of the south and basically had to relearn the civil war chapters of history. It's insidious and doesn't surprise me that so many southerners really believe that when it's literally fed to us through out state mandated curriculum",

The Civil War didn't start over the abolition of slavery, but it certainly ended up being about it. Also, the North did capitalize on emphasizing the role of abolishing slavery in the war to European nations, mostly Russia.",

Algore, perhaps?  Grampa Badfinger?\n\r\nJefferson Davis' farewell address doesn't mention \"a rise in abolitionist sentiment' in the slightest--which makes sense, since even in the North abolitionists were a tiny, despised minority.  He did complain about attempts to rile up bloody slave revolts (which, as he noted, was also in the US Declaration of Independence).  Jefferson Davis on other occasions spoke of the fact that slavery was doomed whether the Confederacy won the war or not, and stated during the war that we were not fighting for slavery but independence, but somehow the direct statements don't make it into any calculations.\r\n\r\nIt's amusing that the Daughters of the Confederacy have apparently become some diabolical Dixie Illuminati--a Dixienati?--that controls history, but they were basically a group of rape victims who sought to set the record straight.    Rather than knit blankets and talk about how nice slavery was, the UDC held burials and build memorials.  Amusingly, their commitment to immortalizing the heroism of Confederate women was more than any northerner was willing to credit the fairer sex with. \r\n\r\nIt's also amusing that the 'Peaceful Protesters' have attacked the UDC headquarters...  but every office of the Sons of Confederate Veterans, an all-male organization, and the League of the South, a mostly-male organization, haven't seen any attacks.  Looks like some things never change.....\r\n\r\n\"Now you can tell me that's nonsense or call me a dumb yankee, which seems to be your MO, \"\r\nThat really depends on your posts. You're wrong, but if you don't go around accusing me of supporting genocide, or consider \"lying buffoon\" to be an argument--not just worthy of using but defending as well--or toss around race-card bullshit, you're pretty safe.  (all those from this thread, btw.)\r\n\r\nWhenever I referred to someone's argument as nonsense, I also took care to explain exactly why it was.  \r\n\r\nSo it's interesting that you've already decided you'll get such a response--the guilty flee when no man pursueth?--but the simple fact remains that states' rights, the proper role of the federal government, and the use of government to manage the economy had been big issues in American politics since long, long before the Southern states exercised our constitutional right to secede.  It had gone on...  well, really, with the colonists vs King George (the Dutch East India Company had been given an exclusive monopoly on tea in the colonies, which they knew would cost them a lot more than a measly 3% tax, which is exactly why the Boston Tea Party took place), but it continued with the Federalists vs the Antifederalists, with Clay vs Calhoun, and then Lincoln vs. Davis.  \r\n\r\nSlavery was secure.  Not only did Lincoln and congress make clear they wouldn't do anything about it, but it was held as Constitutional (that's why we needed an amendment to change it, after all).  Abolitionists were a tiny, despised minority that politicians--including Lincoln himself--distanced himself from.  Slavery was more secure in the Union than it was out of it (a fact that Alexander Stephens acknowledged in a non-disputed quote, that somehow doesn't get so much notice).\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the 1824 tariff caused an economic boom in the Northeast....  and in South Carolina, exports fell by 25%.

Aeneas's writings are still known, whereas many ruins are lost.\n\nOn your point of the Egyptians: the Rosetta Stone was extremely helpful in translating the language. Had we lacked any record of communication between Egyptians and Greeks, translating would have been harder. However, language analysis exists on languages we haven't fully translated or understood simply because of patterns common among languages that exist in writing. \n\nTo claim I am \"a truly evil person\" is simply rude; you've not met me, nor do you understand my motivations. I don't seek to destroy things, as I agree with preserving historical structures and monuments. However, those monuments aren't always appropriate for a public space. \n\nBooks are able to contextualize things, cites sources, and give a view on the events described, whether or not the depiction is accurate. Statues do not provide context. \n\nTo make things abstract for a moment, imagine a person with a full understanding of the English language and no understanding of history. What do you think a statue of Jefferson Davis says to them? If it is publicly displayed, that implies they are worthy of some form of honor. The Constitution of the Confederacy grants much more context as to why the Confederate States came to be than the structures made decades after their time.\n\nFor the record, a mention of Hitler in an argument is not called reductum ad hitlerum, but Godwin's Law. You would also be using the wrong Latin gender suffix and case for Hitler.",

He was, in many war historian's opinion, one of if not the best military mind of the Civil War. He was at least a major reason why the rebellion lasted as long as it did, and played a key role in many battles. Yet, Longstreet is not talked about among neoconfederates, and it's easy to see why. After the war, he largely reversed his position that the Civil War was justified and accepted defeat, basically admitting the whole thing was a mistake. Many southern (hate) groups throughout history openly talked about how he should not be memorialized because he was inconvenient to their Lost Cause narrative. \n\nAnd to me that's all the proof you need that these statues are not memorializing history (whatever that means) or memorializing the great military minds and personalities in the war, because if that were the case, he would have just as many, if not more, statues and memorials than someone like Stonewall Jackson. It was all about racial and societal ideology at the time, trying to rewrite history.",

        "text": "Stuart has a rather large statue in Richmond, and the only mar on his legacy is that he made a real mistake during Gettysburg (something Lee forced the Confederates into even though it was a stupid idea). Longstreet in reality made no big mistakes, and Confederate-friendly historians made up stuff about him to tar his legacy, and to this day there's almost no statues or commemorations of him outside his hometown. This is undoubtedly because he supported the Republican Party after the war and supported the freedom of blacks:\n\n\"Authors espousing the Lost Cause attacked Longstreet's war career for many years after his death. Modern authors trace that criticism to Longstreet's acceptance of the defeat and accommodations both with the Republican party and freed blacks. The attacks formally began on January 19, 1872, the anniversary of Lee's birth and less than two years after Lee died. Jubal Early, in a speech at Washington College, exonerated Lee for the defeat at Gettysburg and falsely accused Longstreet of having attacked late on the second day and of being responsible for the debacle on the third. The following year, William N. Pendleton, Lee's artillery chief, claimed in the same venue that Longstreet disobeyed an explicit order to attack at sunrise on July 2. Both allegations were fabrications; however, Longstreet failed to challenge them publicly until 1875. The delay damaged his reputation, as the Lost Cause mythology had now taken hold. Longstreet's former subordinate Col. John S. Mosby defended his commander, and other former Confederates who joined the Republican Party were subjected to similar criticism, including Gen. William Mahone and Robert W. Flournoy.\n\nA \"reconstructed rebel\", Longstreet embraced equal rights for blacks, unification of the nation, and Reconstruction. After Longstreet died, his widow Helen Dortch Longstreet, privately published Lee and Longstreet at High Tide in his defense and stated that \"the South was seditiously taught to believe that the Federal Victory was wholly the fortuitous outcome of the culpable disobedience of General Longstreet.\"\"\n\nI don't know why a \"tragic\" figure would be exempted from having statues made of him like all the rest. The fact is, when they were making many of these statues in the early 1900s, southerners hated Longstreet for being anti-Confederate after the war and told lies about how he disobeyed the Perfect God Lee's orders, even though Lee was the real reason they lost the war, if the war was ever winnable to begin with.",

Try doing all of that yourself, with NO assistance at all, whatsoever.\n\nTry paying for your own children to go to school right out of your own pocket. Try picking up your own trash and disposing of it in ways that wouldn't harm the environment. Try posting your erratic responses without an internet connection.\n\nAll of this is what a Social-Democratic system gives you.

        "text": "+Matthew Chenault It's obvious your understanding of economics is limited, and the simple fact you've blatantly ignored what people at the top even have said, but Trickle Down economics, or as George Bush the senior called it, Voodoo economics, is an absolute disaster and failure. In fact, those economics are the major reason that income inequality is such a big deal today, to the point that wages have raised very little while the rich have seen an explosion in income. It has also proven to help crash the economy multiple times, including the Great Recession that hit because of George HW Bush, along with the Republican stint since Reagan to remove regulations and controls that were in place specifically to protect the people of the US and keep corporate interests from preying on them. They even had a panel, publicly broadcast, where they asked corporations if they were going to bring up wages and hire more people once they get Trump's tax break, not a one of them said yes. Another has come up and said there is no incentive because why should they raise productivity when there is no demand for it?  But then again, Republicans have bought the great lie that regulations were hurting all people. Hell, the greatest lie that Republicans believed was the estate tax, or death tax as it was framed, that an estate tax on wealthy individuals also affected people who weren't wealthy.\n\nBut this is the plight of the modern US system right now. A good portion of this country refuses to educate themselves, at all. They follow banners instead of actually looking for the truth. The US is as tribalistic as ever in this time, especially when you consider that just 50 years ago, bipartisanship did exist. Now, it's so rare people think it's a fucking event and worth celebrating, well at least when it furthers the Republican goal of propping up their wealthy donors and trampling over the rights of everyone else in the process. But as long as they wave that Republican flag, the people that vote Republican will do it regardless of their own self interest.",

It was not \"developed by Socialist advocates,\" and it does not refer to \"downplaying the importance of deregulation and lowering taxes.\" It describes a policy of lowering taxes on the WEALTHY, which is the key bit you left out. More generally, it is the belief that if you lower taxes on the wealthy and increase incentives and subsidies for the wealthy, all classes of the nation will see benefit due to a \"trickle down\" effect. To make it even clearer, lowering taxes on the middle class and poor is NOT part of trickle down economics. Actual trickle down economics, which I just described, have been historically proven time and time again to not work. It leads to runaway income inequality and a massive deficit. Look no further than how the deficit exploded under Reagan. Actually...look a bit further, and you'll see Trump's tax cuts ballooning the deficit too.\n\nYou premise your argument on the government being too involved in the economy leading to monopolies. You then blame the existence of Google as a monopoly on the government being complicit and NOT being involved in the economy by not using anti-trust laws to stop them.....what?? I'm extremely confused. Was Reagan breaking up AT&T an example of the free market at work? Or overbearing government meddling?",

What is referred to as trickle down economics is the laughable idea that cutting taxes will boost economic activity so much it will actually have a net effect of making the deficit smaller. That can certainly be the case in certain absurd tax scenarios. But all empirical evidence analyzed in economics journals shows we are not in that situation. Obviously tax cuts provide a stimulating effect on GDP. So do spending increases. And both increase in the deficit. A tax cut with a proportional cut in spending does not stimulate the economy. Maybe take more than an intro macro class before you pretend to understand economics. (Yes it’s still an intro class even with calculus, my college has no calc free macro classes, for instance)",

If you have a statue of a General on the site of a battlefield, I am ok with that. But imagine being a white southerner and being told, “You’re tax dollars will be partially spent to erect and maintain a statue of William Sherman on a horse, on a pedestal, in front of the courthouse of this town that was burned in his March to the Sea” Now imagine being black and realizing your taxes are being used to pay for a monument that seeks to justify the enslavement and discrimination of your ancestors, even if they were threatened with violence to comply with the society of the time.",

They were set free afterwards once allegiances were proven.\n\nCamp Douglas wasn't the only camp with high mortality rates. All civil war prisons on both sides did. Do to their lack of sanatation, construction, and weather. Also more Union soilders died in Confederate prison camps. Specifically Camp Douglas 10% died whereas in Camp Sumter 28% of the 45,000 Union POW died.  And Confederate Camp Anderson is known historically as the worst civil war prison. Picking only one and suspiciously on the side you don't like seems a little disingenuous.\n\nNew York riots were due to the fact you could pay your way out of the draft with 300 bucks or 5,800 dollars today. Most people such as the Irish just arriving did not have that much money, and blacks were not at the time considered as citizens so they were exempt. So those attacks were most likely do to them not having to fight rather than fighting for blacks. The Gangs of New York movie is probably not the best way to get your information on historical topics.\n\nDesertion happened on both sides. Confederates left at a rate of 10 and 15 percent. Where union was 9 and 12. So seems like your side hated fighting to keep slaves more 🤔 \n\nAnd Confederates as we already went over scalped. Confedertate solders led by bloody bill Anderson who decorated his saddles with unions scalps. And Archie clement who by reputation was his chief scalper. Strangley no mention of union scalping in the civil war hmmm. Now, unless you're mixing wars and events which is a no no you know that. See, that specifically was used on Native Americans from European settlers prior to the war and post civil war to show they saw them as subhuman. FYI post in this case means after and prior is before.\n\nThe Confederate constitution upheld the institution on slavery. Jefferson Davis Confederate president was given authority to suspend habeas corpus. Which he did right away until July 1864, and to declare martial law which he did several times during the war.\n\nAlso they robbed civilians, rounded civilians up for random and unfounded infractions. \n\nWar back then was far more inhuman than it is now. And even more vial prior. \n\nStop rewriting history. 😁",

But I can say that even if they where put up by veterans they still depict and or glorify figures who fought for the right to keep slaves. Which in my opinion it is wrong to keep those “memorials” up. Also taking partial funding from the kkk does not make it any better.

Rogan is also very cognizant of that, so he's willing to listen to and learn from real experts (although he'll sometimes shut down shit that is blatantly false. Sometimes). That makes him a great bellweather for dudebros on current events, and can make him an excellent gateway for subjects that the average person wouldn't normally approach. The problem with Joe is that despite being left on most social issues, he's a sucker for \"nice\" people, and the alt-right FEEDS on that kind of gullible empathy, presenting themselves as these affable \"normal but misunderstood\" people, identifying the non-left issues Rogan leans towards (such as transgender discrimination), and then working him (and his fans) over from there. \n\n\nThe worst part is that they've successfully convinced Joe that \"SJWs\" are this petty monolithic mob of outraged college kids with no real cause and a hatred for free speech, and guys like Rubin, Shapiro, Peterson and Harris will relentlessly feed into that notion, making him into a unwitting mouthpiece for a powerful tool in the fascist arsenal: the weaponized bastardization of \"free speech.\" \n\nBut seeing him shut down guys like Rubin and Crowder when they say dumb shit gives me hope.",

None of which can be considered socialist because socialism means worker control of the means of production and the means of production in Marxist-Leninist states is controlled by communist parties through the government. And neither the government nor the party were accountable to the workers so their economies cannot be described as worker controlled and thus cannot be described as socialist.\n\nYou will also find that some of the best actual criticism of the Soviet Union comes from Socialists and Anarchists.",

The romans had this thing called Damnatio memoriae, where they literally erased someone from history, or tried to do it, we also have the example of people who deny the Armenian Genocide, people who claim that the USA won the Vietnam war, or the Holocaust deniers who do try to erase parts of their history, none of them are marxist in any sense, so even if erasing history were a marxist concepto (which is not) that wouldn't mean that every erasure of history ever would be marxist, because other do that too (even though marxist don't, in reality, but please bear with me). In order to demonstrate that erasing history is marxist, you'd have to either, explain how every instance of doing it is marxist or to point out any specific element in marxism that suggests doing it.\nNow, according to marxism, there's a thing called superstructure, which is dependent on the structure. The structure is economical, so changing it would also change the superstructure, which is where our current narrative of history and tradition lie, so, that sentence you wrote \"You have to deconstruct every aspect of the current capitalist system to replace it with true communism\" is kinda true, but once you understand marxism (which you don't)  you realize that doing that doesn't require to erase history. \n\nFinally, let's talk about the Great Leap Forward. I'm going to be lenient with the fact that you're probably confused with the Cultural Revolution and you referred to the latter and tell you that it wasn't an attempt to to erase history, it was an attempt to get rid of bourgeoise elements present in the culture of China IN THE PRESENT and to also finish with some of the remaining elements of traditional Chinese culture that according to chairman Mao interfered with the revolution.  This has nothing to do with erasing history, since it isn't denying that certain events or things happened, but rather a prohibition against continuing doing such actions on the basis that they were harmful, wether you agree or disagree with Mao (I disagree, btw, since I do consider those would've naturally changed once capitalism had been overcome) you cannot compare his actions and goals with the erasure of history. Erasure of history is to pretend something didn't happen or to deliberately destroy it to make people forget about it and to prevent history from recording it. And well, even if the Cultural Revolution were an example of erasing history, it still wouldn't proof that erasure of history is a marxist concept, because China was the only example you can cherry pick of this being done, when there were lots of other marxist countries that didn't do it at all, that is a logical fallacy.  China's supposed erasure of history (that didn't happen, BTW) is so valid an example of erasure of history being marxist as Stalin's bringing up the images of the old tsars during World War 2 to inspire soviet soldiers is an example of it not being marxist at all. I hope you've understood you're wrong. I recommend further reading on marxism.",

Just like, in the mind of many people who also happen to be confederate apologists, the presence of white males in the SJW movement does not make the movement as a whole less anti-white anti-male.\n\nI also loved how you brought up the election of the first black congressman (I mean, some of the congressional districts in the South were mostly black at the time, so that would be a normal product of a fair election), but failed to mention the initial violence and subsequent discriminational laws propagated by Democrats in a bid to prevent blacks from voting. For the black confederates, you actually got me curious and I checked for a more academically reliable source and came upon this:\n\nhttps://www.theroot.com/yes-there-were-black-confederates-here-s-why-1790858546\n\nPerhaps you will find this interesting:\n\"The vast majority of eyewitness reports of black Confederate soldiers occurred during the first year of the war, especially the first six months. Why? Because after the first Confiscation Act, slave laborers began deserting to Union lines en masse, and free blacks’ expressions of loyalty toward the Confederacy waned.\"\n\nThese \"volunteers\", on average, did not seem to be very loyal to their cause.",

And you conveniently neglect my main point in all this (as well as abandon that civil war history shit because you know I'll spank you in a history contest, wise decision), that it's ultimately irrelevant what anyone outside of those communities thinks. Those people in the areas taking down these statues voted for people that took them down - somewhere down the line the people who made those decisions were put in place by the electorate. If a community wants to take down the statue, you have no right to say they can't and ultimately, the majority of those confederate statues have little historical value as it pertains to the US Civil War anyway - and if you actually watched this video instead of just commenting on it like the thinly-veiled dogwhistle you aspire to be you would know this is the case. \n\nSo how can you actually sit there and argue against the wishes of the community in whose boundaries the statues reside? If they want to keep them up - that's their right - if they want to take them down - that's their right. There is little more you can say against this point.

To me, it looks less like judging people by today's standards and more like distinguishing people who tried to push history into the \"morally right\" direction from the ones that did the opposite. And we should be motivated to do the latter, in order to be sure that our actions will be judged by our descendants as well if we get to a morally ambiguous time.\n\nI may obviously biased as a non-US person, but this is what I think from my point here.",

Yet, you are trying to connect these people (me included) to actions that none of them have condoned; as I said before, it's as productive as saying that you are connected to the crowd that likes shouting “Jews will not replace us” while marching with torches.\n\n3. First, do I understand right that you no longer find it hypocritical to not attack Lincoln for racism but condemn confederate leaders for the constitution they were defending? Second, if Lincoln was really so bad (I don't have such an impression, but your word is heavier here), then I'd argue it's OK to attack his idolized position in US history: false heroes are dangerous for a nation's well-being (and they sometimes eclipse the true heroes that deserve more attention).\n\nYes, bones of the dead should not be dragged into politics; this is the reason I find the politically relevant timing of many confederate monuments built decades after the war quite repulsive.",

However, I still feel convinced by the sources from both academia and relatives of the veterans that Three Arrows cites in the beginning of the video to show that some monuments were mainly set up for political reasons rather than to commemorate the dead (on top of Rogan's remark on how some of these monuments were set up with little regard for material quality just so that their timing was politically relevant).\n\nThree Arrows clearly summarizes his vid in the end: he is for removing the statues from public non-educational spaces. Correct me if I am wrong, but a veteran's grave is not public, so the distinction is quite clear.\n\nAlso, it is excusable to own slaves when it is the norm, but I am afraid that forming your own government in order to include a slavery-protecting clause into your constitution goes beyond simple conformity right into active support of a sin. The latter is just much more grave an evil.\n\nLastly, I am not attacking Lincoln because to me he looks like a person who found himself in a situation he could not completely control and did the best he could; there are cases when “the ends justify the means” mentality renders your victory hollow, but I don't think it's one of them. However, as I said, I am much less aware of US history than of European history, so let's assume you are right and Lincoln was so bad he should not be celebrated at all, even despite all the things he did in the end. Will throwing him from spotlight be an attack on US history? I'd argue that the spotlight will be easily refilled with more deserving people from the era; there were plenty of statesmen and common abolitionists, both in the North and the South (the latter may be less numerous, but I'd say they had to have much bigger balls), that fought, and succeeded, in bringing slavery down.\n\nI just don't see this process as an eternal road downhill: we are objectively in a better place than thousands of years ago, so on the whole our past is quite progressive and has a fair share of true heroes. However, accounting for the bad decisions and morally evaluating them is also extremely important: to learn from our mistakes and also to be sure that our own actions will be subject to such evaluations, where excuses such as “in the end I succeeded” or “I was just following orders/duty” will not fly with our descendants.",

Can valor and loyalty become so misplaced that a person can only be considered a hero if he has rejected them?

Some of these statues could be part of this exhibit.  But the so called compromise position is unfeasible as that it wants all of this nonsense in museums and that's unnecessary to convey the point.  It's a completely inefficient use of resources.",

If you count by households (which is slightly broader), this jumps to 25%. \n\nEven the 25% figure isn't enterly accurate, because there was a lot of people who's job depended on slavery without them personally owning anyone.

The way to recognize a person who has \"listened to or read anything from southerners concerning slavery,\" is to check whether they have noticed. Although I do enjoy that you assume people are physically capable of reading or listening to the words of slavers without agreeing with the slaver's claims.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThen we come to the people who did not own slaves, but were still economically dependent on slavery. For most slave drivers, their job was specifically to manage slaves owned by someone else. *Ignoring these people to defend slavery doesn't make them go away.* We also have all the people who shipped products produced by slaves up north and to Europe, as well as the people who sold to customers dependent of slavery to afford their goods. You have people who produced their own goods, owned their own land, and employed their own family in the family business who were dependent on buyers making their money through slavery. *Ignoring these people to defend slavery doesn't make them go away.* Even more glaringly obvious were the slave markets. If you're a laborer at a slave market you don't own any slaves, but are still dependent on slavery. If you're a salesman at a slave market, putting up other people's slaves for auction you are still dependent on slavery. If you get paid rent because salves are auctioned off on your property, that doesn't inherently mean you (or more accurately your family) own any slaves. *Ignoring these people to defend slavery doesn't make them go away.* \n\nSimilarly, the way most plantation owners, factory owners, and yeoman farmers treated their slaves is not excused by the physical existence of a single individual who didn't treat their slaves as cruelly. If you're going to include Jackson, you might as well include Benjamin Franklin, who treated his slaves better. Specifically, Franklin freed them, took care of their families for the rest of his life, and became a staunch abolitionist after his trial run at owning other humans. There is a particular reason slaves fled the south at such a pace, and why, (as a completely hypothetical comparison, you understand) northern factory workers did not flood south. \n\nAnd of course, as I already mentioned in the comment that triggered you into responding, the 1% figure is created by counting the \"big plantation owners,\" but not their families. Families that used (and I mean that in several senses) the slaves just as much as the person legally listen as the slave's owner on the paperwork. *Ignoring these people to defend slavery doesn't make them go away.*",

Calhoun, one of the major players in US politics you degenerates keep trying to erase. Unlike the soldier Jackson he was a politician, and in practice lead the south politically from the 1820's till he died. His specific position was to call slavery \"a positive good,\" and insisted slavery benefited everyone involved. Note the principles under which the south seceded were specifically codified by Calhoun, as seen in the Nullification Crisis he created. This was the prevailing view of southerners, pretty much until they realized they were about to lose the civil war.\n\nAnd as Virginia was left without any other southern states to supply it, southerners switched to claiming they had overwhelming considered slavery a \"necessary evil.\" Or to dumb that down to a level you might be able to follow, they lied to sound less horrible when they realized the truth didn't support them. This becomes very obvious is you compare the writings of southern leaders before succession took place to their writing at the end of the civil war. \n\nDespite your feelings, those who were farmers weren't in the vast majority. The closest you get is Alabama, where they made up 68.3% of adult farmers over 15 in 1850 (this is cherry picked to be a state closer to your feelings). This figure *includes* the big plantation owners, the small plantation owners, the slave-owning yeomen (no matter much much their existence triggers you), and tenants and farm hands who didn't own any land. The figure would further drop if you include African Americans (who were mostly slaves) and women (of whom there were proportionally fewer farmhand laborers, thereby bringing down the percentage in agriculture). \n\nAlso, the last sentence of the first paragraph should say \"incapable.\"",

Like all human constructs, it is really hard to define clearly. Socialism is when you allow everyone to be more equal by, as you state, taking resources from those who have more than plenty and giving it to those who have few.  Many ideologies try to do this, although all of them only give the wealth to a single group, for example Hitler wanted all of the recourses to go to the \"superior race\". Actual Socialism is [meant] to be for everybody.\n\nCommunism is another step up where everybody is forced into being completely equal in status and wealth. Some people say this is anarchic, and I agree, since this will never work at all, and almost all of its policies are less about the people being equal and more about them being suppressed.\n\nYou can certainly place ideologies on a range of good and bad, but there will always be the ones in the middle. It isnt as clean as half good half bad. Also, that comment on socialism can be applied to essentially any ideology (capitalism being one, with CEO's stealing the wealth of the company etc. ect.).\n\nThat all being said, things like a 40 hour work week, a two day weekend, universal suffrage, and the civil rights movement are all examples of socialist (or at least labor union) policies implemented well. None of them lead to America turning into a dystopian nightmare, so why would things like universal healthcare? If its bad and works out horribly (which it totally might), we as Americans can simply decide to vote out the leaders that implemented them and reverse everything.

    "text": "White Southerner here*. I’m also a dreaded marxist-leninist, one who’s even read the dastardly writings of the white-hating Black Panthers! At least, that’s what I was raised to believe. \n\nThere’s a lot of complicated history here that is simply ignored. 14% of my state voted for Eugene V Debs, the self proclaimed American Bolshevik, who spent time in prison for his vocal opposition to World War 1 and for agitating for revolution.\n\nHowever, you wouldn’t know that reading current Louisiana History textbooks. You also won’t learn that the anarchist Industrial Workers of the World organized one of the first interracial unions here, that the Knights of Labor organized an interracial union in my hometown with a 10,000 strong strike that was put down by white militia killing anywhere from dozens to hundreds of people in the Thibodaux Massacre. You probably won’t hear about the utopian socialist colony of New Llano, although the town with that name is still there. You won’t hear about the 1930s strike of fishermen, utilizing armed resistance over low prices for catches, although a documentary was produced in the 1970s entitled “Huit Pieces et Demi!” which was the strikers’ slogan. \n\nYou will maybe hear about slave rebellions, like the 1811 German Coast Uprising. \n\nBut where are the statues and plaques to commemorate this history? \n\nThe bus boycott tactic made famous by Rosa Parks originated in Baton Rouge. The New Orleans Black Panthers were ambushed and shot up by a police raid. Three Panthers spent 30 years in solitary confinement after this raid, first arrested for defending themselves from the police, and then framed for the murder of a guard, really they were punished for daring to organize an end to prison violence and racial gangs to unite the prisoners. \n\nNone of this history is commemorated and it’s hardly ever discussed. Any resistance to exploitation or racism is hidden, for obvious reasons, especially if the resistance broke down racial walls.\n\nThis is the real revisionism. And it damages the psyche of poor and working people of all races and nations. It makes racism seem universal, hegemonic, and inevitable. It makes exploitation seem natural, inescapable, even if you hate it. \n\n*I’m actually a Cajun-Creole, a group of people that hardly enlisted to fight in the Civil War, and had an extremely high desertion rate. We saw the war as “an American problem.” We didn’t really think of ourselves as American until sometime after World War 2, with forced Americanization and proletarianization. This doesn’t mean we didn’t and don’t have problems with racism and white supremacy. It does mean that for us to stop being “white n****ers,” as Anglos called us, French and Spanish had to be beaten out of us. The US oil companies feared violent resistance to the necessary despoliation of the land in service of the oil industry, and finally sought to proletarianize and Americanize us to avoid this after neglecting us for almost 100 years.",

        "text": "You might be right about the American Revolution. Certainly the Brits would not have spoken too highly of us had we lost. But regarding the Civil War, I definitely think that slavery was the main issue for the south. I mean, they literally said so in writing. The whole thing about state's rights is backwards, one of the big issues (IIRC, it's been a while since I studied it) was that northern states did not allow slaveowners to pass through with their slaves. The South wanted the federal government to protect their \"property rights\" in northern states that did not allow slavery, but the govt. didn't. So one big problem for the South was that the govt. was allowing *too many* state's rights and not exercising its power to force northern states to respect slaveowners. The idea that the South rebelled because of some philosophical commitment to state's rights is just wrong. They were afraid that Congress would soon outlaw slavery, and thought that the federal govt. wasn't going to protect their \"property rights\" (i.e. slaveowner rights), which was really bad because their entire economy AND philosophy was based on slavery and on being superior to blacks. Like I said, they put all this down in writing, so it's essentially impossible to deny. :D",

And most people there never changed.\n\nThere was one great man in the slave south. General William Mahone, who was also the greatest military leader of the Confederacy. Lee was an average leader, but unlike Mahone, he wasn't a \"race traitor.\"\n\nSenator William Mahone was one of the most maligned political leaders in post-Civil War America. He was also one of the most capable. Compared to the Roman traitor Cataline (by Virginia Democrats), to Moses (by African American congressman John Mercer Langston), and to Napoleon (by himself), Mahone organized and led the most successful interracial political alliance in the post-emancipation South. Mahone’s Readjuster Party, an independent coalition of black and white Republicans and white Democrats that was named for its policy of downwardly “readjusting” Virginia’s state debt, governed the state from 1879 to 1883.\n\nDuring this period, a Readjuster governor occupied the statehouse, two Readjusters represented Virginia in the United States Senate, and Readjusters represented six of Virginia’s ten congressional districts. Under Mahone’s leadership, his coalition controlled the state legislature and the courts, and held and distributed the state’s many coveted federal offices. A black-majority party, the Readjusters legitimated and promoted African American citizenship and political power by supporting black suffrage, office-holding, and jury service.  To a degree previously unseen in Virginia, and unmatched anywhere else in the nineteenth-century South, the Readjusters became an institutional force for the protection and advancement of black rights and interests.\n\nAt the state level, the Readjusters separated payment of the school tax from the suffrage, thereby enfranchising thousands of Virginia’s poorest voters.  They restored and reinvigorated public education in the state, and they lowered real estate and personal property taxes.  They banned the chain gang and the whipping post.  At the municipal level, Readjuster governments paved streets, added sidewalks, and modernized water systems.\n\nThe Readjusters lost power in 1883 through a Democratic campaign of violence, electoral fraud, and appeals to white solidarity. While Democrats suppressed progressive politics in the state, other groups of elite white Virginians worked fast to eradicate the memory of Virginia’s experiment in interracial democracy. These were mutually reinforcing projects. Convinced that black enfranchisement was “the greatest curse that ever befell this country,” members of the Association for the Preservation of Virginia Antiquities (APVA), founded in 1889, equated the Readjuster’ rule with “mobocracy” and called for radical pruning of the electorate. After 1900, William Mahone was characterized by whites in Virginia as a demagogic race traitor with autocratic tendencies. This representation was so powerful that as late as the 1940s the worst charge that could be brought against an anti-Democratic opposition candidate was that he had been associated with Mahone and the Readjusters.",

In the 39 general election, the party that won was a left coallition that included Republican (left moderates), Socialist and Communist, the reforms that they promised were social reforms without communism as the final goal (the leader Azaña was for social reform, but only for very minor economics reform). Also, remember than the Republic that the Franco regime ended was a Constitutional Republic with universal voting rights (for men and women), universal free education, serious measures against government corruption and electoral fraud,  freedom of commerce, freedom of speech and assembly and generally what we expect of a modern western nation. So, no they didn't save Spain of communism, nor that was their real goal, but that was the goal that they presented in their propaganda and you know what, the propaganda of fascist dictorships maybe is not very trustworthy. If that was their goal, they wouldn't have killed prodemocratic school teachers. In reality, there was no immininent communsit revolution in Spain and all the parties in the left coalition vowed to uphold the Republic Constituion. Also some of the forces that supported the Republic were right wing nationalists parties (Lliga Catalana, a party backed by Catalan bankers and capitalists and PNV, a traditionalsit party)\n\nThe main different with Franco antisemitism to Nazi antisemitism is that 1) Spain did not have Jews ofr historical reasons, 2) was more religiously than racially motivated and 3) changed a lot due to international pressures (for example, they created the myth that Spanish government helped save thousand of Jews, after well, the allies won and they wanted not to be seen as former Hilter allies, which Spain certainly was, allthough inderectly). But phrases like \"Judeo-masonic communist conspiracy\" that he government speeches and propaganda used a lot doesn't really point to not being a \"Jew hater\".\n\nAnd also again \"El valle de los Caidos\" was built with political prisoners under force labour to commemorate the same guys who actually fought to make them political prisoners.",

An yes during the war the elft radicalize and the fact that the only country that actively supported the Republic where the communist made the prosovietic communists more powerful. But again, I am talking before the war started, and before the war started Spain was in no danger of becoming a communist state, since the measures the Popular Front have promised were basically a continuation of the measures taken in the first two years of the Republic. The ideal outcome would be that the right accepted the victory of the left in fair elections (but well that was impossible, because the forces of the right, with maybe the exception of the Liberal Republican party of Lerroux and the Liberal Republican Right of Alcalá Zamora, did not believe in the Republic and did what they could to sabotage it,  in the 1936 election Calvo Sotelo even called openly for a coup d'etat) or that the coup d'etat was completely twarted, thus changing the high ranking militars for ones that actually wanted to uphold the Constitution.",

Cristopher Columbus also disobeyed orders from the Queen to better the treatment of natives (and stole gold from teh Crown).

        "text": "Several things: Yes disease was especially deadly but forced labor exacerbated this as well as forcing natives to be closer to the disease-carrying Spanish. Abuse exacerbated the disease problem so the Spaniards and Portuguese aren't off the hook for that.\n\nSecond, with regards to slavery, you still have failed to show that slavery did not get worse as the Spanish and Portuguese continued to enslave native and African populations and keep them in bondage even after converting to Christianity. There was clearly moral back sliding.\n\nThird, I never said the Aztecs or Incas were saints, though they were FAR from the only victims of the conquistadors. Just because some of the victims were also assholes doesn't absolve the Conquistadors of their crimes. The Aztecs and Inca had never harmed the Spanish, there were not threats to them, they were simply rich targets. And then other groups like the Arawak of the Antilles were still enslaved despite welcoming the Spanish peacefully and not maintaining cruel empires. This argument is vacuous.\n\nThe conquistadors were evil, by the standards of their own time, by the standards of our time, by the standards of the people they conquered and even the people who paid for their voyages. And before you bring up that typical \"this is white guilt\" bullshit, no, it's not. It's acknolwedging historical reality with no implications that any currently living person is guilty of any of these crimes. But if we pretend they weren't crimes, then we run the risk of committing them or something similar again.",

When he was not in charge, things always got worse. \n\nConquistadores were not saints, but the natives living in countries colonized under Spain, were the natives in the best condition that any other region colonized by other European powers. At least in theory, natives had the same rights that peasants in the most rural Spain (living also in misery).  \n\nSpaniards were very classist, instead of racists (mostly). This is way Conquistadores married the daughters of Montezuma, the Inca nobilities were equals to them. You had even a couple of black conquistadores. Just compare countries colonized by Spaniards vs French, Portuguese, Dutch or English. Where are the native Americans of the USA and Canada? What is the situation of Haiti vs Dominican Republic (half of the same islands)? Natives are much more mixed in Spanish-speaking countries. BTW, the genocides mostly occured after the indepence from Spain, ask Argentina. By genocide I mean the UN definition. \n\nBy the end of s. XIX, Argentina and Venezuela were one of the highest in the world. Twice GDP per capita than Spain. If in the following century, they screwed it,  you can not blame anymore to the Spaniards....",

Mexico, a region of +1M people was conquered by less than 1.400 soldiers, thanks to significant local support. The conquest was maintaned by continuous collaboration. \n\nIf you were a galo, and you were conquered by the Romans, it was a very traumatic and cruel process. No conquest was \"ethical\".

        "text": "Miguel Pino my answer might look as if I’m saying that all Spaniards were evil, which weren’t, that’s why I’ll use conquistadores. One conquistador might have been a good person for his time, but that doesn’t change the fact that he was a conquistador. Just like a slaveowner could be considered a decent person, but that doesn’t change the fact that he was a slaveowner... with all that it implies.\n\nI don’t know the exact number, but I don’t believe that that many died of disease, after all the Black Death only killed 1/3 of Europe. But of those deaths many were because of the destruction of medical institutions and the poor conditions many were in under forced labor, in other word avoidable. \n\nThere were rebellions, but all failed. One must take into account that Atahualpa was taken hostage and would have been killed, many of their forces were already dead and power was fractured because the conquistadores arrived in the middle of a civil war, and gunpowder was very, very overpowered, even in small quantities. Also the Inca Empire had many enemies (that happens when you for an empire), and they sided with the conquistadores first, but they had no idea how screwed over they would be later.\n\nAlright but credit should be given where credit is due. The colonial Peru was one of the times when it was most united and well internally connected. \nIt should be clear by now that I can only speak about the case of Peru, and am not confident enough to make a case for other ex-Spain colonies. Spain gets blamed a lot for the current inequalities, and it might have started with them, but it’s the fuckers that took control after the independence who have more of the blame, who instead of correcting the problems worsened the inequality and the racism.",

It says and I quote---[Animosities over the agreement arose quickly, with neither side fully honoring the terms. Open war again broke out in 1876, and the US government unilaterally annexed native land protected under the treaty in 1877.]\n[The treaty formed the basis of the 1980 Supreme Court case, United States v. Sioux Nation of Indians, in which the court ruled that tribal lands covered under the treaty had been taken illegally by the US government, and the tribe was owed compensation plus interest.

At the time of the war, slavery was alive and well. If it wasn't the main priority, the confederate states wouldn't have kept talking about it in most of their articles of secession, especially not as, you know, the primary reason for leaving. \"It was economics\" is a dumb point, because their economic system was based on slavery. \"States rights\" is also in that category, since the only \"states right\" they cared about was \"right to own slaves\" - they were actively _against_ state rights when it came to northern states refusing to return escaped slaves. Ever hear of the Fugitive Slave Acts? The south then - and still now - have only ever been \"states rights for me, not for thee\". The articles of confederation even expressly forbid member states from banning slavery - so much for \"states rights\".\n\n\"Lincoln wasn't a literal angel\" - nobody cares nor claimed it (except republicans when they want to fallate themselves as \"the party of Lincoln\", then they forget the civil war somehow). To the north, the war was about keeping the union together. To the south, it was entirely about slavery.\n\nThe north _was_ however pushing for a slow end to slavery, since all the anti-slave representatives were in the north, and the government had determined that new states in the west north of a certain line would be free states, and south would be slave states. Eventually though, more states would have been free than slave, and the practice would lose support, which is where they saw the writing on the wall and decided secession was the only option left.\n\n\"How can you be so left or right on this.\"\n\nI don't know, maybe ask yourself? Why do you choose to take a hard right-wing approach to revisionist history? And the ridiculous 'TaXaTiOn AnD rEgUlAtIoN iS sLaVeRy\" bullshit - aren't you quite the tool.",

Imagine if the American government told you to move your possessions to the other side of the country, and did that repeatedly. Imaginr they did that for not only you, but your family and neighbors. I don't think you would like that, and they didn't do it nicely. They forced it on them. They killed people who didn't obey. Sometimes they killed people when they did obey. Sometimes they tricked tribes into marching into firing squads. Sometimes they launched surprise attacks in the morning and slaughtered entire tribes. Sometimes they killed people who were surrendering, walking out to negotiate or complying with orders.",

The UK on the other hand, is a merger between the two that was actually proposed by the Scottish government, leading to the act of Union which was recieved positively and negatively on both sides of the border. Scotland and \"the UK\" have not historically fought each other. Neither are Scottish patriotism and British unionism mutually exclusive. On the contrary, Scots were quite the Empire builders. The comparison to the conflict of interest in being both a patriotic American with Confederate sympathies makes no sense. Utterly different kettle of fish",

You don't care about the suffering endured by the victims of the institution of slavery cause of an act of violent emancipation, that slaves who were denied any basic human dignity, who were at their wits end, who would be ready to die for their freedom rather than continue to endure the anguish of that institution. \n\nEstimated 250 rebellions total in the US, the participants of those likely making a minute number of the total slave population at every point it occurred, a minute number compared to the 4 million slaves in the south before their emancipation, compared to the amount of slaves being treated like cattle since colonial days. \n\nYou genuinely value the owners more than the slaves, you are incapable of impartially viewing the huge amount of suffering ended,  through a violent mean sadly, but that otherwise was not going to happen because the US would rather split itself than risk racial equality and a hit to the economy of human cattle. \n\nThe simplistic view of reality is yours (since you want to assume mine, I can only return the favor), where you are bent on categorizing races that have had no genuine data or even historical manifestation that can lead to the rational belief of racial supremacy.

        "text": "It's a nice idea, but those rights don't always exist without the government. Just look at all of the people who were lynched after the Civil War. The states that allowed this should have met the federal standard of justice but chose not to and as a result many, many people were wrongfully murdered. I'll meet you halfway however. Maybe government doesn't \"give\" us our rights, but I will argue that it \"defines\" what our rights as citizens are. And just to be clear- I am very much for something of a middle ground. I think that freedom and local community/government is very important. I'm just arguing for central government and that you need to have both for equilibrium (checks and balances and all that). \n\n\nThe essence of what I'm saying in response to your comments is that, yes, Lincoln certainly overstepped his executive bounds, but at the time that is what the situation called for and I think he handled it expertly. At other times it is important for local governments to call in question the actions of the federal branch. It's all part of the ebb and flow. Different times call for different strategies. \n\n\nAnd listen, I'm not super educated on the pronoun issue you brought up- if it is true you can spend time in jail for not using someone's correct pronoun, then I definitely have issue with that. But as you said this is a thing being decided on a local level at the moment so it's not the federal government. Therefore I would argue bringing that up goes against your whole point.",

        "text": "I see a lot of your points and concede in agreeing that Lincoln and his admin were clearly creating a new definition of executive power. That being said, we are disagreeing on one fundamental point here: the South did not act in a response to Lincoln. Lincoln acted in response to the South. The Civil War had been brewing long before Lincoln came into office. The South wanted to secede before Lincoln. Lincoln, in fact, had a rather moderate view on slavery when first elected and was going to allow the South continue the practice. He was against expansion but would not meddle where it was already a thing. We did not see a radicalized Lincoln until his second term, in which he then decided to end slavery completely. But since you raise some valid disputes I'll try and give some links with more perspective. \n\nLincoln suspends habeus corpus: Well the confederates were the enemy and the president didn't want them organizing in Maryland where the government was centered. I'm not saying it's completely justified but it's easy to see how this was a strategic advantage. https://www.reference.com/history/did-lincoln-suspend-writ-habeas-corpus-95b63b23300c340d\n\nThe draft: Unfortunate to say the least. I can't attest to the necessity of it during the Civil War but I can understand it if it was an absolute necessity to defeat the South. Interesting you would bring up the riots though because the amount of violence would be completely unjustifiable by today's standards of Baltimore and Ferguson. In fact. many blacks were slain unjustly during this riot. https://www.history.com/topics/american-civil-war/draft-riots\n\n\nYour view similar to how my friends from South Carolina were taught the Civil War. Fortunately this was a fairly well-documented event in our history and much of the \"Lost Cause\" has been debunked for some time. In the \"War of Aggression\" the aggressors were the South, who wanted to expand into Central America and feared that the federal government would abolish their slave trade. They attacked Fort Sumter of their own volition. And I would argue that Lincoln did an exceptional job taking control of what could have been the complete annihilation of the \"United\" States. \n\n\nhttp://www.historynet.com/causes-of-the-civil-war",

The Merchant Venturers (the society who'd originally put it up) resisted and argued that while slavery was regrettable, for Colston and his peers it was just business and he had been a huge benefactor to the city (for the record, his statue went up in 1895,  over 170 years after he'd died as a reminder of his philanthropic contributions to Bristol).\n\nSince the statue was pulled down and covered so widely in the news, more people than ever know about Colston, including outside the UK. History didn't die with the removal of his statue, it was given a new lease of life.",

If it isn't possible to move them or if there's no museum that will take them, turn their meaning into something positive by building educational sites around them. Install informational plaques (not little ones, big ones, all around them) and big info-tables, that tell a passerby who built them and what the malicious intent behind that was.\n This has been done to great effect here in Germany and Austria with certain pieces of Nazi art and architecture. In essence: turn them from artifacts of the Lost Causers into sites that educate people on the evils of historic revisionism.",

Otherwise, it will be lost.\n\nMonuments - whether one wishes to admit it or not - are critical in telling the history of the events that happened.

This is what history tells us, it’s very well documented by the Confederacy. Now I want to ask you three simple questions. What do these statues mean to you?

So I just want to make this clear, the struggles of the south we’re not due to Northern aggression but to a refusal of modernizing their industry. The south was once the canonic power house of the United States and it very much prospered. But as the north modernized, factories made slavery out of date. Now the south refused to modernized, they felt it was an attack on their way of life... which is wasn’t.. that’s just human history... the North combined with ambitions to free the slaves pressured the south to change. Now when you say “wanting to be left alone” you must also realize that by association, you are saying maintain slavery. You must also realize that the southern states did want to expand their industry westward and into Mexico. They didn’t want to be “left alone” they had ambitions for expansions. In fact, that very ambition is why they would raid union supplies and forts in order enact their ideas of expansion! And I’m sorry, but attacking and seizing munitions are clear aggressions and have been used as means to go war. You can’t honestly believe that the south was some innocent victim. They, like the north, escalated to the point of going to war. Plus, and I know this might be hard, but the south lost. Hell, today’s the anniversary of Gettysburg, arguably the south’s biggest lost! I don’t know about you but it seems stupid to have statues to a traitorous, illegitimate, and ultimately defeated force.",

    "text": "I was long undecided whether Confederate monuments in the South should be preserved or not. I mean, any decent person would agree that the Confederates were scum... but still, monuments are history, and I don't support the destruction of art or statues no matter how much of a scumbag the subject of the piece was.\r\n\r\nWe know Nero was a tyrant, we known Henry VIII was voted as the worst monarch in British history for a good reason, we know Genghis Khan was infamous for a reign of terror... but despite all of those personas being absolute degenerates, I doubt anyone would suggest demolishing their monuments, right? I mean, the presence of their monuments does not in any way represent that anyone would like to resurrect them into power today.\r\n\r\nHowever, here is why I've come to the conclusion that Confederate monuments should be demolished. Not only that, but I think the Confederate flag (or flags) should be banned from official use... just like the Nazi flag is not waved around Germany.\r\n\r\nSee, while the historical figures I've mentioned are well in the past and have no modern ideological claim... the Confederate ideology is still out there. I mean, it started not long after the end of the Civil War, and lasts to this day, the neo-Confederate ideology and the \"Lost Cause\" nonsense.\r\n\r\nI've done my research in various political Facebook groups, and I was horrified to see how much there is an attempt to justify what the Confederacy did. Neo-Confederates attempt to push the \"Lost Cause\" narrative, claiming the Civil War was not about slavery but about \"state rights\"... they just omit the part how the \"right\" they were talking about was mainly the \"right\" to hold other beings as slaves.\r\n\r\nAll of the slave women raped, all of the men whipped, all of the abuse, the chains, the humiliation... nope, neo-Confederates conveniently cut it out.\r\n\r\nAnd that ideology never stopped! The lynching continued well into the 20th century. In the 1920, the KKK peaked 6,000,000 members, that was Confederate ideology right there. The horrific segregation laws continued into the 1960s, and same was with the anti-miscegenation laws that literally had humans sent to prison for having interracial relationships.\r\n\r\nBut that didn't stop in the 1960s! In 2017, a violent rally took part in Charlottsville, Virginia, called \"United the Right Rally\" against the removal of Confederate monument. In the rally, Confederate and Nazi flags were waved.\r\n\r\nThe reason I support the removal of Confederate monuments is because that ideology, the horrific and vile ideology of slavery and the subjugating of other human beings, is still there! The dehumanisation of black people is still there. Those monuments are part of that ideology and are used to preserve it.\r\n\r\nAnd you know what? I honestly understand where neo-Confederates are coming from... it's not easy to admit your ancestors were lowlife scum who fought to preserve slavery, so you create a new narrative. Will the descendants of  Nazi soldiers try the same in the future? Who knows.\r\n\r\nAnd yes, I know not all Confederate soldiers were for slavery, some were drafted against their will... and? So were many soldiers serving in the German Army in WWII. Your point is...? The ones with a moral compass deserted, and the ones with a moral compass and courage did what the great Newton Knight and the Free State of Jones did, and resisted the Confederate regime.\r\n\r\nThose monuments need to be demolished, pretty much as we don't have Nazi monuments around today. \r\n\r\nNo black child should have to walk past a monument which was the gathering point of those who violently lynched his great uncle, and which still serves as a gathering point for those who lament the loss of the Confederacy and lament the abolition of slavery.",

    "text": "As a direct descendant - from multiple lines - of at least 3 of the people to whom these monuments are commonly erected - yes. They should all come down. Every one of them should be removed. Teaching the history of racism in the United States does not require statues glorifying slavery, racism, and hatred. All the things named after them - all the roads, schools, public buildings - should be renamed. None of that will affect what is included in history books. Maintaining things like battlefields (Manassas or Gettysburg or Vicksburg, for example) or war hospitals or other similar actually historically relevant locations is sufficient - and can present the information in the light of historical scholarship rather than racist screed.\nI live in VA - and in this state there are currently multiple armed forces installations named for confederate leaders, multiple roads named for them, many statues erected to them. But there is also the Manassas battlefield - and that does more to actually illuminate the history of the conflict than any of the other things mentioned. Keep that one.\n\nOh, and in re: slippery slope - okay. So what? Even if the slippery slope happens and ALL statues of individual leaders are removed - inclusive of Mt. Rushmore (Which is, absolutely, a monument of white supremacy, taking a sacred Native location and defacing it with images of the culture which killed and dislocated an enormous percentage of Natives. And it was done by a man with specific and clear ties to white supremacist groups, so this was no accident.), so what? No history is lost. The books and documents still tell the history. The battlefields still exist. If we took every single statue to any individual down, possibly replacing some with historical markers or ... I don't know, models of the water molecule... it would make no actual difference to historical knowledge.",

True, Arnold had been dead for some 60 years when the civil war started but what  is another historical rewrite in the Trump era?\n\nHow about adding an Arbeit Macht Frei gate around the statue of Jefferson Davis, after all it was just as false for the jews in 1942  as for the blacks before the civil war.",

But she turns around and uses it as an argument in favor of her position, when it absolutely isn't. If every historical figure is imperfect and their likeness is not meant to be \"worshipped,\" then why on Earth is she acting like tributes to them are sacrosanct, and the mere suggestion of removal is a threat against civilization itself? And also why are the monuments consistently created in a style that is framed in an inherently idolizing way? This country is really struggling with the notion of viewing these monuments as impeachable and impermanent, that's what this debate is about. But it's just the logical way of treating statues that were erected on public land, with very clearly divisive political intent.",

Many legitimate.  But many not.\n\nI also cant help but point out that these monuments are protested by Democrats, when they were erected by Democrats, to honor Democrats.

Now I'm of the opinion that statues of Jackson (along with other US Presidents like Washington for example) should he taken down due to their racist past. However, I am nothing if not a Klugscheißer, and to use a picture of a US President with an inscription added after the Union recaptured the largest city in the Confederacy with the added inscription Glorifying the Union cause in the picture and insinuating that it is an example of a Confederate monument is simply wrong, and while I'm of the opinion that it should be taken down anyways, I point this out to give you a heads up before some opportunistic fascist comes trolling on your video and points out this mistake and \"puts their finger in the bullet hole\" so to speak.\n\nAll that being said, I did enjoy the video.
