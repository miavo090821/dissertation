in a country where police kill more than 1,000 people each year and people need to protest all across the country just to get a couple of those officers charged once in a blue moon how does this 15-year-old black child end up sentenced to 65 years in prison for a murder the police commit the answer well it might surprise you felony murder is one of the most unjust tools in the criminal system and I have hated it with a passion since the day they taught me about it in law school when you think about how the criminal system expands its powers to fill the prison industrial complex you should think of felony murder so what is felony murder felony murder allows someone to be criminally held responsible for murder if someone dies while they're committing a felony even if they did not intend to kill anyone even if they didn't kill anyone even if the police killed someone which is what happened to Lei Smith in 2015 when Lei was 15 years old he and a group of four other friends broke into an unoccupied home a neighbor saw this and called the police and when the police arrived they claimed that two of the boys in the group fired at the officers so they responded by shooting and killing one of the boys 16-year-old at Dante Washington 15-year-old leef did not shoot at the police and wasn't armed with a weapon Le's only crime was breaking into the unoccupied home but because burglary is a felony and felony murder allows the state to hold you responsible for any death that occurs during the commission of a felony the state charged these teenage boys for the death of a Dante Washington who not only did the police kill but had he lived they would have been Prosecuting a Dante as well as the fact that had a Dante committed the burglary alone and been killed by police and there were no codefendants to charge with felony murder it's unlikely the police would have ever been charged and what happened to L is not an anomaly this is how felony murder is regularly used felony murder is disproportionately used against black and Latino boys and men mostly Latino actually and is rarely used against white men and boys because felony murder is built on the idea that white men are individuals but black and Latino boys and men are groups where all are guilty for the actions of one the felony murder rule is indifferent to individual culpability whether an individual is actually responsible for the murder as well as it allows prosecutors to circumvent their responsibility for proving an individual's culpability and each element of the crime this group liability is what led to the Scottsboro boys and the Central Park 5 now the exonerated five if you don't know who they are the Scottsboro boys were a group of nine teenage black boys who are falsely accused of raping two white women on a train near Scottsboro Alabama in 1931 and the Central Park 5 were five black boys falsely accused of raping a woman in Central Park in 1989 the Central Park 5 have since been exonerated and had their stories translated to TV Ava dues when they see us Yousef Salam was recently elected to the New York City Council and all five men recently spoke out against Donald Trump who previously ran ads in the paper calling for their lives at this year's DNC but speaking of the need to protect yourself today's sponsor is Aura if you haven't already been taking precautions with

social security number and phone number along with alternate names and birth dates and members of the hacker group have reportedly release this information for free online I would be a lot more afraid that the hackers would get me if I didn't use Aura Ora alerts me if they find my phone number email or social security number on the dark web they're going to let me know fast if anyone tries to use this information to access my credit or bank accounts they give me up to $5 million in identity theft Insurance should the worst case scenario happen they also provide a bunch of other features to

find out if your personal data is exposed I highly recommend you do that now cuz not only is national public data not going to do anything to help you they probably won't even suffer any consequences for the leak in the first place ain't that's a mess thank you Aura while this is a regular occurrence for Black and Latino boys and men I'm referring to being rounded up by the system and held disproportionately responsible for murders they didn't commit I emphasize again that this is not true for their white counterparts in a national empirical study on racial bias accomplice liability in the felony murder rule in the Denver law review they provided a stunning comparison to illustrate the way the felony murder is used to individual iiz white boys and men but deindividualized their colored counterparts the example they provide is in 2016 the US attorney for the southern district of New York used felony murder to charge 120 people mostly black and Latino young men in their late teens and early 20s for the deaths of eight people even though a significant amount of the young men had absolutely nothing to do with the deaths they then compared that to the January 6th Insurrection that resulted in the deaths of seven people yet none of the 1,17 71 people charged with their participation in the Insurrection were charged with felony murder or as accomplices none all charged as individuals there is an ease in which the state is willing to throw away the lives of black and Latino boys and men in Mass but could not fathom to do the same to white men you know who was also a victim of the felony murder rule it's crazy how few people know the real reason T did the race a 16-year-old T shot to Fame in 2017 when he dropped a song the race about Banger on the day he was captured by [Music] authorities if you know about tayk you know this iconic feels like the wrong word so I guess Infamous notorious photo of tayk holding his own wanted photo T was captured by the US Marshall after 3 months on the run after cutting off his ankle monitor while out on bail for the crime he would eventually be sentenced to 55 years in prison for when the race first went viral TK became a primary example for people to point to of authentic rappers who really live their Rhymes and are dangerous gangsters and all this other stuff that was only exacerbated by rumors he allegedly murdered another person while doing the Race a charge he's currently awaiting trial on but the truth isn't quite that although TK is awaiting trial on that rumored case TK doing the race and being sentenced to 55 years in prison had less to do with him being really about that life or an exceptionally dangerous person and more to do with him being a 16-year-old who was scared to death of spending the the rest of his life in prison for a murder he didn't commit because prosecutors wanted to use felony murders accomplice liability to hold him responsible so let's talk about the case that made TK du the race in 2016 Megan Holt and Ariana Barat came up with a plan to rob a 17-year-old white boy they were friends with and they called TK and a couple of other black teenage boys to help them carry out the robbery the girls let TK and the others into the house and they robbed the young men but as they were leaving there was a confrontation that led to one of the other participants shooting in and killing Ethan Walker TK did not shoot Ethan he was actually in the home searching for money and drugs at the time Ethan was shot and he was a juvenile yet as is often the case for black boys he was tried as an adult and despite not being the one who killed the young man he was found guilty and sentenced to 55 years in prison meanwhile what happened to the girls whose plan this actually was who set all these events in motion they did not try the worlds as adults they let them plead to the much lesser charges of aggravated robbery and allowed them to test ify against the black boys they brought into this plan in exchange for a 20-year sentence no accomplish liability for them they get to be individuals they get to be children while tayk and other black boys are responsible for the crimes of the whole which is a fact tayk himself is reflected on tweeting from his jail cell last year I really just need one chance at adulthood I bet if I was a little white kid they wouldn't have given me no 55 years for a prime I was alleged to play the most insignificant role in when I was 16 they would have rightfully argued that my mind wasn't fully developed and gave me Rehabilitation and a second first chance at adulthood one of my codefendants was a white girl who was 16 just like me they didn't certify her as an adult but they certified me and pimp as adults pimp got 30 I got 55 she ended up getting 10 years of probation without no deal that girl at home right now not sure if y'all know I got sentenced as an adult to 55 years in prison for a crime where I wasn't even the shooter I wasn't even alleged to have a gun I was never even suspected to have pulled the trigger or hurt anyone I was young young and I didn't have no positive figures around I'm sitting here thinking about all my fans I love and miss y'all I know there's a lot that I haven't directly spoken on and there are many things my fans know but I'm not sure everybody else does I've been here for 5 and 1/2 years now and I feel indebted to y'all for going so crazy behind me it's still crazy to me that I never had a chance to live outside as an adult I've been locked up and in and out of the justice and CPS system for my whole life I love my fans and I don't want anyone to think I'm promoting or really recommending violence he said that's why I really dedicated a lot of my time in here to using the success of my music to have a positive impact on other young artists even if it's something small like taking a phone call or writing a letter to keep them positively inspired regardless of my situation the movement is eternal understand I'm not highlighting the differences between how the criminal system treats white boys and men versus how it treats black and Latino boys and men because I want white people to also be rounded up and unfairly railroaded by the criminal system I'm pointing it out to you because I want the system to level down not up I would like the system to lend the same Mercy to black and brown people but I needed to show yall exactly how and why the system doesn't do that [Music]
