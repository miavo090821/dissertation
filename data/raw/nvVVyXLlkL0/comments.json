    "text": "Hi Eddie, I’ve been reading a few books on socialism the last 3 months or so to better understand the ideas of it. I was wondering since you’ve read so many books and you talk about 1 book at a time in some of your TikToks and go more into detail on some of them here. What if you setup an Amazon Wish List(🤢apologies for mentioning Bezos) that was public with all the books that you would personally recommend for your followers to read. Then you could put it in a linktree or if the link would fit in your bio that would be cool too. It’s kind of like a book club, but everyone learns at their own pace. Especially since you gain new followers every day; they would be able to look at the list of books that you’ve talked about previously and know which ones to buy. I don’t know, just a thought.😊 -Anna",
