welcome to the ghosts of plum run hour on midwestern marks i'm tim russo author of the star wars series for leftists ghosts of plum run this is the annotated audiobook series of uh the series and what i'm going to do is read the book so there it is we're going to start out with uh the the forward and an introduction and in each episode uh we will do a little annotation sort of background um on the project and the book uh and today's episode we are going to first talk about the cover uh that's how we're going to annotate this episode this episode will be a little shorter because most of the uh chapters are about 30 pages so i don't know how long it's going to take to read one chapter or we'll find out but as you can see there are quite a few chapters um and we're going to begin with reunion um so let's get started let's jump right into it and afterward we'll have an annotation reunion 1897. in the dry creek bed of plum run a cat pawed at the feet of recelus maori his stare fixed a head at a memory maori did not notice the photographer pouring powder into the flash lamp next to the camera's tripod half a dozen old men between maori and the photographer gingerly bent down to place themselves amidst the rocks age creaking in their knees and their backs while the youngest among them age 50 chose the largest boulder to perch onto at the front of the shot he struck his finest pose a hundred yards up the shallow slope of cemetery bridge three more old-timers stood at the base of a brand new granite plant at the crest atop which a solid brass soldier towered in bayonet charge at double quick aimed at plum run below they watched the younger man at the front taking great pains that the camera catches good side i may have had too much to drink at the hotel last night henry field wondered squinting but that's billy nixon isn't it one of your drummer boys william colville replied leaning against the cane a drummer boy himself during the war fifield was named drum major of the regiment in august 1863 one month after gettysburg so anyone in the regiment can be in that picture whether or not they were in the charge fightfield said in disbelief nixon didn't make that stand in those rocks looks like he held off that brigade all by himself colville laughed to be fair it was a long night at the hotel charles muller piped in maybe he's lost is this why you don't want to be in the pet in that picture flyfield ask mueller who just looked down at the ground colville chuckled guess that means you can get on in there too fei field colville said damn kid was barely any use at all and now look at him posing for the papers back home fifield said agitated weren't you detached in company c for duty at headquarters that day five field colville asked indeed i was fly field answered all i had to do with this charge was run down there and gather up you wounded same as him flyfield paused staring down the ridge in disbelief his anger growing i know you can't get down this hill colonel but muller you ought to beat get down there fightfield said waving his arms at the photographer you were in this charge billy nixon wasn't hands in his pockets at the base of the monument mueller looked up at the bronze soldier oh i think i'll let good old billy nixon take my place mueller said in a few years mueller would change his name his german name to miller if this monument had that serpent on it billy nixon wouldn't be caught dead down there colville said that was news to flyfield who had developed a nose for news after the war feifil became a news man in wisconsin then michigan and by 1902 would own and edit the wellington enterprise in lorraine county ohio just outside oberlin though he was far removed from the first minnesota's veterans affairs reunions and meetings were such things as monument proposals were discussed fightfield traveled from ohio to gettysburg in july 1897 with over 70 of the regiment survivors from all over america for the dedication of the monument to their regiment's charge at sundown on the second day of the battle of gettysburg july 2nd 1863 they'd all spent last night at the eagle hotel celebrated by adams county locals and an enormous delegation arriving by train from both minnesota and washington hangovers gripped them all we proposed the serpent for this spot fightfield asked we did colville replied leaning on his cane to steady his shattered body with a delicate care that only comes with 34 years of practice colville looked up at the statue that soldier up there was meant to be bayoneting a serpent now that's the forward that opens the book so let's talk about this bayonetting serpent um why is this a story for leftist why is the first minnesota's charge a story for leftists it begins uh for most of us with this uh statue or proposal for their statue at gettysburg they wanted to bayonet a serpent they wanted to be depicted as bayoneting a serpent and what is there today is definitely not a soldier bayoneting a serpent what is there today is a nondescript soldier charging at double quick down the ridge in the research for the book i learned that the first minnesota veterans in 1889 proposed several statues for that spot one of which is there now another one where a soldier is is holding up his dying comrade and the third one is this one where uh the cut was now the cover of my book uh volume two serpents and dust with a soldier bayonating a serpent and the reason this uh made it to the cover of my book and is the beginning of this series is here you can see the dialectic um it's almost it's very rare to see evidence of the dialectic across 150 years uh let alone in uh stone and bronze uh on a historic battlefield but here we have the dialectic so what where is the dialectic in this statue you can see that the gettysburg battlefield memorial association when they decided not to use the statue with a soldier bait ending a serpent made a decision and that decision really blew up when this image of this soldier bane ending a serpent was posted by the gettysburg battlefield facebook page this past summer um right after around the george floyd protests um june i believe or july sometime around the anniversary of the battle of gettysburg uh somebody at the bat at the gettysburg battlefield found this image of the soldier baiting the serpent original proposed first minnesota monument and posted it on the facebook page and you can just imagine the surprise of the confederate sympathizer audience that tends to make up the civil war reenactor battlefield visitor community it blew up with about 900 comments on this one little image of a soldier bayoneting a serpent um and as soon as i saw that i grabbed the image from the battlefield facebook page and it is now the cover of volume two and it will also be the cover of just about every other uh book in this series and in addition uh it's going to be uh the little graphic at the beginning of each chapter such as chapter one breakfast in uniontown there you have our bandit or our soldier bayonetting a serpent not since we have a little more time i'm gonna just go right into uh chapter one after the reunion so chapter one is breakfast in uniontown ghosts of plum run volume two serpents and dust june 30th 1863. morning sir toby said to colonel colville piercing the quiet like a bird's chirp counting up rations from last night's hall as they broke toby surveyed the embarrassment of riches before him when colonel william koval of the first minnesota crawled out of his tent raising his towering frame to stretch yawn and dress in the glow of sunrise colville seemed out of place because he was rubbing sleep from his eyes wondering what to do with himself good morning toby colville managed through his splitting hangover stumbling at the front of his tent putting on his uniform toby shook his head with a chuckle coffee sir toby ass pouring a cup for the colonel that is a fine notion colville muttered struggling to the fire for his coffee tumbling onto a stool some welcome we got last night toby said handing handing colville his cup colville paused taking his coffee smelling it making sure he was able to drink it without making himself sick hesitantly taking his first sip of the day colville announced the obvious i reckon this entire core was drunk toby smiled gonna be a slow morning colonel as it should be these boys need a full day's rest after that march colville said deciding it was safe to gulp down the coffee find coffee you made toby never seen so much whiskey as this town poured out last night colonel that's what we said refilling colville's cup we must never speak a word of it colville said they were surrounded by food ham bacon biscuits bread apple butter bread potatoes onions milk cakes pies a fire brewing morning's first coffee toby just stared at baskets brimming with uniontown's bounty laughing to himself the ladies of uniontown hadn't stopped showering the second core of the army army of the potomac with provisions of every kind since their first steps were heard from the southwest marching into town the night before over the hills north and west cosmic cyclones exploded with eternal power as the first ghost of gettysburg danced a serpent in the valleys robert e lee's army of northern virginia unleashed a horror across the land the ghost wind in lee's sails but calm across the hills allowing toby's campfire to brew his coffee duality yin and yang utopia to dystopia the ghost rose to its crescendo that day tears shed by children tied into chain gangs dragged along with lee's army coiling across the foothills of the appalachians the confederacy's property had been stolen so the first priority of lee's men upon crossing the mason-dixon line into pennsylvania was to collect it no african-american family was safe no papers adequate no townspeople's begs for their neighbors mattered hundreds born free would learn for the first time on june 30th 1863 what toby had learned from birth slavery the time had come the ghost power had multiplied like butterfly wings crossing the ocean into a typhoon over decades the ghost haunted time and space around this lowly regiment blowing a breath to turn peter marks down a lane in cheshire england then blazing nightmares into his sleep prodding him this way and that onto a boat for america in blizzards across the prairie the ghost transformed a little girl named millie in saint paul into a virtuoso fiddler and an irish boy named sheamus to love her in rhode island the ghosts cast spells of flies over little rus raceless maori threw it through a witch who went on strike whose long dead husband once painted a cotton banner for her out of negro cloth to march with on a plantation in the virginia peninsula the ghost lashed ten-year-old toby relentlessly and soothed him in his striped pants sewn by his aunties with scraps of the same negro cloth in their slave quarters and it gave a puppy named flash a home with john fisher on cemetery ridge in gettysburg where both waited for toby's regiment to arrive in a day or two with corporal peter marks and private resellers maori power collapsed onto itself like spinning walls of a hurricane soon to peak such was the terror spread that day in pennsylvania among people mag devitt was taught were somewhere between yellow or black rounded up like wayward cattle these generals made special arrangements to bring their new contraband along with them on their march north the new slaves fates to be decided at an auction block one day but for now there was invasion to attend to so these americans endured a forced march across their own country a rattle on the serpent's tail in chains for days and days before being dragged to hell toby's old home across the hills from their unheard whales toby noticed a lady approach the camp are you the minnesota boys toby and colville looked up to see deborah hamburg waddling toward them from town the orange of sunrise behind her a tiny girl in hand who carried a basket colville's hangover shot through him as toby accepted that the love of uniontown would smother them every moment they were there toby looked at colville who just rubbed his forehead more toby laughed at colbill who stood to greet the lady and waved mightily attempting to summon sobriety somehow colonel william colville first minnesota at your service madam mrs hamburg shooed little girl toward the camp go on take it to them mrs hamburg encouraged the child who ran carefully toward the campsite keeping the basket steady give it to the gentleman at the fire mrs hamburg said pointing the girl toward toby i believe she called you a gentleman toby don't disappoint the young lady colville teased toby stood up brushed himself off for presentation fighting up north shore is different toby chuckled to himself he bent toward the girl who held out a basket of eggs caldwell and toby both gaped in awe can't remember the last time we had eggs here ma'am toby said bowing to the girl to take her basket thank you very kindly fresh this morning mrs hamburg declared finally arriving in camp a bit winded we don't have enough chickens for this whole army here mrs hamburg admitted waving demonstratively at the countless swarm of tents consuming her hometown but maybe just enough for the state my husband bought fur to make hats from colville's headache eased with reminders of home well well a buyer of minnesota furs he said bowing my husband mr frederick hamburg was this town's hatter mrs hamburg announced fur from minnesota was the finest very kind of you to visit colville delighted mr hamburg died last year sadly mrs hamburg said or he'd be here himself it falls to me to greet you your state helped raise many a family in this little village colonel we never expected such a welcome culvert complimented when i heard there was only one minnesota regiment here with this core mrs hambrick said well i just had to find it very glad to have you in uniontown quaker by birth about 25 miles north in bendersville pennsylvania in 1812 little debra hewitt was raised to despise slavery in a close-knit nook of hills in adams county where quaker farmers fought slavery with their every ounce every breath only eight miles south from deborah's childhood home down the carlisle road toward gettysburg lived william and phoebe wright who began hiding escaped slaves with the support of the quaker community of adams county in 1819 when deborah was seven the rights became legendary on the trail northward for freedom providing refuge for a constant stream of escaped slaves for over four decades on occasion william wright enlisted deborah's parents the hewitts so little deborah often met runaway slaves as a child strangers turned up all the time she watched her mother always welcome strangers with food and it stuck so it came naturally to mrs hamburg to organize uniontown's entire agricultural output to deluge the second core constantly until it marched out of uniontown well-fed well rested for this rest the first minnesota could not have fallen upon fresher linens in a more feathered bed if paradise could be found in an america boiling with war in 1863 it was uniontown settled by german immigrants flowing southward through gettysburg barely 15 miles north uniontown began by straddling the intersection of two pikes between hagerstown and baltimore around 1745 a german named peter moser established a tavern at the crossroads where a tiny village calling itself the forks grew amongst farms typical of the pennsylvania dutch germans they were a pious handful of yeoman farmers relying on the traffic to and from baltimore for survival in 1813 they renamed the forks uniontown proposing to put be the country the county seat of a new county called union in honor of america's union but the first ghost of gettysburg had other plans for the union in 1837 the new county would be named not union but instead after a slaveholder charles carroll a signer of the declaration of independence despite owning slaves himself carol opposed slavery it is this crease where the first ghost of gettysburg settled in just how this conflict affected carol's own mind manifested in an america split against itself in precisely the same way it ate at him slowly like a cancer unseen but not bothered over very much like a ghost in the closet or the attic always there thus feeling a bit bit guilty enough about the whole thing carol introduced gradual abolition into the american to the maryland legislature but of course carol never freed his own slaves no no that wouldn't do carol's end of life attempt to buy his way into heaven still a slave holder at the age of 91 was to be president of something calling itself the auxiliary state colonization society of maryland whose goal was to send the slaves back to africa sadly carroll never did send the troublesome negroes away but he did get a county named after him so it all worked out just grand for him charles carroll gone from this earth the ghost remained in the county named for him one day the ghost blew an ocean into a collection of carroll county upper crust slave holding folk who decided the first railroad in those parts wouldn't go not through uniontown but instead westminster only seven miles away thus was the end of uniontown's place on any map it vanished into its own rolling valleys and farmland the pattern was set money would follow slavery wherever it went in america no cost labor and impossible profit incentive to resist all up and down the chain of supply and demand any good or service including within its price unpaid involuntary labor had the advantage always everywhere it was an addictive lesson the entire country learned instinctively consciously or not the way a biological mutation works to ensure survival of a species or not then if it works is passed on to the next generation and if it doesn't is never repeated the claws and fangs of an all-powerful prophet incentive serpent sank deep into the soul of a nation in this way time forgot uniontown where labor was paid and voluntary until it became the oasis where the first minnesota would get its final long days repose before hurling itself into the ages against the serpent coil around america suffocating it the serpent moved rumors were flying across carroll county for weeks that robert e lee's army of northern virginia was heading north uniontown had been tense with fear a good long while men on horseback scouting the countryside day and night to learn who was coming from where when how many were they union troops or was it confederate cavalry general jeb stewart or one of lee's core certainty only arrived with a rider bursting into uniontown from union bridge the next town to the south and west galloping through main street calling out the news hancock's second core it's our boys the writer cried out sweet relief lifted worry from the town like sunlight dispatching a fog word spread across carroll county like electricity until it reached mrs hamburg in retirement after her husband's death living quietly on her son's farm after she sold the hat shop on main street are you sure mrs hamburg asked her son desperation that it be true bursting within her they're coming up through liberty her son shouted in from the porch then johnsville then union bridge probably going through mutton town i'd guess then they are to rest here tomorrow they've been marching all day should be marching in here just after sundown mrs hamburg popped up from her chair john brown's body lies a muldering in the grave mrs hamburg proclaimed to the heavens much work to be done life filled her again like before her husband died she met her husband frederick hamburg in gettysburg and they were married on the hewitt family farm in bendersville christmas eve 1835 by 1840 frederick was ready to break out on his own from his father's farm one day frederick met george keller at his hat shop on the main drag in uniontown he gave it some thought and by 1842 owned the building setting up a home there for his wife who bore him five children as the town's leading lady deborah slowly shed her most conservative quaker ways keller and hamburg hats grew to employ a good chunk of uniontown the family joined the uniontown church of god which took over the first church first built by a lottery among presbyterians their small farm behind the hat shop gave deborah plenty to work with when strangers popped in for christmas galas the town's july 4th do or to throw a parade for the union army should it turn up which it did since april 1862 when her husband frederick died and the shop closed the town had been consoling mrs hamburg and her five children as they mourned waiting for the moment when joy could engulf her again here it was so uniontown answered her call to action unanimously as if the old hat shop roared into motion again children were dispatched to the fields to harvest whatever was ripe cows milked fatted calves readied every oven baked a pie bread or a cake the air over uniontown smelling like a bakery for miles around whiskey was suddenly everywhere the one tavern in town filled jugs from their barrels every porch rail along the main road studded with whiskey bottles spot where the second core would round a bend to enter town from union bridge bustled all afternoon as onlookers peered westward to catch the first glimpse of glinting steel from union rifles uniontown's eyes were about to see the glory of the coming of the lord and mrs hamburg felt alive for the first time since frederick died pillars of uniontown mr and mrs hamburg were convinced the railroad passed them by for westminster because of slavery that's where the money always went uniontown built by german immigrants watched over by a quaker lady of the town herself had no slaves and never would westminster on the other hand was plantation country a town where slaves were auctioned off sold onto railroad cars headed south frederick hamburg didn't even like going to the train station to pick up fur for his hats deborah hated when her husband rode into westminster that pile of rubbish she dubbed it the railroad remained an unhealed scab carbuncle onto this little corner of maryland and no one ever forgot it and whis and mrs hamburg needed no prodding to carry on about it which she did under the rising morning in the second quarter's camp you know you could have arrived here by train young man mrs hambrick barked at toby if this country had ever had half its wits about it the little girl smiled at toby knowingly toby winked back mrs hamburg carried on it's better this way his truth is marching on yes it is madame colville replied would you like some coffee no thank you colonel you know what they've been doing over there mrs hamburg continued waving her hand at the hills westward toby knew what they were doing over there so just busied himself with counting up eggs we have some idea madness lan and you men are all that stand between us and the devil himself the little girl already bored with the very familiar talkative grandmother routine whispered to toby that's my grandmother a fine lady toby answered she likes to talk the girl whispered further toby played along good a lot of folks here to talk to there's a ball tonight the little girl divulged toby returned his best surprise look a ball shh the little girl shush toby who's just right back with a wink now we're going to stop there and we're going to come back in our next episode about the ball but we will annotate this episode um as i mark the book with a book marker with discussion of this uniontown ball now i have written about this on my website quite a bit one of the things of many that attached me to this story and obsessed me with the first minnesota's charge and as it applies to leftists is uh this ball this welcome in union town um it has been lost in history um and we're gonna get a little granular here and not so leftist but uh the reason really is colonel colville who colonel colville does bear some responsibility for how this regiment has been forgotten buried it's it's it's mythic charge lost uh because colonel colville was a little bit absent-minded and it comes through in almost everything you see from him even before he joined uh the regiment after fort sumter and after the charge um i'm sure it got worse and there's evidence that it did and uh one of the historical confusions that you have to navigate about this story is this entry into uniontown uh by the second core of the army of the potomac um and the leftist angle is that again like the statue like the serpent uh monument the soldier stabbing a serpent with its with his bayonet um you see the dialectic uh [Music] in in in the decades and in the century and a half since um and the argument being between the two uh moving sides of history is that no no one would really welcome the union army into uh its village in northern northwestern maryland uh at the time uh there would not be such a welcome to an army uh such as the army of the potomac when in fact there was and uh there's enough evidence of it uh that it struck me that this was quite a welcome so the fiction part of this historical fiction book series uh can be found in how i describe that welcome now uh that welcome may have been a bit less than uh what i imagine but i imagine it was like paris and eight in 1944 uh when uh the uh allied armies uh liberated paris uh from the nazis it was one gigantic party and the evidence for that is in a couple of letters that i've been able to find from soldiers including one from the first minnesota patrick henry taylor's uh diary of the day mentions this and there's another letter or two from other soldiers and other regiments who [Music] note that uniontown was flowing with whiskey the day they were there that seems to indicate that this was quite a welcome so we will come back we will pick right back up with in the middle of chapter one there breakfast in uniontown for the ghosts of plum run our annotated audiobook only on midwestern marks i'm tim russo author of ghosts of plum run thanks for joining us
