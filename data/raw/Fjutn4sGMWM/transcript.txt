[Applause] [Music] [Music] where I could stand in the middle of Fifth Avenue and shoot somebody and I wouldn't lose any vter y like my African queen thing I got going on this is like the fourth hairstyle I didn't tried for this video listen would y'all believe me if I told y'all that I have spent months working on this video which is crazy because voting as an issue is not my thing I do not canvas for any parties or politicians I don't have no buttons no stickers no posters I don't donate to anybody and I have not made a dollar on the making of this video I will not make any money off of this video nobody asks me to make this video you'll notice you find no ads on this video or any of my videos as it stands and I say all that to you because a lot of people who are pushing things to you rev voting or anti voting are getting a check and they have an agenda and I am not getting a check but I do have an agenda and I want to be very transparent with you about what that agenda is if you know me already you probably know me from my work as a public defender in New York City and as an advocate for abolition bail reform notably in New York City in Illinois or for my general advocacy against policing and police brutality and for the black community and for other marginalized groups or maybe you know me for my writing or some viral clip or Raheem or maybe you discovered me for the first time right here on YouTube and if so I love that hey y all but how I Define myself is as a movement lawyer or a professional loudmouth as I usually say and it's what it sounds like I'm a lawyer who works in furtherance of movements and I do that by working with different communities organizations and individuals Nationwide to fight in favor of things they need like the pre-trial Fairness Act and solitary confinement act saving bail reform form and ending cash bail what's important to me is the liberation of black people which requires the liberation of all marginalized people and freedom from capitalism patriarchy and the prison industrial complex I work in furtherance of that goal the first thing that we need to understand today which I will expand on later in this video is that change is made by the people not the government and two all governments all governments are oppositional forces resisting change that's why we call our efforts a resistance so to do the work I do to do any work that's about changing the Status Quo the people must fight against the government who the government is has a lot to do with how difficult that fight will be the work I do how hard I have to fight shoots whether I'm able to fight at all has a lot to do with who's in office whether we have a Republican or Democrat Administration drastically impact whether I'm able to do the advocacy I do whether the movements that I support are able to pass laws or save the ones that we've already passed like the landmark bail reform that took effect in New York City in 20 or the pre-trial Fairness Act that was just implemented in Illinois after surviving a round of attacks from Republicans making Illinois the first state to abolish cash bail the increasing popular sentiment I see growing in my online spaces is that Democrats and Republicans are the same and thus voting doesn't matter or Worse the people shouldn't vote and that troubles me because of what the consequences of people believing that and acting accordingly would mean for the work I do and the goal I'm working towards listen to me and listen to me good in my o means heart and soul I don't give a personal about Joe Biden Ronda santz Donald Trump Maran Williamson Cornell West RFK or anybody else running for president I am not friends with any of them I don't campaign for none of them I don't donate to none of them and I'm not personally offended or moved by your support or disapproval for any of them I am indifferent about politicians and I see them all as the adversaries of of the people so I just want the weakest adversary in power unless and until they assert themselves as either a major threat or obstacle to my goals I want you to know right now specifically to the other commentators and media folk that will see this and want to make Angry videos and reactions on behalf of whatever politician they support or deem that I support baby I do not care okay I don't care about none of that and I am not going to respond I'm not going to be moved by it I put a lot of work into ensuring that I feel confident standing 10 toes down behind everything I say today so godp speed knock yourselves out okay so that's my agenda and the lens I'm shooting from today and a lot of what motivated me to embark on making this video which I'm thinking of as olay's election Survival Guide the other reason I embarked on this project was simply because people are often assuming and projecting a lot on to me R voting and they're usually real angry when they do it okay it's that football fandom thing where people engage with politics the way they would football and they be going dumb hard when you say anything because there are two sides it's the who are right and the who are wrong and baby if you're not the who are right then you are the who are wrong so what often happens is I criticize the Democrats and someone goes the Republicans are worse why don't you criticize them and I go yeah I know I know that and I do then someone else goes what the Democrats and the Republicans are the same you Li and then someone who thinks that they're so left they far right goes both of you are Li latte liberal hot take hot take straight from the the Democrats are works in the Republicans actually yes milk toast lips shill grifter tanky White deacy Puppets puppets and it's so funny because you'll be all those things to the same people like I am both I am both a Li and a tanky so I'm both I am both too moderate for the left and too extreme for the left depending on who you talk to you know what I'm saying I've been doing abortion rights I've been extremely online doing abortion rights for 11 years 11 years and all the same kinds of people calling me a Li now were the same kinds of people patting me on the head and saying oh row is fine it is a never- ending cycle of people being mad as about every Jesus little thing that usually devolves into people calling you a vote blue no matter who live if you haven't decided that one of the third party candidates is the answer we've all been waiting on which is funny to me for a few reasons because one that the people who think that they're some kind of revolutionary just supposed to you the shitl because they've decided to also put their faith in some politician or party to liberate them or radically change the system they're running to be a part of and listen I assure you that the real revolutionaries understand that no politician government or system actor is going to bring about your Liberation or do all or even most of what the people the people want done two I am not a US citizen so I can't even vote let let alone vote blue no matter who plus actual liberals would probably call me a radical extremist police haen and on most given days I'm probably criticizing the Democrats specifically my arch nemesis New York city mayor Eric Adams and his partner in evil Governor Cathy hokel I also get heat from folk who are anti-voting or voting for a third party candidate which confuses me a little because I've never blown down on either group generally I think if you can vote you should but that doesn't mean I have any real smoke for non voters you don't see me tweeting no Angry about how y'all are to blame for 2016 or something and listen I do not personally believe that any of the third party presidential runs are going to accomplish any of the things the people that are gun host supporting them believe that they will or that being gun ho Behind these campaigns is a productive use of your time for reasons that I'll flash out later but that does not mean that I believe anyone who is or wants to vote that way is wrong morally irreprehensible or my enemy I am fully capable of not sharing your sentiments on the topic of voting or not believing in your voting strategy or what you think will happen by abstaining or voting third party without that meaning that we are not both genuinely committed to the underlying motivation to get us to a less oppressed place okay so we're going to have a little bit of an editor's note in real time here from what I have here on my script because I was going to say I'm not going to lie to y'all my first in general internal response to people saying that voting doesn't matter that Democrats and Republicans are the same and to the people really dragging it saying Democrats are worse than Republicans is wow these wacka dooodle really think we're in the upside down but I actually have changed let me let me divert a little bit in real time from what I have on the script because I would not feel right having the same level I still am going to ultimately make an argu make the argument that Democrats and Republicans are not the same for my purposes or at least in substantive ways that I think do matter in terms of us as a left trying to get to a more Progressive place but I want to be clear that there are many ways that they are the same and I think that everything happening right now in terms of the US response to what's happening in Israel and um with Israel and Palestine and and Gaza I feel like it would be arrogance sheer arrogance and arrogance to come here with the same level of flippant disregard to the people think that Democrats and Republicans are the same okay so um I just want to be clear about that back to the script so my original that was why I came into this video my internal response was that's ridiculous but genuinely I saw those kind of arguments enough from people who follow me and people that like me that I wanted to at least try to be thoughtful and not just write off everyone without at least first picking the brains of people I respect and that Quest has revealed a lot to me that I'm going to share with y'all but what I really want to cement in our heads right out the gate that I think a lot of the other Talking Heads are not willing to say is that there is no one right answer take or strategy as it pertains to voting voting what candidate or party is better or what you should do voting wise depends entirely on who you are where you are how it impacts you what matters to you what you know and what you think you know I say who you are because voters are really malleable and hard to pinned down and I I I have this perspective because this is kind of how my family has always been like my family has always gone from Republican to Democrat uh and now back to you know being as left as I can make them because I will nag them until they they shut the about Republicans you know it always depends they kind of they go based on Vibes and narratives so like my dad he supported George HW Bush loved him and it was all because of the way that he handled the Panama War which he handled it like dog um but my dad liked it but then he hated Clinton because Clinton did welfare reform and my family relied on welfare at that time in particular uh but then my family supported Obama because Obama had a really good workingclass message and even though my family was socially conservative my dad in particular was really sensitive to any racist politics uh so he hated Donald Trump hated the a xenophobia that he saw from Donald Trump um liked Bernie Sanders because of the economic Pol so kind of like they they they're really mushy they go all over the place and I kind of like I take my family's political views and I project that onto the rest of the country uh you know for better or worse and these are folks that just like you have to try to meet them where they are and talk to them and you'll see that they're kind of all over the place and hard to pin down and the candidate who has the best narrative is I think going to be the one that prevails I say where you are because the entire election comes down to about six states and if you don't live in one of those Six States then you really don't you're not that much a part of the process so we shouldn't so so we have to make strategic decisions about where to invest our political capital and I say what you think you know because take for example rapper sexy red saying that she supports Donald Trump because she and other black people thought he was racist until he gave us stimulus checks do you think more people are going to support Trump now and or no yeah they support him in the Hood cuzz At first I don't think people was with him like they thought he was racist saying little and you know against women but once he started getting black people out of jail and giving people their free money oh baby we love Trump we need them back in office yeah that a little bit of free money goes a long way we need them back cuz baby them checks oh yes them stimulus checks Trump we miss you she supports Donald Trump because she thinks she knows that he gave the people stimulus checks what she doesn't know is that while we may have gotten those checks during Trump's Administration the Republicans voted against it every Republican voted against gsted and Democrats are who got us that money and because there are a lot of different ways to think about voting this election elections in general I just didn't think it would be valuable for this kind of video to only hear my perspective so I'm going to be offering my personal perspectives to the people who might find that valuable throughout this video intertwin with the perspectives of friends and mentors and people whose thought processes I value you and maybe some new and familiar faces to all of you because as one of those friends put it to me for some people the administrations do feel the same what I find with the Democratic party is that while we fight them on different things we're still fighting them tooth and nail my one of my biggest political lessons came from uh drug user activist Carl stubs um in 2016 when Trump was elected crying and I'm like oh my God the world's going to fall apart and you know this is a older black man who's been in you know dealing with the drug war for a really long time and he's like baby girl nothing changes for me and nothing ever changes for me my life has changed because I got student loan forgiveness I wasn't getting that under Trump right you know what I mean like I wasn't getting that from the conservative party but my life has diametrically changed because I no longer have this educational debt and for me I was like I don't care what you do thank you for that I'll see you in November you know what I'm saying my dad immigrant came into New York City did what the immigrants do they all pulled their their resources together they got a medallion they had a taxi the taxi business is gone you can't convince my dad to vote now because to him he feels like the Dems and the Republicans abandoned him right because his material conditions shifted because the most important thing to him his retirement his livelihood changed and he didn't get any nobody spoke to it so this is going to be a very long video but I promise that it's going to be a good one that I am really proud of y'all because I put a lot of effort into not just hearing my own thoughts reverberate off the walls and to try to hair think about and extract what I find valuable from the perspectives of many people who I respect and so with that in mind there are two things that I specifically want y'all to bear in mind as you watch this video one take what you find Value and discard the rest and two that someone's perspective is just that their perspective which is shaped by their identity their life experiences and where they stand in relation to what they're assessing so it is not always going to mirror your own and that does not make it innately bad or something that you need to fight or change or try to beat the person into submission about when you listen to what different people have to say about voting or really anything consider consider their vantage point the perspective that they're coming from so you can better understand their thought process and the context to see if there is anything valuable that you can take from it at all and to discard the rest one of the primary ways that I personally think through issues in my life is by talking to people whose opinions and perspectives I respect notice that I didn't say whose opinions and perspectives I share just respect and I pick their brains on topics and I really find so much grounding and how often I call someone up usually my Menor asde there's nothing wrong with someone running as a third party the question is what are you running why are you running and how is just part of a long-term strategy because you're not going to win tell him what I think about something and having him Blow Me Away with some perspective I hadn't thought of that doesn't usually invalidate what I'd initially thought it just provides me with an additional valuable thought that I hadn't considered because I likely couldn't consider it I don't sit at top the same Vantage Point as my mentor and vice versa this might come is a surprise to all of us but we are not capable of having thought about every issue from every perspective all by our Lonesome no matter how intelligent or thoughtful we think ourselves to be but this is critical to how I process information and derive value and Harmony and relationships with people that I have the benefit of learning from I take what I find valuable and I discard the rest and that is something sorely sorely sorely missing from the internet social media and the way these political audiences con consume information so many people are watching not to try to learn anything or to see if they're being offered something valuable they are watching to have their existing sentiments and perspectives echoed and when it's not they discard the entirety of what's said or they expect someone to push back or argue someone down where it isn't always necessary and listen I am not exempt from that I realized a few years ago that I had to pay extra attention to prevent Twitter from frying my brain I even remember the moment I realized it I think it was 2020 or 2021 and I was reading a book called why don't we Riot a black man in Trump Land by Isaac J Bailey an award-winning South Carolina journalist and it's a great book that I recommend you read and I recommend you follow Isaac but I was reading his book and I remember internally skinning up my face skinning up my face that's Gan for this some kind of skinning up my face not because he'd said anything wrong but because he was doing exactly what the he told me he was going to do in the title speak to the perspective of a black man in Trump plan living in the Bible Belt of America who interacted with Southern whites who grew up where he said the only two things that were prominent was Christian churches on every block and monuments honoring the people who fought to keep black people enslaved so that's a perspective that would obviously not be my own a black woman from the Bahamas who immigrated to America and practices law in New York City why would it be you goofy and it's me I'm the goofy  so I realized that social media more specifically Twitter had quietly changed how we consume information instead of trying to learn by taking what I could use and leaving the rest I was doing precisely the opposite I was trying to extract what I didn't like and leave the rest which is what quote tweeting is Twitter ratios and the stardom itself is made of and that's the opposite of how we learn or at least it's the opposite of how I was taught to learn as an academic and when I internally checked that my brain was frying like egg on a pan I was able to D so much value from Isaac's perspective and appreciate his work because I was allowing it to be his work rather than expecting it to embody Who I Am What I've experienced and what I believe and I shared that story because I really wanted to emphasize that because I talked to a lot of people whose perspectives I respect for this video because I have the benefit of knowing and having access to a lot of incredibly intelligent people who enlighten me all the time and I wanted to take advantage of that for your benefit my audience but I know I know that the minute I say I respect the perspectives of the people I included in my video some drama monger and unproductive clown pause the video to go through the list of everyone in the video to pick them apart or reduce them to something like a lib or a latte liberal or whatever the they be talking about and then they're going to go this is your queen is this your queen she respects such and such oh she's a liberal corporate dual Democrat hacker and it's me I'm your pure leftist Overlord and savior super in the basement but yeah but yeah so anyway this is me offering you those perspectives for you to take what you find valuable and discard the rest this is not a one-size fits all thing and it's unproductive for us to go into every voting discussion expecting everyone to share the exact same one right take in regard to voting elections and third parties when we are all coming at it from entirely different places with entirely different interests with entirely different things that matter to us so what I want to say to people out there out the gate is regardless of what I think about how you exercise your your choices I think you have a right to choice and I'm not going to be on your neck about it even if I can't endorse it personally in a representative democracy people have choice and I'm not just talking about reproductive choice because I know for some people that's where Choice stops they don't want people to have choice and thoughts about who they want to vote for whether it's federal state Regional or local now I might not rock with the person you want to vote for I might think is asinine as hell for you to vote for who you told me you want to vote for but it is not my place to tell you who to vote for now I can explain to you try to win you over to who I might be voting for if we had that kind of conversation but I'm not about to down you because you made a different choice and for that reason understand that I am not invested in shaming anyone into voting or shaming anyone for not voting and it's hard to shame people into voting I don't think shame people into voting works you can try and be like you better Vote or you know the country's effed that doesn't really work in in my experience so listen ultimately I'm glad that there seemed to be this disconnect between what I think about voting and all the people who want to beat my ass for thinking it's worthwhile because it made me want to make this video and it's provided me a great opportunity to tell youall a little about myself just so you could understand why I'm bothering to make it why I believe what I believe and so you can better determine whether it matters to you what I think whether my perspective is one you value at all because it might not be and to really fles up my thoughts and explore the importance and purpose of voting in federal and more importantly state and local elections whether our votes matter and the material differences between when black people and white people say that Democrats and Republicans are the same why people feel disenchanted with the Democrats voting third party how Republicans are successfully plummeting us into fascism anti-voting propaganda and how it's specifically being aimed at black people and you know just major issues that are impacting voters American voters like Supreme Court immigration the climate crisis lgbtq rights Reproductive Rights crime leing and more and I am not saying that I still don't think a whole lot of you are some wackadoodle for thinking voting matters is controversial I am just saying that I decided to go on a thoughtful intellectual exploration before I moved my internal commentary about y'all being wacka dooodle to the external I was reading and thinking about Marcus Garvey when it finally dawned on me how I could best articulate to you why I'm even bothering to be a proponent of voting when so many of you feel that voting doesn't matter or that abstaining from voting is the way to go Marcus Garvey said quote any sane man race or nation that desires Freedom must first of all think in terms of blood there can be no remission of sins then how in the name of God with history before us do we expect to redeem Africa without preparing ourselves some of us to die for over 300 years the white man has been our oppressor and he naturally is not going to liberate us to the higher Freedom the trer Liberty the trer Democracy we have to liberate ourselves end quote but he also cautioned quote mob violence and Injustice have never helped a race or a nation end quote what Garvey was saying is that he believe that black people would only be free when we freed ourselves when we accepted the inevitability of Bloodshed that some of us would have to die in war for us to free ourselves because that is what Every Other Nation or people who've ever freed themselves throughout history has done but he didn't expect that he would he also said quote the political Readjustment of the world means that those who are not sufficiently able not sufficiently prepared will be at the mercy of the organized classes for another one or 200 years and that told me something very important Marcus Garvey would not be surprised that where we black people find ourselves today just 83 years after his death he wholeheartedly believed that black people would only be free when we freed ourselves through organized violence and he thought that today's predicament would be likely in the next 100 or 200 years from the time he predicted it yet he never tried to organize us to violence and Lead that Revolution but he continued to educate write he founded organizations he inspired people he mobilized pan africanism and he engaged in political resistance in significant other ways but he didn't burn it all down and what I take from that is despite garvey's belief that there was only one true path to Freedom violent revolution it did not mean that he believed he was the person capable of carrying it out it did not make it his role to play he showed up in the ways that he could he used the tools that he could that were and continue to be valuable in our Collective struggle the way I see it there are two roads to be taken Revolution or Civic engagement unless I am prepared to advocate for violence pick up arms lose my life become a political prisoner and everything else that comes along with truly choosing Revolution and deciding you want to carry out some radical or violent overthrow of the government there is no reason for me to sit up here and present myself like some kind of revolutionary the real revolutionaries people like George Jackson who studied Guerilla Warfare and really tried to organize people died political prisoners lost brothers or Joshua Williams who was impr prisoned for eight years for setting a trash can on fire at a Ferguson protest in 2014 if you are not prepared to possibly face those kinds of outcomes please be terribly honest with yourself and resist the urge to cosplay as people who are really about that life you can still be incredibly valuable and transformative in the ways that you were meant to show up in the role meant for you and that's on the other Road the Civic engagement Road and if you choose to take that road the one that already isn't the one true genuine path to Freedom you have a million tools to try to change or resist oppressive systems and voting is but one but the least you can do is use or encourage the use of every tool at our disposal I'm like obviously I don't believe that voting is the end all be all cuz I can't even vote I obviously believe that there are other things that it needs to be voting and plus cuz you see me doing the End plus all year around that's what I'm doing to you all the time but if you the way I see it to me there are two paths there's Revolution you're going to go be a revolutionary and burn all down hey I got no bricks ex exactly and I our viewers don't got bricks oh yes so shut the fu up Cal down sorry everybody want to get up on stage and rah rah you know what I'm saying everybody want to be Shug night at at the source Awards but like nobody got the bricks that's what I'm saying and and and and you can't you shouldn't be getting your bricks from YouTube you know what I'm saying exactly so it's it's a lot of that yeah like do you think the real like if I'm like do you understand what comes along with being somebody that actually actually says they're going to burn it all down that person is not on your YouTube with colorful thumbnails and on your Twitter and yeah you you know uh shout out to I don't remember this dude's name I kind of don't like him but he right that's the best way I could describe him he done he's done a couple of videos somebody just tagged me in his newest one but his critiques are on point and one of the things he talks about in one of these videos he's like why does why did so many socialist movements end up in dictatorships and things like that right is he points out that there is a fundamental conflict between the people who end up leading socialist movements and the people they're leading and that the people who end up leading are almost always academics and Children of the petite bisi and there's this this ftiz of working regular people that makes it fundamentally impossible for them to to effectively organize with them and they end up being leaders because they have access to the to the um to the levers of power that put you in that position and then once they get there they can't handle or manage that uh that effectively and watch the video I don't know if you don't put the whole thing here because I probably bastardize this  but the point I'm getting to is that there is a the problem one of the problems about the visible left the visible very online because the thing you understand is that the left you don't see is the real left that's what I've been that is a conversation I've been having in general but the difference between the very what is a very black laugh in real life in terms of versus our online laugh to what is vocal right right the the real left is not going to be here on YouTube too tough they you know but the but the problem is the visible real left is very much a petite bgea um project and there is an inherent and I say this from experience there's an inherit inherent insecurity with the role we embody Within These Politics as part of the problem and those who will have to sacrifice uh our class position in order to to um realize the goals we we put we putting forth and so what happens is there's this this cosplaying of revolutionary there's people that want to prove that they're more radical and revolutionary than their class position dictates and what it ends up doing is invisibilize and marginalizing the real problems that regular people face regular people will be affected by a republican Administration versus a Democrat Administration yes period I I I think that people romanticized and sensationalized Revolution or romanticized sensationalized liberation and it's just like Hey listen man that All or Nothing idea you have is very parasitic and violent and dangerous to people you feel me it's like hey if if if we can acknowledge that the way in which you get food stamps the way in which the roads are hit the way in which your kids get old books or new books you feel me the way in which your community is policed all these usually come down to a question of voting I say that to say I know who I am and I need y'all to know who I am not it is cute to be a little dulu from time to time but but I think sometimes these internet Town squares need a reality check my name is oia muren and I am a movement lawyer political commentator writer a national advocate for abolition bail reform Black Liberation and other social justice movements and I believe in my heart that that is incredibly valuable work necessary work that I am proud of and it likely does make me a radical but it does not make me a revolutionary and that is okay that is not a knock to me man I'm going go engagement I'm go I'm going go I'm going to go on and say I think that there's been a concerted effort to demonize Civic engagement all the way around d man I would say in 2023 you just call Civic engagement or education around Civic engagement or trying to empower inspire people to be a part of the policymaking system or even learn policymaking you right here off as being woke oh you trying to do x y andz That's to me I think that's that's that's what it is cuz I'm I'm thinking about like man I'm I'm 32 years old I graduated high school in 2009 when Barack Obama won office or I or or people in my class became more politically astute I'll say when they started talking about George Bush taking away food stamps that's the first time I'm being real first time I thought paying attention paying attention I'm born and raised on food stamps so I'm thinking about how the gold post change it went for being like hey don't complain don't don't don't don't complain or talk about politics if you don't get involved and we seen record high numbers of black people getting involved and we' seen the gold post kind of change and making it where people get criminalized getting involved for me I look at it like this man if you know that I want to say I'm I'm try I'm trying to keep in mind what we talking at you know what I'm saying man Community guidelines we traded so listen if you know black people I W to say the N word but if you know black people three times more likely to go to jail you don't see a sheriff in your county jail the county sheriff is a elected position so if you know black people have the more likely a chance of going to jail and going to a County Jail uniquely don't you think we should should be able to pick you feel me even if you think they slave master colonizer you get to pick it exactly I ain't saying he's not going to be a colonizer pick pick the best colonizer you can find pick the best slate match you can find it does not negate though that this right here is going to be ran this way and recognize that a lot of places especially down south the sheriff don't even get don't even have no opponent I am big on self-awareness and I have never liked that we academics lawyers journalists YouTubers middle class and upper middle class petite bisi talented 10th ass feeling like we need to pretend to be something else that we need to posture like we the real in the trenches and adopt positions that are so senselessly privileged or harmful to who are actually in the trenches and I haven't seen more of that than what I've seen and how some folks are talking about this election so I want to speak quickly to a few arguments I'm not going to be breathing life into in this video and that's anti- voting SL voting is legitimizing the state accelerationism and breaking the corporate duopoly first anti- voting first of all when I say anti voting I am not talking about voter apathy or even so much individual people deciding they're not going to vote or that they can vote for one reason or the next that makes sense that makes sense I I understand people's frustration for off and I totally can like accept that especially like in the US like the the idea some people condescend others because they're like just vote why wouldn't you vote and like to me of course it takes me less than five minutes to do that in Canada in the US I'm seeing people like sometime Line 6 to 9 hours like that is a work day like I I'm I'm sorry make that a national holiday I know totally separate issue but I totally understand why people yeah disenfranchised with that very access it's like that I I just I literally can't I can't take that much time I'm off work to go do that or something like that so in that respect like I understand people's frustration and also to your point that yes it does seem that a lot of times both parties aren't representational of the people especially not from a lefter perspective like they're both uh at the end of the day furthering policies that benefit the very rich there there's no question no matter how you you separate the two and the idea of harm mitigation because that's what it is it's harm mitigation if you are simply trying to avoid a full-blown like you know barring towards fascists like Ronda santis or Donald Trump or something like that for NE neoliberal who furthers and expands poverty or incar incarc or or problems like that so so I understand the frustration deciding that you are personally not going to vote and having legitimate reasons for your personal disenchantment is a different thing from taking an anti-voting position encouraging others not to vote and worse presenting your personal decision not to vote as the one right thing to do or something that is going to move us closer towards any shared goal and to those making the general argument that voting legitimizes the state let me address that I mean it doesn't make sense at all and I read someone one of these Reddit threads is talking about when you're voting you're basically acquiescing to the state continuing to exist in this heterosexist you know capitalistic Society I'm like but like H 40% how what's the percentage of people who vote less than half so didn't if voting meant that You Were Somehow propping up the state then the few the the number of people who vote now should mean that the state would be steadily dissolving in some way or devolving but it's not it's getting more powerful H I tell you no one gets it I just it's frustrating and I read these Reddit threads and I can tell that some of the people who are writing read like white people right and so I automatically discount that because if you are a white person in this country and you're running around talking about I'm an anarchist Viva the revolution I'm sorry you there's nothing about the revolution that is really going to harm you meanwhile people that look like me people who are trans it's not it they will deaths deaths people will die there's literally an ongoing effort there's an ongoing anti-trans genocide like it's a genocide people think oh it's like just kind of cutesy you know everyone's calling everyone groomers and blah BL no they want people to not be trans when you are trying to erase people from the thing that they are that's genocide so I don't understand how you can look at this election and look at what's going on with these this wave of anti-trans bills that have been pouring out of state legislator and say I'm not going to vote cuz it doesn't matter literally do you have a trans friend look your trans friend in the eye and say it doesn't matter if I if I Vote or not now if you live in a state if we're talking only national elections right and if you live in a state that's like reliably blue or if then fine you know maybe vote because you're you're trying to vote for a third party maybe it'll help them you know maybe it'll raise interest in that party they'll be able to raise money like I get that but but if you're living in New York or you're living in California and you're telling people in Ohio and Florida and Wisconsin and Michigan that it doesn't matter that they vote what the are you smoking like I truly I can't I can't figure it out and what bothers me the most is that when I talk to the people who have these viewpoints they talk to me like I'm an yes right they talk to you like you're the one you're the lib that doesn't give a I'm like I'm a lib I've been called a  lib for so many years and it's like I've been doing abortion rights I've been extremely online doing abortion rights for 11 years 11 years and all the same kinds of people calling me a live now were the same kinds of people patting me on the head and saying oh row is fine like I remember that fearmongering about row stop fearmongering about the Supreme Court and now I'm like do you see what happened so but then when I bring that up when I bring abortion rights up well you know we lost abortion rights under under a Democrat where is Biden how come the Democrats didn't pass you cify row when they had super majorities in the Senate well number one how many times did they have super majorities in the Senate and number two did you care enough about abortion rights to push them to do and the answer to that question is absolutely not no you didn't you're using abortion rights you're using my main issue to attack me because I think it's important to still continue to vote and do other things right it's vote and not vote go to sleep vote take a nap it's vote and continue to do the mut the mut Mutual Aid the mutual Aid the the on the ground organizing the canvasing the you know the stop the cop City actions like there's so many things that are going on that people are doing and I respect that but if you're doing those things but then at the same time refusing to do the one thing that might actually benefit some people or at least block the harm that is hurling their way I don't know what to say to those people and even still my problem with the anti- voting message is very specific to when it's geared at the black community this en chanting black voters for so many reasons or the fact that it's always white people in my audience screaming at me to adopt this message to my black audience voting it isn't is extremely important and it has been especially in the black community for a long time and whether people want to realize or recognize this uh or or not it's just it's helped us along the way throughout the past several decades I have a white audience right like i' be trying to explain this to to people in my life the difference between I'm like you can have thousands of black people that follow you and are in your audience but that doesn't make your audience a black audience is the difference you know what's happening I have a white audience and I am hyper aware of it Dr Stevens and and and I take big issue I'm not an immigrant I can't even vote which also to me l l of perspective is like I've been living in American house since I was 14 I'm 30 now and I'm a lawyer I work in the courts I work in the system so I know deeply what it means to not be able to vote and recognizing how relevant it is and to be politically involved in AG so it's extra sick to me to have this white audience wanting me to push an anti- voting message and telling me it doesn't matter and and then I'm like I feel like I have to unpack that on so many levels because on one level when they say it doesn't matter it confuses me to hear a white person say their vote doesn't matter when you get what you want you know what I'm say like you were living you get what you want like we can't even have to me me and a white person a black person and a white person should not not be in conversation together when it comes to the my vote doesn't matter conversation cuz those even even in theory those are different worlds cuz you could understand a theoretical conversation from a black person on why my vote doesn't matter looking out at the state of the country the things that we've asked for the issues that we've been plagued for by Generation by generation you can understand intellectually why a black person might say my vote doesn't matter but a white person saying my vote doesn't matter is a different what are you what you not getting and I'm not saying that there aren't individual white people not getting what they want out of voting or from the government no in actuality white people and everybody everybody is being in this capitalist white supremacist system we live in especially working glass white people and the white leftists definitely want a different world than the ones their mothers fathers sisters brothers neighbors and significant others keep voting for sure but that's that's the point isn't it they get what they want as a collective you know from the black perspective what what what actually have we gotten you know B civil rights 64 civil rights uh 65 voting rights we we got those two respectively since then what has voting netted us we've put Bill Clinton into the White House we got the 94 crime Bill we put so when black folks say we're saying it based on a long track record of I mean we got free from slavery but we got free from Jim Crow a little bit but that's it um white folks when they say that I I look at it through the lens up but y'all got a lot already like I'm not saying there's no poor white people clearly there's a white working class and they deserve more just like the rest of us deserve more but they they do get one one of those groups of white folks get stuff Progressive white F bolks ain't get nothing I feel y'all solidarity workers of the World Unite but the y' cousins are getting exactly what they want every election cycle so you know when we say voting doesn't matter I look at it from a material perspective who's getting what black folks we always get the short end of the stick um but that doesn't mean we stop fighting white men and white women vote Republican and even when they're voting Democrat it's rarely for the Democrat they think will bring them change and usually the one who dresses up the status quo the best you get what you want as a collective so please pleas I mean this kindly shut the up and stop talking to the rest of us like we are in the same boat we are not and as a black woman let me just may may I say that as a as a black woman from a distance black folks better get out there to vote if don't nobody else vote because of what it took to get us to vote now I'm not saying just throw your vote anywhere cuz I'm not for that either I am not for that we need to be conscious minded voters and if people are not answering to our demands as black people let me just I'm going put everybody else in the parking lot for for a minute I'm going to come back and get them though I'm talking to black people right now let me explain something to everybody listening there is absolutely nothing the government spends hundreds of years actively trying to stop you from doing if doing it didn't matter let me explain something to everybody listening there is absolutely nothing the government spends hundreds of years actively trying to stop you from doing if doing it didn't matter when you see the pain Stak efforts these people go through to make sure that black votes don't count right the most nefarious one I'm seeing right now is being spread through um Instagram influencers and it's telling young black people to expect to get paid uh I heard young young black men say I'm not voting unless they pay me to vote and and and they argued it with a level of intensity as though they have been spending a lot of time on social media arguing this and and my thing is this like when you sit down and pause and think about where that talking point came from how it got laundered through black influencers on Instagram and now it is so pervasive that it's saturated down to some of our youth you really have to pause and say okay who has that kind of power to spread that kind of in misinformation with the express purposes of neutralizing our vote you know that doesn't just happen that's a concentrated effort of propaganda money and campaigning and influencing black influence yeah on inst so they are they are most certainly committed to making sure black folks don't vote but you know I get frustrated when I see a lot of these black operatives who use these n the narration like stuff hasn't changed for black people I'm like well which black people are you talking about because stuff act Ice Cube stuff changes for you because based on the tax law your life looks different and so you have different motivations to tell people to stop voting for this party right because there are certain material conditions that shift for you which make you go in a particular way let's do some math Congress passed the 15th amendment in 1870 granting black men the right to vote specifically because black men had been being turned away from polling stations systematically despite having been granted citizenship by the fourth amendment 2 years prior the story of black Americans begins with voter suppression that was 153 years ago following the passing of the 15th Amendment did they let black men vote peacefully no most of us know our country fought a civil war in the 1860s but less is known about what came afterward the chaotic exhilarating and ultimately devastating period known as reconstruction it was a moment of profound change with Promises of citizenship and equal rights for all one of the greatest achievements of reconstruction was granting black men the right to vote in 1867 alone over 80% of all the black men in the former Confederate states registered to vote 3 years later ham Rebels was elected the first black man to serve in the United States Senate and Joseph rainy became the first black United States Congressman their election paved the way for more than 2,000 black officeold who served at every level of government during Reconstruction there are not many moments in recorded human history where a group that was so subordinated would within the space of a decade actually be integrated into the highest echelons of political Society but the momentum wouldn't last black men's access to The Ballot Box along with other key rights gained during Reconstruction were rolled back systematically throughout the south in 1875 near the end of reconstruction the 44th Congress included seven black house members and the United States Senator by 1900 only one remained Congressman George Henry white of North Carolina by the time George H white leaves office in 1901 he literally turns the light off on national black political leadership no one will come behind him for an entire generation one of the cruel ironies of reconstruction is that black people could claim certain rights in the 1870s that they would have to fight to reclaim in the 1960s a sobering reminder that achievements thought permanent can be overturned and rights can never be taken for granted the supression of the black vote continues today in so many forms like Jerry mandering voter ID laws and it's not just black people that come for like this by the way the Idaho GOP just passed the law banding student idas as voter idas in order to go after Young Folks because they want to thwart the young Progressive voter turnout they saw last election from gen Z and the big one fell in disenfranchisement which is one of the big reasons for the intentional mass incarceration of black people in America about 2.3% a total of 5.3 million people of the American voting age population is disenfranchised because of these felony voter restriction laws that prevent people from voting if convicted of a crime and over onethird of these disenfranchised individuals are black and that's why it's different when a black person feels disenchanted with voting or feels that their vote doesn't matter I might not agree because I think that the Myriad of ways that the state goes out of its way to suppress the black vote to disenfranchise and disenchant the black voter is actually proof of how much our vote does matter and how much they fear the power of that vote but I understand completely why voting Rings Hollow to a lot of Black Folk experiencing that we give Almost 100% of our vote to the Democratic party and the question has to be asked what have you done for me lately to quote Sister Janet Jackson is it working for our people now I get and I know we're going to get into Neo Fascism and and Ne Neo fascism is an immediate threat and the Republicans today especially on the federal and state level have proven themselves to be Neo fascist no doubt about it Neo fascism kills you quick but neoliberalism kills you slowly and I had a mentor who used who used to say it doesn't matter whether or not you meant to kill me on accident or or or on purpose dead is dead that's the thing I've been thinking about right because on one hand I I believe I feel all the frustrations that people feel with the Democrats I feel frustrated with the concept of the fact that Democrats expect black people to go out and always be their strongest voter base to mobilize the most of that black women mobilize the most votes for them and do all of this and yet we are once they are in office after it's the you know the one article like oh thank black women then after that it is no need to to tend our needs and so I do feel frustrated with this concept of they don't have to it feels like they don't have to earn our vote because we don't have any other choice and but to that point it doesn't feel like we have any other choice if I'm honest because as much as I feel the frustrate the frustration with with the Democrats not doing more right not being enough against the stat stat quo the Republicans do strike me in my heart of hearts no matter how much I've tried to assess this and I've tried to see that they're the same thing um for weeks now I just can't seem to uh I I do see them as this is a fascist threat so then I think what are what are options what is the most tactical thing we do is is it to that people should vote third party I don't know and that's what I've been trying to get to the source of so what do you think you know I'm I'm right where you are Olay and probably where most people who are and the frustration is real I'm not going to dismiss people's frustration just because I am you know uh what I would call myself a Justice type Democrat I I get it I I still believe that's what the system wants to do it wants to grind everyday people to a halt so that you just continuously accept the lesser of the two evils there's going to and I was having this fascinating deep conversation with a dear girlfriend of mine who just echoed everything that you just did Olay like what choice do I have she asked I frustrated with the Democrats hell to the know will I vote for a republican especially the ones on the federal and I keep emphasizing fed federal and state level in particular you know what other choice do I have and I answered her this way from a tactical perspective we get it but there's always a choice and at some point black people especially because we give Almost 100% of our vote see our other sisters and brothers and family friends they'll tip out every now and then they'll go to the other side they let folks know they not playing with them but not us we save the Democrats each and every time and what really materially I'm asking systemically I'm asking do we have to show forward at some point black people are going to have to make a collective decision on a set of issues you know because we might not always agree some Democrats are rocking with neoliberals some Democrats are berats as you know hey some democrat some some uh black people excuse me you know vote for Trump I mean as as curious as I know that makes some people feel that is a very real reality some uh black people you know rock with the Clinton I get it but at some point our Blackness has to override any and all candidates that we may feel a finess or or closeness to and let me not leave out President Obama Obama they're Obama Obama ites too all of them out there every whatever how you rock but as black people at some point we got to agree on like a top three or something where that no candidate no party can shake us from it now when I bring in everybody else and when I mean everybody else I mean everybody else that is a working class person so black working class white working class Hispanic working class Asian working class uh Muslim or Arab excuse me working class everybody else in between at some point there's going to have to be a true working class solidarity in the way we vote too and I think the push by labor unions is one of the greatest and best for this moment Olay tactical models we have and I am saying that because the house of Labor rocking all kinds of ways when it comes the voting you got Republicans and you got Democrats and and however those people fall on the Spectrum but one one thing they do know is that they got to fight the man or the woman who has their feet on their neck when it comes to bargaining for better wages and work conditions and benefits and they coales together and they put all that other stuff aside we are going to have to do the same thing both as black people and as a workingclass people and one more thing on this point I do not believe that we can deal with class without dealing with cast they both go hand in hand in other words let me break this down for folks who want to understand what I'm saying that we cannot deal with the Grievances the very real grievances of Working Class People from all walks of life and leave race on the side leave antiblackness on the side because I guarantee you that every single issue animating the needs of working class started with anti-black hear me clearly anti-black racism in the United States of America because where you see a racist you see a sexist you know you see somebody that's homophobic all of those things go together and we cannot deny as a movement of people that antiblackness and and and and Liberation from it will shake aunder this country as it has done historically time and time again when black folks are liberated everybody liberated experienced everything because when you even taking it back to to to the voting doesn't matter or that comment or my vote doesn't matter it's like when a black person says that it's because I feel like I get nothing out of voting and when a white person says that it's because I feel like I'm supposed to get everything out of voting and those are two different things I'm like black people feeling like oh I I you were supposed to at least do the bare minimum for me and you are not providing that for me the bare minimum protections I'm still being killed by police my my communities are still being over policed I'm still being subjected to violence I'm still being impoverished you know bare minimum bare minimum bare minimum and I feel like you won't even you won't even rise to that whereas when you hear the white people it's it's that I haven't gotten everything it's supposed to be that should be the end of my involvement I should I should I should get everything that I want out of the politicians because it is their job to give me everything and that comes from a place of privilege and what it means to occupy the space of white in America and that's the short on why targeting black people in specific with anti voting messaging pisses me off moving on if you are not familiar with the accelerationist argument because you talk to reasonable people let me fill you in there are people who believe that we should let the country plummet into fascism let matters get worse let whatever happens happens let the Republicans win because people will then be forced to burn it all down vivaa Revolution my law school ex-boyfriend actually believe this silly I remember like it was yesterday picture it it's early 2016 and he was insisting that we need to let Trump win because that's what America quote deserves and people will blah blah blah blah blah and I remember his daddy looking at him and saying so basically you want to strap the country to the rails while the train comes that's what you want to do that's what you want to do that's what you want to do okay all right and that dummy did want that and that's what we got and did the revolution happen did the revolution happen or did it ins direction did the Democrats become the radical leftist you always dreamed or did they move further to the right as the obvious result of allowing a far right party to take over and gain more and more power and influence I have nobody in this video speaking to accelerationism because it's not a perspective I respect if you tell me in 2023 that you are okay with like or are unafraid of a reality where this country plummets into fascism you are not only announcing to me that you exist in so sever be a state of privilege that you will be unaffected by the consequences of a mother authoritarian regime where Republicans are trying to wipe marginalized groups off the map but you have the unmitigated arrogance to try to repackage that privilege as some kind of noble principled revolutionary position and I will not humor that and it's not because I'm some voice of the working class that I say that no no no precisely the opposite I'm a privileged  in many respects too not so many that a trump or disantis Administration wouldn't bring me to my knees because trust as someone at the mercy of USCIS that it would but I know just how privileged I am and just how much more privileged and insulated from the consequences of the The Talking Hands feeding you this accelerationist  are and that's a problem for me and I can sit here and say you know I'm a pretty privileged person yeah I'm black and I and I have all all of the baggage that comes with being black in America but I you know I could survive another Trump presidency I could and there are a lot of people quite frankly who are encouraging other people to vote who would Thrive under another Trump presidency right like their patreon subscriptions will go up they'll get more appearances on rumble or high-rising or whatever and it's like I wonder how many of these people actually believe what they're saying or if it's just like a money-making operation right like G cells like outrage cells and if you can spend four years being really really angry at Trump then you can you know you can get all the people embrace all the people who are also really really angry at Trump but what does that do we had four years of trump and nothing got burnt down except black communities right nothing got burnt down but trans rights where are all these white revolutionary why aren't they in the streets why the Republicans they're very clearly you know pushing a transgender uh attack and leading to an ongoing transgender genocide that's happening this country like you know more anti-trans bills have been introduced in the past you know two years than the entire preceding you know know history of this country let me ask you something right quick let me ask yall something do you think that these political commentators journalists and YouTube who all who all including the right-wing ones who constantly on Democrats living in their big liberal cities conveniently all live in those big liberal cities with Democrat administrations making way more bread than you not experiencing any of the  they make themselves the face of do you think those people are going to be the ones who can't access Healthcare gender affirming care education housing and everything else no they're not we're not I'm not and I need that privilege to be front and center in your minds when you hear them trying to tell you it doesn't make a difference whether the Dems or the Republicans are in office that they're not scared of trump all while talking this accelerationist moreover it's hard for me to understand how such a position could even be based in good faith when it's as bleeding nonsensical as it is arrogant because again we are living the proof that accelerationism does not work I be on that I cap I used to be on that  I I uh 2016 is one of them places and things I can be real real and real uh feel like transparent about I was a real radical for like I ain't vote for Obama I'm like I ain't voting I ain't vote for Hillary Clinton she probably going to get it anyway but I ain't voting I don't think nothing matter I was in grad school when when when when Hillary Clinton took the L the next day I went to class I had like three or four immigrant buddies that I really rock with they come to school they one of them a dude he he's distraught feel me he don't know he usually all chipper and he distraught the other two you know what I'm saying two two women they crying one them been saving the money to go back home for for Christmas for two two or three Summers now she don't even know she already bought a ticket too she already paid the bread but she already recognized like the Muslim band and already went down and this that and the other so if I go I can't do this I seen how much it impacted this presidential election impacted so much and I feel like hey if you really say you about what you're being about you have been selfish for specifically two elections that's had a big implication had a big material impact on how they live their lives so you thought it would be cool thought you was on some Pro black to be like n rock this and this be real I I I haven't thought about it like realistically I'm in Oklahoma you feel me um Oklahoma was was was going to go red anyway but I don't think that it's enough for me to ethically be like well like n ain't good enough so like that that that make CU us I person like I forget presidential elections all about local elections blah blah blah now Hey listen I was in office when they overturn three four five we seen I didn't man you made a video about overturn this and overturn this and overturn that that came from one president having a little bit too much power to be able to get some Congress people in them up so it's like listen man in 4 years he appointed more Congress people than these did in 16 years years Obama did eight but Bush did eight they only get what three people I think they appointed three yep yep appointed four yes yes you know I've gone through I covered 2016 I covered 2020 I'm going to cover 2024 what I one of the big arguments that were absolutely dispelled after 2016 is the idea that oh if if Hillary loses in 2016 well the Democratic party will learn its lesson and then they will speak to the issues of the left and they will speak to real workingclass issues that didn't happen because the Democratic party does not care the Democratic party as it currently sits as a capitalist organization they care about what the leadership cares about so there is no teaching the party a lesson they they will simply turn around and even if it isn't the left's fault they will blame the left for losing and they won't do anything to actually try to appeal to them so that you know that point often makes people think well then why would I vote for them because they hate me but it's because voting is a tool voting isn't voting for you know all your hopes and dreams and there is no perfect candidate but back to the break the corporate dooi argument I keep seeing over and over again online but never in real life what the you would have break the corporate duopoly even if it means Republicans would we broke the duopoly what the you think that's what regular people vote they don't even know what the that means the average voter would even know what that means you mean cor do I believe which of these gonna cut my services which of these Gonna going to cut police funding which of these is going to um illegalize TR my my gender identity you know what I'm saying like it's I'm not worried about none of that  in Atlanta I am scared I'm lowkey scared of the police out here right now yeah scared it used to be because I cuz I had some I heard some things so we gonna see but generally speaking I'm not scared of the police like my former students are like my cousins have been in Chicago I'm not scared of Street crime like my former students are like some of my homies in other parts of the city or in Chicago um I'm not scared of being M it being coming illegal to be straight you know what I'm saying I'm not scared of most of the things that are tangibly affected I don't have a uterus you know what I'm saying like I'm not worried about those things and so voting is not going to start the revolution it's not going to enact the the policy changes that I want to see in all by itself but it it it is going to clean some germs off my hands after I take a and I don't know how that's going to play but like I want you to put that in and I will and I will F and I will do that for you and that's how I feel about people that don't vote I'll be like oh you don't wash your hands look me in my eye look me in my eye you cannot tell me your goal is to break the corporate dapoli by having one of the two parties in the dapoli win that's not breaking the dapoli that's literally how it functions that's how the two- party system works getting Republicans in office does not break the corporate dapoli it gets us a republican Administration that is it and that is all if you imagine only real choices are only Republicans and Democrats I don't know who the you think you're showing who's boss by selecting one of those choices and the worst one at that and the worst one at that and if you think Democrats are worse than Republicans your marbles have just obviously left the chat and so should you bye bye you can want to break the corporate duopoly sure that's valid that's fair that's whatever but I can engage this continued posturing that it's the average American voter's agenda by people lose clear and transparent goals that to support the Republican party or iron out some personal grievance with the Democrats enough enough when I say that the average voter doesn't know what the you're talking about when you say break the corporate duopoly I'm not just saying that because a voter might not be familiar with a particular terminology that it means they don't care about something but what I'm saying is that simply does not get to the heart of what voters need or care about I always feel like we need to address people's fundamental needs first food clothing and shelter we need jobs we need living wage jobs immediately yeah under Trump things were bad under Biden they're a little bit better but there's still not where they need to be I think that's what people are thinking about right now how can I eat how can I survive how can I pay my bills people want to live lives of dignity and safety I think our education system has to get better I don't know if that's at the top of people's list cuz again I can't talk about even like what's in the curriculum if I haven't eaten yet yeah as they watch the attack on critical race Theory history books gender race you know checking out they're literally trying to control they're trying to cage our minds we have to resist that we don't just need to go back to the days of BU or keep the dates bi or Obama we need to go beyond that we need to normalize a kind of abolitionist future and while the average person in the hood may not be using the language of abolition they know that they wish you know their family members weren't sitting in in in in jail yeah you know with with a million dollar on their head or or or $500,000 bail on their head that they can't afford to get out even with Bond they know they don't want to they know they're afraid of police you know um now they're also afraid of right like I mean keeping it a 100 right like they're also afraid that when they walk down the street they're going to get robbed so so how do we address that by addressing poverty by addressing unemployment by addressing education by by by getting at the things that produce criminality if you're someone who really follows me and watches my stuff throughout the years you probably already know that I have a pension for reminding everyone that Audrey lord said there are no new pains just new ways to make things felt and that's something I remind myself of often that everything we're experiencing today the generations before us were too everything we battled they battled too which means every position in today's war was available in yesterday's War so please understand that the position you play today is the position you would have played the same roles are available so babe if today your only contribution to the movement is tweeting angrily at me that we need to burn it all down not vote you are in fact not a burning it all down just like you would not have been in yesterday's War you are doing what you would be doing in the movement please understand that the burn it all down got it cracking for real the light the cops up really do that so if that's not what you're doing that is not what you do and that is okay that is okay please Divorce Yourself from this idea that you need to liken yourself to revolutionaries or posture as anything other than people who care who are doing their best and who are trying to do their best with what they're capable of and the tools that they have you do not need to cosplay like revolutionaries you don't need to posture you don't need to perpetuate like you the getting it out the mud like Marcus Garvey like you I am not the burning it all down and that's not a slight to Garvey me or you but like Garvey if you believe that the one true path to Freedom is a path you yourself are not able to pursue you must obviously use as many other tools as possible at your disposal with the knowledge that none of them individually can bring about your Liberation but that they can collectively move you closer but more important at the fact that none of these tools by themselves can bring about your Liberation is remembering that no government Administration ever will to be frankly you know this this term that they're coming up with and trying to use some connotated meanings that we use in Black America to say woke is something negative but guess what I'd rather be woke than sleep I talk to everybody in their mama to find out how they felt about voting how something that seems so innocuous to me like if you can vote you should became controversial like why is so much ey or at least what's the disconnect why don't I feel the same ey I figur out why I agree with folk that the Democrats don't do what we want them to do and that pisses me the off yet I still don't feel disappointed shocked or that people shouldn't Vote or shouldn't vote for them the three reason a lot of people feel disenchanted with the idea of voting is because one they feel like they're being sold the idea that if they vote something will change and nothing does two they think the government is supposed to bring about radical change and last but certainly not least they think who they vote for is supposed to reflect them say something about them that it's representative of who they are and everything they believe but that is not what I am selling nor what I think anybody should be selling about voting the government any government meaning any political Administration is an operational Force maintaining the status quo or the society as it knows it the people's desire is to change the status quo if the people's desire is to change the status quo that operational force will act as a blockade from that change they are a force that will fight against the people that's the point that operational force is never there to help bring about the change the people are trying to see that's why we call our efforts as a people of resistance we are resisting the force that is the government so for me the frustration with voting comes from the expectation that the administration is going to upheave or radically change the system that empowers it and that doesn't make sense it's the antithesis of what the government is there to do the government doesn't create change the people do I get the frustration that people are having because they're as you laid out material need needs are not being met by either party and I surmise that neither major party is answering to the needs of the people so folks might say well Senator Turner you still a Democrat yes I am I am still a Democrat because I'm still fighting you know because we only have two major parties right now and you got to be able to L it's tactical more than anything I want people to understand that yes to answer your question directly while I went all around the block voting is still a relevant tool but notice how I said it is one of many tools it is not the only tool it will not come and save us immediately there are other things that we conscious minded people should be doing in and around and before elections because election is the last it's the last leg of of the of the race it's not the first leg we got to be out there agitating we got to agitate aggravate push forward the things that we want to see elected officials do we have to organize you know Micha o render AKA Killer Mike a dear friend of M he has a sand that I think fits for anybody that's in organizing and it's plan plot organize strategize and mobilized that is what we must be doing at all times voting in and of itself is not going to be the thing that gets us there we got to do the other things in and around it and we have to be engaged as a community Beyond just Federal politics who's in the state houses and Governor's Mansions matter who's on the regional level or what we would call the county level of government matters who's on school boards matter and who serves on the on the local levels of government matter so when people say the off-ear election as far as I'm concerned there is no year that's off because every single year no matter where you live there are either issues on the ballot or there's somebody body on the ballot who sits in the Judiciary matters too so we got to be on and popping all every Administration is going to be the adversary of the people the oppositional Force we have to try to move or fight through so you vote for the outcome easiest for you to fight and as someone on the left I can fight the Democrats but I we have absolutely no ability to fight or push the Republicans Republicans don't care if we oppose their agenda or don't approve of what they're doing they do care actually cuz they love it when we oppose what they're doing you cannot pressure a someone as someone who's an activist on the left you cannot pressure somebody who is a republican so you know that's and that goes to all the potential energy wasted during the four years of trump like all the potential pressure that could have been on Hillary for other things were spent on hoping Trump doesn't steal the next election like was just the focus is completely off of anything material because you can't expect a Republican president and the party controlling Congress to do anything for your life so it's all about you know trying to uh prevent just how bad what they're going to do is which you can argue in some ways is also when Democrats are in power too but it's still it's it's to much different degrees and people also I think get get caught up in this idea that oh if I vote for this person then then I can't complain which is I I don't know who thought this idea up but that's ridiculous like no just because you voted for say Kathy hoel or hokel whatever her name is just because you voted for her doesn't mean you now have to support everything she does no you you get to criticize you get to push you get to pressure in however way whoever's in power whoever you want because but the difference being with a democrat in power there is more of a a potential there to actually have some impact because it is a democratic uh politician and they they have to worry about losing some votes from some people so they have to speak to some of those issues some of those groups that otherwise a republican would not be caring about at all it's so the the thing that I'm sure you're going to get in this video is that we are working against our own best interests by keeping them in power and to me that fundamentally Mis understands the nature of power yeah we are not keeping them in power right we are the only check on the power they actually get from all these other institutions systems uh that we suffer under so we don't keep them like they're going to be there regardless or somebody worse is going to be there that we can't check at all although this election is probably a little bit different because I think this is going to come down to Trump versus Biden probably and if that's the case I think that a lot of Voters particularly liberals and lefties are going to see that this is more about democracy than anything else like this is kind of make or break like to me I'm not going to vote for Joe Biden because I think that he is going to uh do anything about my student loan debt or expand Healthcare at all I'm voting for him because he's not Donald Trump and I think that that really matters even if I know that he's not going to like benefit me in any way shape or form politically speaking and I know that I can't really push him left I'm voting for him because he's not Trump it's as simple as that yeah so I feel like I have the best take on this nobody nobody nobody's gonna be better than what I'm about to give you right here right vote like you wash your hands the same energy that when you take a or you or you or you play you outside or you you've been doing something right you wash your hands you don't wash your hands cuz you like to you don't wash your hands to keep you from getting shot or keep you from getting cancer or anything like that you wash your hands cuz it's a basic minimal thing you can do to lower the risk of catching some yeah yes yes and like the thing the thing that I think people struggle with is they want we've been taught voting is like this bigger more profound thing that we are we are who we vote for we identify what the party we represent we wear the colors we fly the flags and and like I get it I was there like 2008 FD had had the Hope shirt had to pick o was playing will I am you know what I'm saying I was in there and then 2012 FD was like ah it don't make it don't make that much [Laughter] difference you know what I'm saying especially so like if I if I didn't live in Georgia yeah I might vote for uh coner West I might vote for insert random here that's not doesn't have a real chance as a as a personal statement or as a as a branding strategy or some yeah I live I live in a low-key swing state yeah vote for I'm G vote for Joe piden yeah I'mma do it you know why cuz I took a you know what I'm saying it's like it don't really mean it don't got to mean so much like folks and it's and it's really it's really a bigger thing on how um cooked leftist politics are from a prag from a practice pragmatic St yeah that we can have like this video might do numbers you know why because mother woo they love you know posturing about their leftist identity um through meaningless um through meaningless like shows of protest and whatever because voting is a tool voting isn't voting for you know all your hopes and dreams and there is no perfect candidate you're always going to compromise no matter who the candidate is there is no perfect person for you unless you're voting for yourself you there is no perfect candidate for your for for you so because of that because of the fact there's always a compromise you're always voting based on what the context of the situation is so when it comes to a voting for a president I think in most cases at least in modern time you're voting essentially against the other side you're in in the case you know against uh Trump or any other uh Republican you're voting against Fascism and the real Focus you have to make is on the down ballot races so you know because there will be some better choices down the ballot where there are going to be candidates that maybe appeal to you a little more uh that do speak to your issues but just because every single candidate on that ballot isn't you know you doesn't mean you shouldn't vote it means you have to change how how you think about voting depending on the context of what you're voting in and which is why I think voting it it's it's like there are so many layers to this because it's important to also point out that you know voting isn't everything it there is in terms of actual changes in society I think the most important thing is the power of people so we're talking about you know unions activists I think that's where a lot of the real change happens it's from the ground up voting is simply one of the ways that the masses can interact with Society it a tool in the tool set it should be one of the things that you focus on at one point in the year like the problem with us to is it's in a Perpetual election cycle like both in the media and just the way that yall treat it right it's always talking about elections getting ready who's the next you know Warrior who's going to go up against the all this kind of stuff right where at the end of the day like if you are concerned about making I i' say material change for people's lives that has to be one part of it that's one element of it that has to be like again there's not going to be a light switch there's not there's not going to be a flip and you'll always be disappointed in this process if you feel that way cuz like that's why I think so people online are obsessed with AOC to an almost like weird verted level but it's just like it's everything she says and everything she does and whether the worst thing in the world or the best thing in the world or this or that it's like this this is one it's one politician who has a megaphone and should use it and don't get me wrong please push your politicians to be better all the time right call them out for sure but she cannot turn on socialism right her alone why hyper focus on this one individual whereas you should be focusing on so many more things the road like please go do direct action go join an organization go volunteer for food not bombs or or join like an lgbtq plus org in your area because you'll find like at the end of the day you'll feel so much better about a lot of this as well PE gang I'm an educator I come from an education background uh the school funding it's all predicated off of taxes of where you at property taxes we know that right we also know you know what I'm saying like hey like like if if you believe your kid should receive a high quality education in the classroom you worried about funding you worried about how teachers being taken care of or the curriculum who's the superintendent all these things all these things controled by voting at the same time though well look it's I'm not saying that don't matter that that voting is irrelevant or all of that but and there are many other criteria you know the there's the the growing climate emergency there's foreign policy issues there's there's broader kinds of economic justice issues and so people need to consider a full range of things you know we don't typically vote for someone based on just one single issue litmus test do I spend my time on get out the vote efforts endlessly messaging about how bad Dan santis or Trump are or do I spend my limited political Capital trying to build up organizations and communities that are fighting very local battles in very concrete ways that are changing people's minds about what is possible what it might look like um and so my feeling is in this moment that's that's really where I put my energy sometimes that does mean uh backing a local candidate for office which I have done around the country for for all kinds of different offices if I think that person is in sync with a local movement is an expression of that movement and it's going to advance a movement agenda yeah but just you know picking the least worst person in every race just to do it uh I don't I don't think that's a good use of our energy you are always going to be stuck in a D in the US there's always only going to be a two-party system right and that two-party system is clearly not benefiting the people so I see where obviously the fundamental frustration comes from that um and it's really hard to break through that it on on one end you do have people like the squad for example they're trying to become this new uh more VOC Progressive wing of the Democrats and then use their power to be able to influence either legislation uh or or some other form of like you know political power soft power whatever you want to call it uh and then you got people really really mad at that for them even existing because like you cannot possibly win when there's the corporate D of of the Democrats and the Republicans I I think people need to accept sometimes that like you don't have to vote for Joe Biden because you like Joe Biden hate Joe Biden I think Joe Biden is a massive and has a career in politics where he has shown himself to be a racist to be an be homophobe like all of these people Les lest we forget they didn't just turn like I'm Pro lgbtq Plus switch right like Hillary Clinton was again against same marriage she still says Turf talking points all the time right but the alternative to that on the other end is the Donald Trumps is the is the Ronda santis who like literally don't want trans people to exist right so I I like it sucks if I was an American I would begrudgingly Say Yeah Joe Biden if I was in a purple state by the way if I was in a blue State whatever uh then give your vote to Cornell give your vote to you know a third party that you care about um but that that's just the reality of the shitty that's why I keep saying that can't be the all like the sum total of change or what you think will enact change cuz cuz again you could have a more Progressive president than Joe Biden that's not going to end a lot of the inequality under capitalism that's not going to suddenly end all mass incarceration disproportionate incarceration marginalized communities right like it's not just going to be a switch I would love to be that case but like some people get so invested especially if they're online all the time in that Dynamic like if we just voted for this person we could unlock socialism overnight or something like that when it's like that that should be one tool in the tool set of the rest of your activism or or whatever you want to call it I imagine that even the people who are anti-voting would probably at least agree that voting is a tool so I imagine their position would be that voting is a meaningful tool in the fight for Liberation or whatever more Progressive world we want to see and I just can't get down with that point either for it to be true that voting doesn't matter as it pertains to our fight for Liberation it would have to be true that the results of the US 2024 presidential election have no bearing on that fight but that is simply not true at all first of all all US presidential elections have major implications not just for Americans but for the rest of the world there's a reason why some of your favorite political commentators on us politics aren't even American think about that second the results of this particular US presidential election matter because there is no Liberation where there is fascism let me say that for you one more again there is no Liberation where there is fascism and you know like when you talk about the Supreme Court all people I'm sorry but all people had to do was vote for Hillary Clinton and we'd still have row like I'm scor abortion activists worked so goddamn hard in the runup to the 2016 election to get Hillary Clinton to move left on abortion rights because she was one of those you know rare safe rare and whatever the stupid phrases you know legal safe and rare but Rarity is not we we're doing away with Rarity because we're not stigmatizing people who get abortions for whatever reason and also we we got a commitment from her well not me personally but other um people in the movement got a commitment from her to to do away with the height Amendment they got that same commitment from Biden and Biden tried but ultimately Republicans blocked it but that was a huge deal 2016 was the first year that we got that you know the movement got a presidential candidate to agree to to tell hiy to go itself so it matters and so what did we get a six 63 Court a 63 Court we wouldn't have that and so instead of I don't know instead of reflecting upon how it was we got there and I did reflecting myself because I was one of those people that thought Hillary was a shoe in right and so by my money I spent a lot of times being like n Hillary me Hillary I don't really like her that much like as a black woman her feminism doesn't really speak to me y yada and I'm wondering you know should I have should I have pushed for her harder once it was clear that she was the nominee because in the primary I was like I don't care about Hillary Clinton but then once she was the nominee yeah I'm voting for Hillary Clinton but even after I said that after she' already won people were talking to me like I was an  for saying that I was going to vote for this woman when she was the Democratic nominee and so I think if people would reflect how Blas they were about the election in 2016 I was too I think a lot of us were because I mean who the really thought this Carnival Barker was really going to get in the presidency I mean at in the initial stages right I just want people to reflect on their behavior and then not repeat those mistakes because seven years is a long time and people have forgotten like they have all on forgotten what it was like yes and and I think that's problematic and I want to be clear here I think voting is a tool and it's important to use that tool prag Al and in recognizing that I do recognize that what's pragmatic for one person is not necessarily pragmatic for the next person it is your choice how you exercise that tool if that means supporting any of the third party candidates that's fine by me for the reasons just stated but I want to add for the people worrying that third party candidates are going to cause the Republicans to win they're they're definitely not that's no no they're not I ran as a green Party candidate back in 2015 in in in Canada so I'm very aware that when it comes to Green Party voters most of those people aren't going to vote unless there's a green Party candidate like the there is very little poll I find from other parties into the green party it's basically a party where you know a lot of the activists vote a lot of people who who just they want to feel like they're engaged in some way but they wouldn't vote otherwise that's where a lot of that vote is further if any of these candidates between Cornell West marann Williamson or RFK are spoiler candidates it's RFK and he's going to take votes away from Trump or Dan santis depending on which one gets the Nom so good good we like that neither Cornell West or Marian Williamson are going to get enough of the vote anywhere let alone anywhere that matters to hurt the Dems they're just not they're just not I am the type of person politically that in a representative democracy people have choice and I'm not just talking about reproductive choice because I know for some people that's where Choice stops they don't want people to have choice and thoughts about who they want to vote for whether it's federal state Regional or local now I might not rock with the person you want to vote for I might think it's asinine as hell for you to vote for who you told me you want to vote for but it is not my place to tell you who to vote for now I can explain to you try to win you over to who I might be voting for if we had that kind of conversation but I'm not about to down you because you made a different choice and so so if I truly believe in choice in all of its forms then that's what it is people have a right and and you shame on these people who want to try to bully people into voting one way or the other hell you want to vote green vote green anybody that's running on the ballot no matter how they're running they got to earn the vote they not owed the vote and that's what makes me sick to my absolute stomach that folks think that they own other people's votes you do not sir you do not ma'am you you do not family a friend member you don't own nobody's vote you got to earn it so you know what I'm glad that Dr Cornell West is running on the green party yeah shake them all up Dr West I'm glad that Maryann Williamson and Robert F Kennedy Jr had enough courage and gumption to challenge this current president or if it was any other president because a primary is supposed to be about the the batter the battering about of the bantering about about ideas supposed to be a conversation it is very true that I am a a student and fan of Cornell West I consider him to be a mentor at a distance I've never actually set underneath him but I've read just about anything that he's written I listen to his lectures much respect and admiration for him the green party has never gotten more than 1% in a presidential election the green party love them love what they stand for but you don't hear from them somebody show me where we heard from them over the last four years yes doing the groundwork necessary to actually get more than 1% um that's why I can't vote for the green party even though they do have one of my favorite people in the world Cornell West on their ticket but I need to give my vote me personally people do what they want to do right I think it's incumbent upon the Democratic party to go and earn every vote right I don't think anyone should be vote shamed per se whatever that actually means I'm going to say what I think for me personally and that is I'm going to vote to stop Fascism and I don't think the green party can pull that off there's no doubt that Cornell W is a brilliant scholar has made significant intellectual contributions in uh American higher education and American society not that I agree with everything that Cornell West says uh I do think Cornell West is voice is important right because I think you know when you hear different voices different opinions that people The Listener is able to digest and uh uh uh evaluate that right and so this fear that we hear from the poly uh the party politicians or Allies or supporters is especially on the Democratic party is they going to take votes away from uh uh Joe Biden whereas I see this a little different if Cornell West makes it to the stage you know just like when KLA Harris uh was on stage with Joe Biden and Democratic candidates vying for the presidency she challenged Joe she challenged Joe and what she challenged Joe on with some uh some uh devils in his pth on on issues that he voted for uh and ultimately because she challenged him he grew from that and that's why she became his vice president so I think that you know what now west will do is raise some issues that we might hear we might not hear from other candidates you know uh in the arena for a Vine for president and that's a good thing the bad thing is that we're at such a critical moment in American history where there are a lot of Voters that feel we can't have another repeat of what happened uh from 216 to 220 right so you know it's like uh there's some risk in all of this but what's important most important is for Americans to be informed and not to close their eyes or you know have blind be blind to real issues and say I'm tired of hearing this blah blah blah blah right come on we should listen and hear what's going on and make good decisions on the basis of that and go once again go for the lesser of the two evils choice is important and votes do have to be earned so I'll never be innately against people supporting third parties like the green party or candidates like Cornell West or Marian Williamson but I think it's important to explore why you're making that choice how pragmatic or realistic it may or may not be or how it advances your bottom line your bottom line you know I came up as an activist I came up in a radical tradition you know reading studying organizing and I believed that I needed to be part of a political movement political party that represented my actual beliefs yeah and I hoped that at some point this party would grow and be successful you know that at some point the party would grow in such a way that we could be really competitive in national elections maybe even defeat the Democratic party just the way politics Works in a representative democracy um with you know this sort of two- party system it wasn't like there was going to be a three lanes and all three were going to be competing competing but what I hoped sort of somewhat anacronismo and so forth and so on so I'm saying that to say that was my hope um and so I voted for green party candidates in presidential elections and I continue to represent green because want to continue to represent the issues every time the green party comes out it's an opportunity to fight for these issues not for a candidate for these issues we don't go into presidential elections thinking we're going to win you know I didn't vote for Jill Stein because I thought she was going to be president I voted for Jill Stein because I thought the issues that Jill Stein raised needed to be raised yeah um and so um over time I look at it a little different one I think that third parties are really important for local elections we can't just think about the the presidential election like we can't win for president but we can win for mayor city council all that stuff right we can win those seats if we organize the people and that's how you build a movement so now we have Green Party politics throughout our Grassroots and so now at the state level we we start fighting right and and now Democrats are going to have to make concessions so that people don't keep voting green they're you know what we'll stop cash bail you know what you know what I mean we'll change the tax Cod cuz these greens are winning and they're doing it yeah so that has to be kind of how we approach the state um for national elections um I continue to represent green um but the first time that I did not vote for green party presidential candidate was uh 20 uh 24 yeah voted I voted for Joe Biden yeah um and it was a tough thing voting for Joe I had to hold my nose when I went into the polls I saw Too Much Death I saw too much destruction I saw Too Much disillusionment from the people yeah and as a person of Rel relative privilege I I felt like it was my duty to do something it's everybody's duty but I felt like how dare I you know sit here able to still pay my bills and under Trump maybe even have fewer bills to pay you know um while while people die yeah I I can't let voting become an exercise of my personal politics or a demonstration of my ideological purity so that I so that I can say well I I I H I stay 10 toes green while the world is on fire yall say I look different here right that's proof of the months and months it's taken for this video to be made and to come out and it's really because of this part right here addressing the Democrats and Republicans of the same argument because I know that so much of my online audience says and believes this and expects me or anyone they consider a real leftist to share these sentiments or they get in incredibly angry about it and they question your character your intentions and your commitments so I have spent months trying to twist myself into knots trying to see where they're coming from why I don't quite agree or how I can speak on this without invoking people's rage and that became an even bigger obstacle once October 7th happened and more people became aware of the United States longtime involvement and support of Israel's occupation and subjugation of the Palestinian people now turned genocide by the definition of the United Nations and you know human decency but that's when it became an obstacle because that's when it felt like my entire audience turned to Blind don't vote or don't vote for Biden rage and started attacking any and everyone who still thought voting was even a worthwhile conversation to have let alone voting for Biden or the Democrats to a lot of people it became impossible to make a lesser of two evils or harm reduction argument or to distinguish between the threat the Republicans pose and the Democrats once Joe Biden was seen as funding a genocide side of the Palestinian people and I don't quite share all of those sentiments because if I'm honest nothing has changed with respect to the reasons I believe that Joe Biden or whoever the Democratic nomination could ever hypothetically be is the weaker adversary between they and Donald Trump and the reasons why I think we're still in a much better spot if we have to fight them versus having to fight Donald Trump and maybe that's a better way to look at it instead of the lesser of two evils or the better option let's think of it as the weaker adversary the easiest person to defeat but the viability of that choice has changed I talked about this in my Palestine video which you should watch if you haven't I really think it's some of my best work if I do say so myself but it's become clear to me that Joe Biden seems poised to lose this election if it's between he and Donald Trump understand that I am not saying that because I want that to be so that's just what seems evident to me between the many people outright refusing to vote for him or who simply just don't feel compelled to get out and vote for him because whether you're a Democrat or not whether you believe that Joe Biden has done a good job as president or not I think we can all agree we should all be able to agree that Joe Biden and the Democrats have not done a good job on selling the public of that lots of presidents do bad things lots of presidents up lots of presidents just do nothing for the people but if the government and the media play their cards right and they package and sell them just right they can be beloved figures in spite of all that Pat Williams has a joke where he Compares choosing an American president to being in a toxic relationship and he wonders why we can't just date a president first and now now it's time for a new president and all they want us to do is pick a new president I feel like didn't we just get out of a up relationship maybe we don't need a president right now can we be single as a country for a while and maybe date a president see how that work out for a couple months this is but we do date presidents that's what the first term is that's their time to love bomb us early and get us trip trip trip off them so by the time they're doing all kind of and war crimes and gaslighting us to our face we wait too deep it's way too late and they're sailing into that second term think about it American presidents have required to love bomb the American public right out the gate that's what the first 100 days is that's why they're signing mad executive orders for all to see the moment they take office they love bombing us and Biden didn't play the game right and it's little it's little that might seem are insignificant to people that impacts how everyday people feel remember how before the election Joe Biden promised that if he was elected he'd give everybody $22,000 stimulus checks but once he was in office he only gave us $1,400 checks claiming that the $600 we'd received before he even took office applied compare and contrast that to Donald Trump who along with all the other Republicans completely oppose giving the stimulus checks all to together but once the Democrat majority passed it anyway he fought to make sure that his name would be on people's checks so people receiving the money would perceive it as Donald Trump gave them that money so one was nickel and Diamond us and the other wouldn't give a but the one who wouldn't give us knew how to make it look to the public like he gave them everything listen Donald Trump might be a son of a but he's a son of a who knows how to play the game I say all this to say Joe Biden has not managed to truly capitalize on the Nostalgia of the obom years and the long rope people were willing to him just because he wasn't Trump and endear himself to the American public don't nobody really with Biden for real let's look at this for what it is Biden's the person you date after a really toxic relationship a really  up relationship because you think they're so boring they're just so meh they seem safe so color you shock to learn that they ass too he was never America's First Choice nor the second I want to remind y'all that before 2020 Joe Biden had run for president pres in 1988 and 2008 and both times America said please please please curios Biden is the president for a specific cocktail of reasons it's not just that people wanted Donald Trump out of office because he's a bigot who stoked hate his entire time in office I don't like how much my side of the political aisle likes to downplay the significance of Trump's rhetoric by saying that Democrats and Republicans are the same just without the violent rhetoric and there is some truth the Democrats choosing more palatable and discreet and C rhetoric and dog whistles but we too easily dismiss the impact of a bold white supremacist inspiring and invoking that hate in millions of people and generations to come if you understand the importance of speech when you want your faves just to speak on an issue you shouldn't downplay the real and tangible impacts of a bigoted leader of one of the most powerful countries in the world but it was 2020 we were in a global pandemic and yes we are still in that pandemic but we were in the thick of covid hundreds of thousands of people were dying Millions Millions worldwide lockdowns across the country job losses businesses closing widespread fear and panic and this Donald Trump is telling people to drink bleach don't don't piss me off suddenly Donald Trump's presidency felt like the beginning of the world flipping upside down suddenly a political world that used to dog whistle and Gaslight quietly began barking and broadcasting hate everywhere and play sight the president was now a Twitter troll hate crimes up Nationwide and the next thing you know you're in a Global pandemic feeling like you woke up in an end of the world Bird Box ass movie and you have no idea what the to do so if you're feeling like that you will clamor for any sense of normaly returning to yester year the time before it and Biden might not know how to play the game but you better bet your bottom dollar Barack mother Obama does and that's why America loves Obama in spite of all the war crimes the average American neither knows nor gives a about and just by being associated with American love for the Obama years Biden was able to get in but most people never actually with Joe Biden himself most were apathetic and many downright couldn't stand his 1994 crime Bill doing ass he was always on thin ice he was never Obama you think we would let people talk about Sasha or Malia the way people bust Hunter Biden's back in people wouldn't even let you talk about bow and sunny like that meanwhile don't nobody know the Biden's pets names just for knowing it sake in fact I'm going to be real with y'all there was one of them award ceremonies earlier this year and they brought Joe Biden out but they announced her not by her name but as the first lady of the United States of America and I just knew Michelle was about to come out I say all this to say Biden was never truly popular now combined out with the fact that he's 81 going on 10 and now this in Palestine I just don't see it happening for him granted a lot can change between now and the presidential election Biden's popularity is low and continuing to sink at the moment he has about a 40% approval rating and no president has been reelected with those kinds of numbers but presidents who've been reelected have pulled at similar numbers this far out from the election people of short attention spans and a lot of people swearing up and down they won't vote for him or that it doesn't matter if Trump wins may not feel that way in a year but for now it's not looking good for Biden which is why i' said in my Palestine video that I understood people refusing to vote for Joe Biden unless he stops funding Israel's genocide of the Palestinian people or calls for a ceasefire or refusing to support the Democrats unless they provide a different nominee or call for a ceasefire and ask Joe Biden to step down or call for it I said I understood it and I explained why the strategy makes sense to me that's not me endorsing the strategy or telling people to do it I'm not the reasons that I understand is because I really really do not have the time to beat folk over the head into voting for Joe Biden if that's not what they're going to do and I'm not not going to give myself a headache getting mad or telling myself people are going to vote for him if they're not I only have the time and energy to contend with the actual reality and in real life wouldn't it be better for the Democrats to know now earlier than later that nigg is not trying to vote for Joe Biden isn't it better to let the Democrats know earlier that they're not feeling moved or encouraged to vote by the propaganda and actions they're currently taking and that they'll need them to switch it up if they plan to get their vote personally I much much rather get the memo earlier than later so I at least try to adjust accordingly especially when Joe Biden says he doesn't think he'd even be running if it wasn't for Trump because it's precisely a trump and Joe Biden matchup that the American public don't seem to give a  about right now politicians are supposed to give people they want in order to get their vote that's how a transactional relationship Works ceasefire vote ceasefire vote ceasefire vote you do the ceasefire you get the vote I get it I get it I get the logic besides we cannot tell folks that voting is a tool and then get mad M when they use it as such and leverage their votes some people are single-issue voters or they decide to operate strategically by presenting themselves as single-issue voters to force politicians to act you don't have to agree with the issue that people are choosing to die on the hill for to understand and respect the tactic is legitimate but just know that for a lot of people right now the genocide happening in Gaza has radicalized them into either single issue voters or presenting themselves as such for the moment in order to pressure Biden to stop aiding Israel mind you I want to be clear that I am not arguing that I believe that the majority of the Democrats voter base supports Palestine or have been radicalized by support for Palestine into not supporting Biden I don't think that at all America as a nation supports Israel and it always has Republicans and Democrat administrations across the board but that's not because those particular parties choose to back Israel it's because America must support imperialism there was no logical reason for any of us to assume Joe Biden in the United States Congress was going to respond to October 7th and any differently than it has what's new is they're losing the propaganda War it's important to remember that for as mad as we are on the left at Biden Congress is in damn near perfect harmony with all these pro-israel decisions including censuring the only Palestinian member of Congress Forida to leave with the assistance of 22 Democrats so I am not at all under the impression that the majority of Americans or even the majority of the Democrats voterbase are voting are not voting for Biden based on Palestine although I definitely think it's going to cause him the Muslim vote especially in swing States like Michigan but I think the largest issue will be voter apathy because they just haven't been giving anything to vote for coupled with this kind of I don't want to minimize the efforts of Americans who want America to be better or to be a reflection of them and their individual values or who are hanging their hats on Palestine I just want to add some context to everything because sometimes I feel like it's important that we zoom out and remember exactly what America is when we get to discussing American political parties and what we want and expect from American governments for example in the Bahamas where I'm from we have a parliamentary system but we have a two-party system just like y'all that we bounce between nonetheless your Democrats and Republicans are our F&M and PLP the F&M and the PLP are very different parties and I don't think Henny baman would seriously say that they're the same even if they have things in common and you may get some similar outcomes see similar kinds of corruption or feel similar feelings of dissatisfaction at the end of their administrations the PLP is more likely to be supported by working-class Bohemian people while the F&M is more likely to be supported by middle class and well-to-do bahamians as well as immigrants like my father who wouldn't feel welcomed by the plp's more consistent Embrace of xenophobia each party has fundamental differences but both are homophobic sexist misogynist patriarchal anti-abortion and fundamentally regressive as both must at the Baseline reflect what the nation is and the Bahamas is a constitutionally Christian Nation in fact I do believe we're the only one in the world which is a fact we boast it's a Christian Nation it's in our con stitution that bamian men can have children with non- bamian citizen women and pass citizenship down to their children but if I A bamian woman has children with a non- Bahamian man I can't pass citizenship to my kids and to understand how fundamentally ingrained and consistent with the beliefs of the bamian people these ass backwards misogynous ass views are while I was in college we actually had a referendum to change that in the Constitution and behman including women voted overwhelmingly to keep it the Bahamas doesn't consider rape and marriage rape we call it marital rape refus to Outlaw it and regularly debate and defend the merits of it in Parliament if young bohemian girls are raped and assaulted by grown ass men the country calls them Fast and Fresh and blames them the reason why our two major political parties are different but the same when it comes to certain fundamental ideals is because for a party to survive and thrive in this nation they must at minimum reflect the ideals the nation is made up on and the Bahamas is not made up on my personal Progressive ideals it was formed at top the regressive ideals of Christianity and all that comes along with it Americans sit in America saying that Democrats and Republicans are the same because they're committed to imperialism capitalism policing and white supremacy all the while never realizing that those things are America it's what the country is it's quite literally how the country exists that's the why the two major parties in this country's two- party system are all invested in those particular ideals because that's what America is imperialism refers to a policy or ideology of extending rule over people in other countries using diplomacy or military force for extending political economic access of power often using military force America maintains militarized US embassies in at least 192 countries across the world whether any of those countries truly want them there or not including my own country the Bahamas which has never been under us rule nor do we receive any special treatment or immigration benefits of any kind from America is it doesn't seem to even stop Ronda santis from threatening to level us at a million hypothetical scenarios nobody asked him for so why is it there why do we allow it why do we allow this base because we don't actually have a choice no one does not really not without the threat of violence which is why America has been at War 226 of its 244 years of existence Americans just don't realize that because they never get to feel or experience it because that's the privilege and benefit that comes along with being a citizen of the world power that's doing out these atrocities you don't know not unless and until a 9/11 happens at which point American propaganda still says everyone else a terrorists and brutes lashing out and that's all there is to it America does not just support genocide in Palestine America is in and of itself a genocidal Nation everything that you think makes America so damn great so damn powerful so damn worthy of Celebration every July 4th is made possible by not just historic commitments to imperialism capitalism and white supremacy but everyday active efforts the reasons Americans are able to sit in a country that abuses criminalizes kills incarcerates and deports the Very migrant it advertises itself to worldwide as a Melting Pot and whose migration it's made necessary by Decades of interference in their own countries and just say they'll up and move to and work in other countries like Canada and Europe for fun or because they're mad about who won an election because your American passport can do that that is a reflection of the imperialism that you think only two political parties believe in when really it's what's holding up this nation and the Privileges that Americans don't even stop to notice such much less give up since October 7th Israel has killed more than 14,000 Palestinian people Joe Biden and Congress obviously sent $14.5 billion to Israel to Aid their attacks on Gaza initially following the October 7th amas attacks Biden only asked Congress for an additional two billion dollar to Aid Israel's attacks on Gaza but by October 20th this Biden rolled his old ass on into Congress and act for 14 whole ass billion dollars and they gave him 14.5 but here is the thing the United States sends Israel $3.8 billion every year I hate to gag the Liberals and nostalgic Obama lovers but that annual $3.8 billion we give Israel every year your boy Obama established that in 2016 he came up with that agreement with Netanyahu mind you the United States has always funded Israel's militarized occupation but it's not just Palestine it's far from just Palestine quoting from an article by an author whose name I will not butcher so it will be on the screen quote in the spring of 1805 US Army Officer and diplomatic Cil William Eden in Alliance with Hamad caraman the deposed brother of Yousef caraman tritan or today's Libya marched an army to attack DNA they easily captured the tripolitanian city with the help of three us ships and the Pasha was forced to capitulate the incident which led to the end of the first barbery war and a Victorious United States has been viewed by many scholars as the first US attempt at a coup and a foreign government through military interventionism triggering the country's consequent pursuit of global domination since then the United States has launched more bloody overseas military intrusions often swooping in on a country and launching deadly attacks until the target is thrown into chaos and its government overthrown from the end of World War II to 2001 The United States is initiated 2011 armed conflicts in 153 locations accounting for more than 80% of the total Wars that's occurred across the world in that time since 2001 Washington and its allies have dropped an estimated average of 46 bombs on other countries daily those Wars mainly in the name of democracy freedom and human rights were instead a reckless interference in the domestic affairs of other countries leaving behind death and the destruction in the Middle East Latin America and Eastern Europe for example us-led NATO forces carried out continuous air strikes for 78 days against Yugoslavia the result more than 8,000 civilians dead or injured and nearly 1 million displaced the US launched war in Afghanistan killed around 50,000 Afghan and civilians from 2001 to Mid April 2020 and reduced some 11 million to refugees furthermore years of Bloodshed have left more than 200,000 Iraqi civilians dead and dragged Libya into greater turmoil the United States is quote the most warlike nation in the history of the world said former US President Jimmy Carter in 2019 adding that this country had only enjoyed 16 years of Peace in its 242e history the US history of looting is associated with numerous military interventions and the organizations of cous to eliminate those governments that did not easily acceed to their demands and that's not even to say anything of the Congo Honduras and all kind of other countries Biden's response is unfortunately a very American one and it's not just worth mentioning what Trump's also very American positions and responses have been and that's not me trying to scare you by going but Trump that's just what's necessary because he's Biden's real opponent like it or not that is what we get if Biden loses so if I want to contend with reality and not just ideology I'm required to discuss what actually happens if we make one choice versus the other you have chaos Bloodshed War Terror and death look what's happening today because the occupant of the White House is a laughing stock all over the world America's enemies cannot believe how lucky they got they got real lucky every monster villain dictator and terrorist and there plenty of them I know most of them I got to know a lot of them all over the planet they're having a field day because they know they will never have it better than they do with crooked Joe who in many cases receive money from those countries and unfortunately with the most corrupt and incompetent president in our history we're closer to World War III than anyone can understand there's never been a time where we've been closer we're inches away and we have a man that literally can't speak he can't get off a state the Hamas terrorist invasion of Israel territory Israeli territory and the murder of Israeli soldiers today and uh the brutal murder of citizens is an act of savagery that must and will be crushed has to be it has to be dealt with very powerfully this is a time where the United States needs leadership we don't have leadership so you have a war that's going on and you're probably going to have to let this play out you're probably going to have to let it play out because a lot of people are dying there is no hatred like the Palestinian hatred of Israel and Jewish people and probably the other way around also I don't know you know it's not as obvious but probably that's it too I didn't want to do a huge thing on Palestine here but it's just at the Forefront of too many people's minds in terms of this election for me to not discuss it in order to unpack vo blue no matter who or to even engage with the issue of whether voting or voting in this election matters I have to address this argument that Democrats and Republicans are the same otherwise everything I say about voting Republicans and the threat of fascism will be met with the voice in the back of your head going so so why does it matter when Democrats and Republicans are the same I'm going to speak more specifically and less anecdotally about the platforms beliefs and happenings around the presidential candidates themselves a little later on but I first wanted to provide my personal and professional experience and perspective on the topic because like I said this all comes down to who we are how it impacts us and what we know Democrats and Republicans are not the same for me they absolutely have similarities and are aligned on some significant but they are not the same or at least their differences are material but let's think for a second the leader of the Republican party our last president Donald J Trump was impeached not once but twice incited a Insurrection and is facing a Litany of criminal charges the man's got like 91 criminal charges like that's unprecedented and we're still letting this run and there are people like on the left who are just kind of like yeah well you know what have Democrats done that's always the question what have Democrats have you looked it up have you tried looking it I mean maybe it's not enough and certainly there are plenty of things that I would like to be done I would like more to be done but just because you want more to be done doesn't mean you abandon the whole project that doesn't make it what what do people plan to get done people talk about this revolution burning it all down what going to burn it down a phoenix is going to Rise From the Ashes people have been talking about burning  down since 2015 that's like8 years ago where is this revolution people keep talking about where is it the has a mug shot the has a mug shot there are some of you that don't want mother to work at Walmart if they have a mug shot it could be your president though but I hear this sentiment that they're the same expressed often often to me and it frustrates me deeply especially in regard to policing and immigration I have represented probably more than a thousand people facing criminal charges and been tasked with getting them out of jail and as any defense attorney will tell you it's so easy to put somebody in jail all police have to do is make an arrest but it's very difficult to get people out of jail even when all the parties agree to the release of somebody from jail there's so much red tape and hurdles to jump over to get people out and I represent individual people so each of those individuals Freedom I'd have to actively pursue it matters whether five or 15 of my clients are in jail because each of those people are real people I have to speak to whose families I have to speak to whose lives lives are really impacted whose communities are impacted they're not abstract they're not make believe they're not imaginary they're not gestations each of those lives matter and for the purposes of trying to save them get them their freedom it makes a big difference whether there are five or 15 people who it's going to be incredibly difficult to free I want to get as many people as I can out of jail and each of those people matter if I have 15 people in jail if I have 15 clients in jail and I get 14 out of jail I don't say oh I'm done vast majority you know what I mean that one person in jail is one person I have to figure out how to free I have work to do each of those people matter I once represented a man who was facing significant time in prison because he stood accused of stealing an iPhone while armed with a gun no one was physically harmed in the crime but he still only had two choices pleaded the charge and accept years in prison or go to trial where I was certain because the judge had intimated as much that if convicted he would would be sentenced to significantly more time I remember listening to the more senior attorney explained to the man who was understandably angered by both choices because he wanted a third option one that didn't exist where he would be freed where he wouldn't be impr prison for years of his life in exchange for the loss of an iPhone and that was the moment for me that I truly understood what it means to be between a rock and a hard place a rock is hard and so is a hard place it's all bad it's all bad that's when I realized that my clients poor black and brown people will always be between a rock and a hard place in the courtroom because so much of what we're battling in the courtroom is already predetermined by the laws practices and policies the public is already chosen in its legislators judges and prosecutors to enforce to overp police my clients and land them in the courtroom in the first place I realized that me and my clients would always find ourselves between a rock and a hard place unless I started trying to politically educate the public so the public could change their mind minds and stop supporting and calling for the things that fuel and legitimize mass incarceration and I practice and work in New York City a place where Democrats are in power in just about every office or meaningful way so what happens often is I try to educate the public as to why the five people shouldn't be in jail or how the Democrat administrations were fighting want the five in jail instead of actually engaging with what I'm saying or what we need to do there are people who jump up and go see Democrats are the same because we have to fight them too because they policing too and that is infuriating to me as someone who actually has to get people out of jail who believes that each person's life matters and freedom matters and that for someone who actually wants to free people who sees individual lives and and not just the abstract numbers there is a meaningful difference between an Administration that wants to put five people in prison versus one who wants to put 15 in prison and when you tell me there's not I can't help but wonder whether you've taken the time to dislodge your head out your own ass oh why you cannot critique Democrats in a Biden Administration for any and every way that they continue to support the status quo without suggesting that there's no meaningful difference between what they and the Republicans want to do and do I believe that the people who say this believe that their virtue signaling to the rest of us that they're the real progressives that they really care about people but all it tells me is that you aren't actually involved in any fight on the ground in no tangible or material way if you aren't aware of the magnitude of difficulty and difference there is in fighting a democratic Administration versus a republican one if the lives of the 10 more people we could free fighting the Democrats instead of the Republicans do not matter to you we cannot even fight the misinformation the white supremacy and the bigotry being circulated like wildfire on Twitter because one right-wing jackass took it over and you think you're going to fight Donald Trump or Rona santis like you think that's the same as fighting Joe Biden but on the federal level we're speaking of people like Ronda santz who is yeah clear the kind of violence he wants to utilize right in order to wage his war on wokeness um and so that brings him to the third issue it's not just climate change it's just not just Justice um but it's it's it's also creeping fascism let me rephrase it it's not even creeping it's glaring blaring Theocratic fascism they do intend o overthrowing this democracy if necessary um and when I see the two parties I see a status quo party that is Happ with the way things are and you and I both know and everyone who's watching knows things the way they are suck right that's the Democratic party they oh it's okay the Republican party is actively trying to do everything they can to make this life unlivable yesy is the point with them and Ben's not being hyperbolic Ronda Sis's literal platform for president on his website literally says he's going to replace the woke mind virus the woke mind virus and I know for a fact that the cruel is the point with people like Dan santis and that I have the right read on him because I called Ron DeSantis every kind of evil Insidious monster and he put it in a compilation in his campaign ad for president I'm dead the ass was the original Terminator DeSantis is like the T1000 Ron santis is far more dangerous than Donald Trump they're just like oh well at least the santis isn't crazy like Trump and I'm like no you should be more scared of him than Trump he's like the worst version of trump Rhonda Sanders is Despicable uh he disgraceful the real reason this man is so terrifying is because he's managed to succeed in areas where Trump has failed I honestly believe the S was gorged in Hell there's no doubt in my mind look at my face we think DeSantis is more dangerous than Trump to some degree because he's less incompetent if anyone out there thinks somehow he is any better than Donald Trump and they don't know Ronda Santa that's who you think you can negotiate with someone marketing themselves based on your fear of the evil things they plan to do he didn't disagree with what I said he didn't add any context to it the defend himself no because he's someone who sees a black woman calling him evil as an endorsement because that is precisely the kind of thing his white supremacist voter based value that's today's Republican party I did an entire documentary on all the ways New York City's Democrat mayor Eric Adams is a tyrant who wants nothing more but to embolden a police state at the expense of black people brown people migrants and impoverished people and I did not make that documentary for you to come to the illogical conclusion that Republicans are the same because they are both cops as though the Republican and Administration we would have had under Adam's opponent Curtis SWA or even Governor Cathy hok's opponent wouldn't have been unimpeachable in their fascism and bigotry yes the Democrats like DeBlasio Cuomo hok Eric Adams all try to enact roll backs to Bill reform and the also Democratic council with people like Tiffany kaban Julia Salazar fight to save it and veto the regressive things Adams tries to do like expanding solitary confinement yes I have to fight Democratic administrations to save bail reform but it's also only the presence of a democratic Administration that made it possible for us to get bail reform that would be nonnegotiable if we had to get Republicans to do it in the first place so yeah New York City has has is definitely not a shining example of this a city on the hill for others to emulate I mean um you know we did not have a good candidate for mayor to vote for there was no one on the ballot who who had I think particularly Progressive ideas and so there was very little to distinguish the candidates in my mind you know we got a terrible mayor as a result that we got a a cop for a mayor but if you look where there were real races where there were real candidates to vote for real Progressive candidates leftists DSA members people with a long history of racial and economic Justice or those people won city council races there are a lot of very Progressive people on the city council not Progressive in the kente cloth Nancy Pelosi sense right but but actually people who Embrace abolition who see that there are fundamental problems with austerity politics and the neoliberal model of of economic development for cities there is resistance in the city council there are people putting forward new ideas and I think over time we're going to see the politics of the city reflect more closely the politics of the population because when we talk to New Yorkers through polling and other mechanisms we find out that they would like to see something other than policing to create safety in their communities they would like their Neighborhood Community Center opened up and fully staffed they would like to see Mental Health Resources they would like to see substance abuse resources and you know mayor Adams is not providing that but if you think that I find Eric Adams neophobic desire to keep migrants out of New York City or to be excused from providing them shelter evil what do you think I would feel if Curtis SEL was an office advocating we put the migrants and Rikers which is what he's doing we need to be so for real we will restore Law and Order to our communities and I will direct a completely overhaul doj to investigate every radical out of control fake crooked prosecutor in America for their legal racist in Reverse enforcement of the law I am also going to indemnify all police offices this is a big thing and it's a brand new thing and I think it's so important I'm going to indemnify through the federal government all police officers and law enforcement officials throughout the United States from being destroyed by the radical left for taking strong actions against Crime when I tell you how awful the Democrats are that should alarm you as to just how awful the Republicans are not serve as license for you to downplay the threat that is Republicans are the Democrats fighting tooth and nail to oppose change and maintain the status quo oh baby you bet your bottom dollar they are but the Republicans not going to fight us at all they're not going to fight us on it they going to shoot you on site baby and you know that you saw January 6th these are the people who take up arms to storm the capital who don't believe in the peaceful transference of power who set up death traps on migrant in the water who have Nazis marching proudly y'all forget died at the Insurrection yall remember that happened okay y remember they was planning to kill people okay okay okay I made that Eric Adams documentary for the same reasons that I recognized that political education was necessary if I wanted to improve the battles my clients were facing in the courtrooms because the reality is that the majority of the country does not see things the way I do I am outnumbered in the courtroom just as I am outnumbered in real life more people have been indoctrinated to believe in the vision Eric Adams presents them than than the vision I have because they haven't had much exposure to my vision I need to shift social Consciousness past Eric Adams to get it to where mine is or where it needs to be to help my clients but I'm if every time that I tried to expose what's wrong with the Eric Adams Visions to the people that I can at least reach and potentially shift a group of  say ah there's no difference between Eric Adams vision and Curtis Lea's Vision because you know what happens then we either stay stuck in place at Eric Adams Vision or Worse We Roll even further down the hill into fascism progress is a literal uphill battle so let's Envision it as such shall we if you visualize a hill put Liberation at the tippy top to get there we the people have to push an enormous boulder up that hill if Liberation is at the top fascism is at the bottom and that's where the Republicans are above them on that Hill is the status quo that's where the Democrats are we want to get past that point if we're standing there there on the hill essentially holding the fort on that Boulder trying to figure out how to push past that point in the hill and you say there's no difference between that point and the bottom of the hill where fascism is we might stay put holding the boulder off but what's more likely is some people stop helping us try to push the boulder upward or hold it off they simply let go and we roll down the hill into fascism I have been frustrated with this argument both professionally and personally for a while for a while especially when I see it in relation to policing and immigration in 2016 I was in law school in New York City in Queens but I was visiting my beloved Alma marer Ohio University in aens Ohio to speak to students for pre-law day and I remember being in the McDonald's drive through with two of my friends who then told me they were not going to vote for Hillary Clinton and I remember like it was yesterday one of my friends was from Brooklyn but she had chosen to register in Ohio swing state I was outnumbered to to one and at the time I really could not fathom that Hillary could lose to a bumbling orange buffoon anyway especially if I was to believe and I did believe that Hillary and the clintons were as Sinister and Powerful as i' had been told so I didn't bother to argue with her as she insisted on voting for Jill Stein in Ohio not New York City because as she and my other friend were the first to ever put it to me Democrats and Republicans were the same it made no difference whether Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump won in the days following Donald Trump's election I was Stu I came to the United States in 2008 specifically because I wanted to go to law school and become a lawyer in America and when I looked into the US's impossible immigration system one that I am still navigating 15 years later I knew it would be easier if I at least entered the American School System earlier so I convinced my parents to let me leave home just shy of my 15th birthday I will never be able to find the word to describe the amount of stress I have been under since the moment I made that decision the magnitude of impossibility it is navigating the US immigration system but imagine as was the case then that you've put in 10 years of pain to this long-term Vision you're about to approach the hardest part of that Journey finishing school and trying to find the needle in a hay stack that is a work visa or any path to permanent residency citizenship anything in this country if you're someone who came on a student visa and Donald Trump gets elected a man who made his platform explicitly on the promise that it was immigrants to hell and back and you're a black immigrant at that the most impacted and under discussed targets of the US immigration system I was devastated I remember being parked in my Volkswagen Beetle that I could not afford to keep weeping like weeping I mean Boo and whooing and then my friend called the one from Brooklyn who had voted for Jill Stein in Ohio because it made no difference whether Hillary or Trump won and to my surprise that friend was boo who and too talking about she's devastated and I should go to DC with her to put on pink hats in March and I said ain't that about a ain't that about a I know why I'm booing but why is she no seriously why is she if you believed if you believe that there is no difference truly what would you have to be crying about what do you have to March about about what do you have to protest about and there were a lot of people who said like that and cried and marched in hats and there are a lot of people who continue to say things like that while devoting their every waking second to following electoral politics and the happenings of these elections if they were the same it truly wouldn't matter what happens in these elections and it wouldn't matter to you the person saying that what happened in these elections you wouldn't care you wouldn't put your energy into arguing any any positions into giving a flying and that is not a knock to people who vote third party or people who voted for Jill Stein that's specifically a knock the people who lie through their teeth and say Democrats and Republicans are the same or that it makes no difference which is in office when they know that's a lie from hell that they do not believe in that's why they're crying that's why they're marching in pink  hats the people who truly do believe they're the same who truly think it doesn't matter truly don't give a and they're not following this stuff they're not commenting on this stuff at all they're not going out to vote so let's just stop being disingenuous shall we it's the lying I can't get behind it's the lying and the posturing as though people who vote for Democrats or believe in harm reduction or voting for the lesser of two evils are nonsensical enemies of progress how any individual feels about a political party or an Administration is based on how they experience them so I'm not going to say that there aren't any people out there whose material needs and circumstances are unaffected or at least as far as they know based on whether Republicans Or democrats are in office but they're not me they're not the people feeding you this messaging on the internet and in the media and they're not the most marginalized people among us there are objective material differen between the Democrats and the Republicans across the board but I'm going to get into the substance of that later on when we discuss Republicans and the threat of fascism while also seriously discussing the ways Democrats are in fact still our opposition seeking to maintain the status quo for now I just want to explain the material differences between a Republican and Democrat Administration for me subjectively and for the people I advocate on behalf of and why I eliam me could and would never tell you they're the same even if I wanted to win whatever lus test y'all got going on there's a personal cost to me as an immigrant and a professional cost to me as a lawyer and an advocate under a republican Administration there just is I wept When Donald Trump was elected and not a single tear was shed in vain I came to America as an international student on a series of F1 student visas student visas do not come with absolutely any path to citizenship or permanent residency or a green card or a work visa NADA none of that so to the Americans inevitably asking why don't I apply for citizenship it's because I can't I am literally unable I am not eligible no immigrant can just decide we want citizenship and apply in C test otherwise we would it don't work like that that's American propaganda fed to you through the media so that you wonder why we don't just do it the right way meanwhile 85% of all undocumented immigrants in America were documented immigrants who became Visa overstates because they had no path to legally remain in fact we not only don't have a path to citizenship as an international student we're technically not even supposed to demonstrate intent to remain in other words don't look too comfortable put your bags down be ready to scadaddle as an international student on an F1 Visa all you're entitled to is one year of opt following graduation which means one year that you're allowed to work a job without a work visa before you have to get the of the country so when I graduated law school I had one year to work my job as a public defender before I needed to leave if I couldn't get a work visa or another means to stay here I applied for an eb2 Visa with a non-interest waiver that caused me thousands of dollars to self petition for when my opt ended I couldn't keep working but I also couldn't leave the country or my application would be considered abandoned that's how to get you so I had to go on an unpaid leave and figure out how to afford to live in New York City I planned for this though usually this unpaid leave period while you wait to get the temporary work permit Insurance supposed to get while your visa application pens last about 2 to 3 months so I work like a dog to save enough money to pay a few months rent in advance of the unpaid leave what would have been 2 to 3 months under a Democrat Administration turned into 7 months under Trump and $32,000 worth of lost income for me before my Visa was ultimately denied because while they recognized me as an outstanding alien with an advanced degree as they told me my proposed Endeavor as a public defender only benefited the Indigent people of New York City and was thus not of substantial interest to the nation while this is happening several of my friends who' schooled in America would also suffer from some heartbreaking denials for having to move back home I eventually got sponsored a work visa and now under Biden's Administration have received much swifter approvals and I'm on a better track I've been in America 15 years and I can confidently tell you that no party or Administration has lifted a finger to make the conditions and shitty system I've been battling better but I am telling you that Republicans made it significantly worse and I felt that impact personally especially as someone who was an outspoken advocate against the US criminal system it didn't go unnoticed to me when Trump's Administration suddenly required all immigrants to disclose links to all of our social media accounts you know um back in 2020 I had one of my viewers reach out and say Mike this is basically life or death for me like if Biden gets back in then he could reinstate DACA and that literally means that I get to stay in this country like that's that's that's somebody's entire life like that is not an insignificant thing okay so I started as an immigration just to like add context the St I'm going to be coming from I started as an immigration attorney in 2017 so right when the Trump Administration was like really getting going and you know practicing doing what I do which is removal defense and AK defending people from deportation in court um it was pretty miserable I mean like on a on a daily practical public defender type of level it was like you couldn't negotiate at all about anyone's Humanity you couldn't try to make any sort of like know the criminal legal system as you obviously know you can like negotiate with the prosecutors and try to get you know a favorable outcome for the people that you're representing where was like during the Trump Administration there was like none of that at all it wasn't even a conversation you couldn't even like go to try to even you know try to persuade someone it just wasn't even on the table from what I understand I think in Texas uh border patrol or something they shot somebody across the border recently different local Governors have been shipping migrants from the US Mexico border where literally start purposely creating fake schools trying to catch uh people that came over with with with the education visas or what you feel me like that status through education you purposely created a fake school and you lured them to the school they tried to go to the school to keep their visa and you have deported them we seen that happen in t we seen it happen since like N I ain't got time like 2016 we seen I seen so much crazy happen there was like no I think I underestimated this all hey son yeah apparently Spider-Man about to come in here you feel me Spiderman I heard Miles Morales is facing deportation too and this does not mean that Democrats aren't awful in Immigration they are or that different kinds of immigrants don't have just as hard a time under a Democrat Administration or that you should applaud the Democrats and immigration the first group of people that both parties are willing to sacrifice on the altar of the news cycle and I'm not even talking about just L but in the altar of the news cycle immigrants particularly black immigrants we saw what they did to the Haitians that came to the Border in Texas and they got they deported those Haitians at the Border in Texas over the one the same one where they had the guy on the whip with black man y fun fact immigration is a black issue 7% of non-citizens in the US are black but 20% of those facing deportation on criminal grounds are black 44% of people detained by ice from 2020 to now are Haitian bonds for Haitian detaining average $6,700 54% higher than other immigrants black immigrants face higher Asylum denial rates as well among the 10 nationalities with the most Asylum decisions from 2012 to 2017 Haitians had the second highest denial rate at 87% in the years before that period Jamaicans had the highest Asylum denial rate Somalians also had one of the highest Asylum denial rates in that same time period in 2017 Somalians also experienced the highest rate of deportations according to the American Bar Association so when Biden became president you know that was at least for me as a public defender and I'll stop centering myself in a second but I think it's important to know that like yeah I could start filing like packets for what are called prosecutorial discretion requests to actually try to get people out of ice detention and to try to negotiate you know favorable outcomes for people who shouldn't be going through the deportation process at all I unfortunately uh I don't know if unfortunately but for them unfortunately I believe that no one should be deported and I represent a number of people who have criminal convictions and criminal arrest histories and you know on a practical material Level for the folks that I represent Within These different types of proceedings that whole prosecutorial discretion does not exist for them at all at least in like especially as the years have gone on because they did change you know their internal policies within DHS the department of pment security which is like the major federal agency that um houses ice you know they did change their internal policies to allow for people to file those requests but in terms of actually following their own guidance they don't at all they and the B Administration would argue well you know this was taken a court federal district courts didn't rule in our favor like we did what we could do but what I've noticed about the B Administration is that they kind of do that on like every issue they throw up their hands like we did the least that we can do and you know that should be good enough for you and it is what it is I also think that I feel like a lot of people know about this that they've been shipping migrants from the US Mexico border to cities throughout the United States not that random there's certain you know they obviously Target what they would say is like Progressive liberal cities and New York City has been one of them and the bid Administration has done next to nothing to actually support the people that are coming here and you know I I understand that like a lot of people have feelings about the way that New York local elected officials talk about the need for what's called work authorization okay getting your work permit people are delayed for 6 months after filing their Asylum application from even getting a work permit you know that can be a really long time especially if you don't have access to anyone to support you to even file the the Asylum application in the first place and then you have to wait another six months and a lot of people are saying like these local elected officials are just trying to get people back to work for the economy and don't value their lives because people need to have shelter and they absolutely do need to have shelter and local officials are totally failing at providing shelter for anyone but at the same time there's something that the bid Administration could do which is you know expedite people's ability to get work authorization the executive branch has a lot of power to make that happen and they've done next to nothing because I from my perspective they just want to continue to keep migrants within a subass of workers where they can never access anything and are just constantly working in this vulnerable state Without Shelter and without any means to actually you know get a job the dams don't do enough I agree I agree but hear me and hear me good Republicans are fascists now for a word from my past self because I've done the Biden versus Trump versus the Santa substantive comparison before and why reinvent the wheel take it away old me pretty widely known at this point that Joe Biden was responsible for the 1994 crime bill for those who aren't familiar with the law it's responsible for bringing us to likes of things like three strikes law mandatory life sentences for repeat offenders and funding more policing in prisons and before topping the mass incarceration charts with the 1994 crime Bill Joe Biden's first Smash Hit was the anti-drug Abuse Act of 19 1986 that act set mandatory minimums for crack cocaine offenses with much harsher sentences compared with Powter cocaine that's suspicious that's weird mind you he had none of this smoke for his son and his drug use or any of the ly of issues Hunter Biden has and it's not that I want him to treat his son's addiction with criminalization it's that he wouldn't dream of doing such a thing but he couldn't dream of handling it any other way if the person struggling with addiction looks like me but none of that is my gripe within present day it doesn't matter to me what's in Joe Biden's heart nor am I dogmatically angry with him for the past if in the present Biden were trying to move away from over policing mass incarceration I'd be happy to take that unfortunately that's just not the tea Biden is very much so the police loving mass incarceration respectability politics pushing man he's always been and that's why it's time to pull his file before being elected Joe Biden promised me I mean us that if he was elected he'd give us all $22,000 stimulus checks but when he won broke boy Biden tells us it's $2,000 subtract what he already gave us but then in May of 2020 Biden a man who was just counting pennies with our stimulus money raised state and local governments for committing to use at least $10 billion in federal stimulus money to bolster police departments he encouraged them to spend even more police and to do it quickly to beat the summer crime Spike he expressly committed to funding a whopping 100,000 additional police officers mind you the police killed at least 1,195 people in 2022 that we know of and they've already killed 320 people this year and black people were 26% of people killed by police in 2022 despite being only 133% of the population in May 2022 Biden signed an executive order he called the most significant police reform in decades that included a national law enforcement accountability database that would give us detailed information about police officers who commit misconduct that database was supposed to launch on January 20th of this year and it's May where the database at and he admonished protesters on every chance he could get this violence of looting and burning and destruction of property rioting is not protesting looting is not protesting setting fires is not protesting but with all of Biden's flaws I want to be clear for everything bad about Joe Biden there are 10 worst things about Dan santis and Trump who are devil and Demon evil ghoul like creatures who mean us Tom the only question we really need to ask ourselves is which is the devil and which is just a demon to answer that it's time to play a little game called how evil are we we're going to go bar for bar on the evil starting off strong Trump gave us Smash Hits like January 6th a whole goddamn Insurrection where these really try to take the capital yeah that happened in 2021 DeSantis championed the anti-riot law which among other things grants civil immunity the people who decide to drive their cars into protesters who are blocking a road US District Judge Mark Walker ruled the law unconstitutional because it was so vague and over Brad it amounted to an assault on the First Amendment rights of free speech and assembly as well as the Constitutions do process protections because quote people engaged in peaceful protests are innocently the same area when a demonstration turned violent could face felonies and stiff penalties the law would have made it a felony to block traffic during a protest and added additional felonies for property damage speaking of unconstitutional Trump gave us not one not two but three Boos on the Supreme Court and that's why it's the kangaroo court now but that's not all folks Trump hated police brutality protest more than DeSantis ever could dream of doing it rapid fire bonus points Trump sent the National Guard and federal police to Kenosha to brutalize protesters then he gave Kenosha police $1 million and another $41 million to support all the police in Wisconsin for a job well done brutalizing the protesters then he sent federal police to the cour houses in Portland to beat up those protesters then he signed an executive order giving people 10year sentences for destroying any federal property on monuments the santis passed the don't say gay bill which prohibited discussion of sexual orientation or gender identity in schools but Trump launched a thing called operation legend that led to 5,500 more arrests but desus not only passed a host of laws restricting voting and Jerry mandering the out of Florida to suppress people's right to vote he also had 19 people mostly black arrested for a political stunt Vanity Fair said quote what happened was that the santis essentially exploited Mass confusion around the Florida amendment that allowed some ex-felons to vote body camera footage obtained in October by the Tampa Bay Times showed an officer expressing surprise about the charges against the man he was tasked with handcuffing and telling someone on the phone I've never seen these charges before in my life Trump gave hundreds of millions of dollars worth of surplus military equipment to local police but DeSantis passed the stop woke act which B conversations about race in schools and businesses and allows students and workers white students and workers to sue if they believe a classroom lesson or workplace training course caused them to feel guilt anguish or any other form of psychological distress due to their wace but Trump signed an executive order to help prevent violence against the police but to STIs eliminated Medicaid coverage for transgender care for people of any age and also bar transgender girls from competing in sports and before The Supreme Court even overturned roow DeSantis signed a law law Banning abortions beginning at 15 weeks of pregnancy with no exceptions for rape or incest but Trump gave the doj nearly 400 million for new police training what do I mean when I say fascist I mean authoritarian A regime devoid of civil liberties night night to democracy and this point truly should not have to be argued ultimately like when it comes to what is the actual like very clear difference I think between uh whoever is in power is I mean one thing is is in terms of just the transfer of power like if one party you're questioning are they even going to have another election I mean at that point why are we even having a discussion like you want to make sure that part is not going to be in power if one part is just anti-democracy but also just that the clear difference I I see between the two is just is socially culturally is is you know is the treatment of of marginalized communities like that is I think the the clearest difference that we have seen uh comparing you know Trump in power to to Democrats in power and seeing the transition in terms of how culture shifted after Trump won like witnessing that firsthand and openly discussing oh yeah there's you know there's some Nazis out there in front of Disneyland like like what like eight years ago discussing about na like Nazis holding the Nazi flag out in front of Disneyland would be insane but no that's that's a thing that's happened and it's a normal thing now and that was not normal before Trump came in so understanding like it can it can often times be hard to really see how much things have changed because it has happened you know somewhat gradually but we have I think many of us have sort of just gotten used to how extreme things have gotten we really have to go back and think just how much it has changed like go back eight years think of how much it really has changed just in in discussions culturally uh you know media things have gotten way more extreme on the right the threat of fascism is real but but it's not just abstract and intellectual and academic and ideological it's two at least two people Trump and DeSantis there's more of it those just two that have a chance to win yeah who are legitimately fascist like real life fascist who could win if we don't organize against them so what I will say is at this moment um I will do everything I can both as a private voter and as a public voice to ensure that Ronda santis and Donald Trump are not in the white house that's my number one priority how that looks what the H that plays out I don't know yeah you know I suspect it means I'll have to hold my nose and vote for Biden again but if there's another way to do it I'll do it but the number one priority maybe even the only priority for me right now and I I can't say this enough is to keep them out of we're dealing with a group of Republicans that are Fascist and so this is the thing that drives me Furious about our entire political system is that people are satisfied between bad and horrible they're satisfied for our choices to be between bad and horrible would I say a de the Democratic party is bad when you look since 1980 absolutely no question would I ever let them lose to a republican if I could help it no because Republicans are fascists and they are running headlong into fascism they're also just extremely dumb I voted for Biden I'm going to vote for Biden again I will get out there and knock doors if I have to most certainly will um but I have a very low standard of expectations from Joe Biden My requirement for him over the last four years was to stop the pandemic lost that fight and not be a fascist yeah so I'm one for two okay all right um I'm going to vote for him again with that bar being that low I would rather vote in the future for someone who can win who actually is going to to do the laundry list of things that we need done in this country however we don't have that choice right now we have a choice between the status quo which is pretty horrible for Humanity and sociopaths okay my eye is on the ball I'm going to vote for the status quo I'm going to do everything I can to make sure he gets into office but I'm looking straight past him because I know he's not going to do the things that need to be done yeah so fascism isn't just you know something that we think is bad F we we're not using fascism in the way that Republican use communism and call Joe Biden a communist with fascism there is a certain set of criteria right it's not just the policies but there's a lot of other components it's it's the ultra nationalism it is the contradictory statements about political opposition they're really weak but at the same time they're really really scary and they pose an existential threat to us it's the demonization of minorities the violation of political Norms uh the dismissal of uh laws and the Constitution there there's so much that the way that propaganda even functions like the way that they demonize trans people is very similar to the way that they demonize Jewish people back in um you know uh World War II era Germany so fascism is very different and if you ask a political scientist um whether or not the modern Republican party is fascist I think that nine out of 10 of them would say yes and that is very difficult for political scientists to agree upon because they don't even agree on a definition of democracy yet but if you ask them does this look like fascism in your assessment I think most of them can see yes this is fascism and because it's not just like far right or conservative politics like it's different it poses a unique threat we're not talking about paleocons or neocons or Libertarians or neoliberals we're talking about a group of people who are organized in opposition to democracy and human rights and it's just about power and the accumulation of power and that's literally it they will do whatever they need to do to assume as much power as possible even if that means crushing democracy I I think that a trump Administration or really any Republican Administration I feel like you shouldn't have to say it but you kind of still do like that would be very very bad and even if everything isn't going to be peachy keen with the Democrat in control it is exponentially worse with Republicans especially now because the Republicans of today are not the same as the Republicans from yesterday right like I remember having conversations with my co-workers in 2008 about how scar would be if somebody like Sarah Palin got in the white house right when I was voting for Obama that was the first time that I voted and nowadays it's like oh my God Sarah Palin is probably just an average Republican so I mean the Overton window has shifted to the right things are much different now than they were just 10 years ago and this moment is really unique in the sense that you know we always hear hey this is the most important election ever uh but I feel like each election is getting more important because the stakes are higher and this is a matter of uh life and death I think for the country and I don't feel like that's hyperbole because I mean when you see how the entire Republican party has bought into this delusion that Trump won the election in 2020 and now he stating explicitly that he's going to arrest political opponents because he has no choice he said that on Glen Beck's program when he talks about basically violating the Constitution to end Birthright citizenship and a lot of other really horrifying things about immigration uh I just feel like this is one of those moments where 20 years from now I'm going to look back and ask how did I respond to that did I meet the moment and there's not much that I can do as just a regular citizen um but I do have a platform so the way that I respond to this is listen our number one goal I think is to defeat fascism everything comes second because if we don't defeat fascism if America becomes an authoritarian regime then we don't even have the chance to get anything done education is elevation the classroom getting attacked they hey all all all the say you never know where you're going unless you know where you been education is the great equalizer well if you don't read the books of this listen hey whether we talking about gay G gay issues black issues class issues or trans issues the classroom is really where it's being folded at um uh uh was it revolutionary suicide Hue P Newton book that's the book that really lit a fire under of my ass and change how I seen everything when I realized impact they had on children is what made J egga Hoover see them as the biggest threat to domestic security it was about education how they were educating black children on teaching them their rights giving them free breakfast to me it's really about like what's going on in their classroom you feel me like when we think about how individuals don't have the the the skills or have the tenacity to do x y and Z's because they got failed in the classroom you know what I mean I think that is it's I feel like the classroom got to do with everything to me to my mind like how we teach people how to understand themselves how to understand the world it really come from that so we see that the military and all these different people get on all these different increases in their budget and you was crying about defunding the police but they defunding education and you trying to talk about I think the education really come here you talk about defunding everything hey education been been been on the constant defund for the past 30 years listen man this in Kansas in Kansas and in Missouri a 17y old girl two 17 year old girls girls got taken to jail for them communicating on social media about getting abortions they a't even to get their abortions see what I'm saying for me it's like literally through social media go subpoena your Google you feel me and if you was even contemplating thinking about aborting a child they can literally take you to jail and criminalize you I'm almost to the point where technically you see what I'm saying if you in a state like Florida and you decide that you want to do some drag or you know what it be real with you you ain't even got to want to do drag or decided you was going to do drag somebody else can just seen and see what you do start the way that you performed your gender in that instance was not was too much on a public platform you can be streaming you can be streaming doing some you know what I'm saying we got one we got them got him going to be real you going to jail like there there are particular ways that the medium of social media can be used as a vehicle to criminalize your ass and or literally be the thing it's criminalizing in itself it's just like all this all this A Ain going to go around nowhere when they marching down people to go talk to Congress about sharing data and all of those they can literally say hey man and even now thinking about it all the campuses in Texas no diversity and inclusion I seen that University of Houston and I think right they took away the university for sure they took away the LGBT community office and I know it's extremely frustrating with the Democrats and them not doing what we exactly want them to do all the time I mean I mean I complain yell scream on the internet all the time about it but like I look at at it as like there are particular things that I'm really concerned about and a lot of these things are wrapped up in policy so I work in the environmental sphere you know um and I do Environmental Compliance I write documents all the time so it's very important for me to see like legislation and policy that is going to help people the most and the Republicans are straight up de when it comes to that and I know we joke around about this all the time about them being demons and stuff like that but I mean they literally want to delete environmental laws and I'm not even joking I'm dead dead serious they want to delete it like I remember back in like maybe stud As Trump stepped in office I think one of the first things he did like you know what that word climate change we're deleting that that being said while Democrats may not be fascist they are violently committed to the status quo they do not adequately fight fascism there are many ways that they differ from Republicans more in rhetoric than application and there are many significant ways they are failing us on issues that matter most of Voters like the climate crisis drug policy crime and policing immigration the attack on the trans Community just to name a few I mean a few just a few for me I guess I view the Democratic party as like just as complicit or rather complicit and not actively pursuing it but they also are you know like I look at like you know Hakeem Jeff and like his like outspoken support for like Zionism like const I I really view like the Democratic party as just as involved anybody who does not believe that people have choice and and for the people going to say oh Senator Turner you know uh Trump is a is a is a president he's a threat the Republicans are a threat you know what they are the santis is a threat ramash shami is a threat Nicki Haley is a threat all these all of these people I almost called them something yeah they threats so the Democratic party need to comport themselves accordingly like they a threat and pass policies that that animate the real lived experience of people so then we don't have to worry so much about the threat why they putting the onus Olay on the voter to worry about the threat instead of comporting themselves through public policy in a way that they understand that Neo fascism is a threat that's all I'm saying oh I definitely agree that that's like where the right is moving and has been moving and that it's been going on for years and it's getting worse like all the time and for me though too I view like people because a lot of this has been like happening even just in the past couple of years under the Biden Administration and it's like what have you been doing you know like why haven't you been using your Myriad of exe different forms of executive power that you could use to respond to any of this why are you not even being outspoken about any of this why is there no direct confrontation against right-wing fascists the material conditions on the ground often look very similar I will say the rhetoric shifts right so we are in a space where under Trump Administration it was way more antagonistic often times under Republican administrations we're fighting way more for basic agreements uh I think one of the words that has become really politicized and is a red meat word for folks on the right is the concept of harm reduction as a philosophy um and that is something that we don't have to fight as much tooth and nail on rhetoric on the rhetoric side on on the left however that's where it ends right the way that I sort of look at both parties really in everything but specifically with trans issues is that I don't really see anything that the Democrats are doing that are is demonstrably helping trans people like there are some protections that they're trying to put into place and I do like a lot of the sort of uh discussion of like trans issues that you know Biden and a few other Democrats have been discussing but I also very much see this centus position that constantly comes up more and more of like let's stop talking about trans issues because it's a right-wing talking point that gets a lot of like attention and so they're willing often to like throw trans people into the bus or ignore trans people instead of actually standing up for Trans people um because it is for what for what they see as a quote unquote losing issue we'll be in a situation where for example the Obama Administration where they lifted the syringe ban um which was really important it it came back right and it did come back because of Republicans coming back into power but the truth is is like the Dems don't really stand firm on the things that we need them to stand firm for for the for the ground to be transformed and also part of the thing that's um that's difficult about the Democratic party is that this they'll take syringe exchange for example overwhelmingly supported by research as an effective Public Health intervention they understand it but they're not showing up for a rally for it right they're not um they're not going to be fighting with us against the conservatives unless it is politically viable for them so we're constantly in a space where while they might intellectually or theoretically see it as something that could be helpful we're constantly in a space where Democrats position drug policy as a vulnerability for Democrats and so while conservatives are more antagonistic um what I find with the Democratic party is that while we fight them on different things we're still fighting them tooth and nail um but just on a different version of the fight well I think about this a lot and my mood changes about it a lot you know because I'm a human who's constantly evolving and growing but I feel I I I understand the people who are like voting doesn't matter in the presidential election I don't think it's an unreasonable perspective to have when you really pay attention to people's material realities and I think it's fair for people to want to vote based on their material realities I feel like for years now we have always been told to vote for quote the lesser of two evils um and I see things only getting worse as I've done that because I've done that you know I'm not I was a clown I voted for Biden I did you know because I was really like Dam maybe maybe we can do it you know like maybe this will have a real impact on a number of people not just myself but like the communities that I'm defending the communities I'm working with like I really hope that this will have a huge material change for them and it just didn't you know I don't think voting you know I'm also not the type of person to be like don't vote at all like I really think it's a people should make their own decisions about that but for me I'm more fixated and focused on local voting I'm more interested in referendums and I'm more interested in you know like ballot measures that people can vote on know I look at what's happening in Atlanta and I'm like there's a lot of differences as to whether or not that's the way to like try to stop cop City but I think when you're fighting racial capitalism you have to use every tool at your disposal and I also think if people are not going to vote it makes sense to do it in a way that's like organized and with other people and making clear because I'm like why should I continue voting for people who literally make the problem worse like they continue to contribute to the problem rather than provide Solutions the Democratic Party Never embraced um our work on the divestment from policing but you know they talk to it right so like I would you know what I would ask to you is like do who's better on policing right um in when we're talking about like the transformational on the ground kind of stuff as opposed to the rhetoric as you know so much of Criminal Justice policy is set at the local and state level you know most of what we think of as criminal laws and criminal adjudication in the court system happens at the state level uh the feds play a role and things like drug enforcement and some uh use of Rico not just to go after former presidents but but young people in communities listening to drill music who are labeled as gangsters and and the worst of the worst and prosecuted under these very permissive Rico statutes so but by and large funding for prisons the laws that drive prison rates the policies around policing the budgets of of policing these are local and state matters in addition you know the politics in Washington are pretty terrible and and I and there's not even someone running for office in most places who would really I think make it any better that what counts as a kind of progressive criminal justice uh policy is mostly procedural reformism the kind stuff that's in the Justice for George Floyd act which would have saved George's Floyd's life and probably anyone else's frankly uh this is this is a virtue signaling of A Sort uh but but more seriously it's it's it's just has the wrong premise it misunderstands the nature of policing it misunderstands the nature of the police problems we're up against and with the exception of a handful of very Progressive Le legislators like Corey bush like AO see uh there is not an appetite even among the Democrats to do anything that I would count as meaningful Criminal Justice Reform yeah so no obviously you know it's not that it's not that uh we we want the Republicans in office but we shouldn't kid ourselves in thinking that the mainstream of the democratic party is going to deliver us given the current political configuration much of anything that we want so as a result you know like let's look at what's going on in Atlanta right with cop City you've got an entirely Democratic local Administration whose crushing resistance as literally killing people for resisting is bringing crazy conspiracy charges and is suppressing people's right to vote uh and it's an African-American Democratic Administration so you know we have a bigger problem than the choice between two kind of neoliberal corporate parties and the result of that for me strategically is that I have really Double Down On basee Building rather than uh lobbying and policy advocacy in in Washington or frankly even even at the state level I do it some at the local level when they're sympathetic elected officials who I think really get it but I think we have to change the facts on the ground the way we're going to do that is through Base building so personally you know I'm working in LA county I'm working in Memphis I'm working here in New York City you know and I'm supporting struggles all over the country uh in whatever ways I can but I'm not spending a lot of time working with the the mainstream civil rights organizations the lobbyists in Washington even though you know I have friends there and I and I have people who who I think have the right analysis but I just don't see the point right now in investing a lot of energy in in federal policymaking uh because we're just not going to get anywhere so let's let's change the facts on the ground so that more people like Corey Bush can run for election and get elected and to Alexa's point about getting folk like Cory bush elected and what I mean by we can work with these people I recently helped support Cory bush in the unlock the Box campaign with their and solitary confinement act they recently introduced I want to be very clear these in Atlanta should be ashamed of themselves because it's all it's all out here running the game for this cop City right so like make no mistake that is a problem that is a challenge but also make no mistake if the white woman would have won over Andre Dickens um over here out here in Atlanta if Atlanta had a fully white um administrative body to go along with the fully white corporate uh overseers it wouldn't even have been a question they would have it wouldn't even have been a it wouldn't even have been a a a a chance to even engage with it the one thing I'll give the S the anti-democrat sentiment is that it LS to sleep yeah right it LS to sleep Dickens who I voted for Dickens here in Atlanta right because um it was between him and a clearly procop black woman like I I I you know I love y'all but y'all be getting away with some in the political Arena no carceral right some carceral it it was between him and an explicitly pro pro cop black women running for mayor in Atlanta after like all 75 of the other people got out the racist Atlanta's weird um and so I voted for him I didn't vote for him with the spirit of like you know this is the Revolution starting here in Atlanta I voted for him because I was the best person for the job but if another if if the procop woman would have won they' have they'd have shot more than one protester in that Forest you feel me yeah like like the the whole this is a this is a uh equation this is a ma there are massive elements to all these political actions and movements oh no no that was the what I was trying to get at is and so he got into office and a lot of went to sleep they went back to sleep right and so he's been running this game on cop City he got it I don't know what check he got or whether checks are going we know that cocacola and lock heat and all these people are paying $30 million and the city's paying 60 million I don't know where that 30 million is going you know don't clip me too much on like that cuz I don't know what's going to get used but my point is if if fell asleep when we got the right mayor in then after you finish voting it's your job to wake back up I'll just say the effect that my voice can have on local Atlanta politics explicitly tied to the fact that they share identities with me yeah the fact that they can't just look at me and say this this you know what I'm saying you know how they are or the these guys don't they can't do that to me I went to the same school as some of these I got the same background of some of these I look like some of these you know what I'm saying like you know like so we all are fundamentally a part of similar groups they can't just push me aside and call it the woke mind virus or whatever the uh Ronda Sanders is talking about uh fun so like that serves a functional there's a functional use to that in terms of actually advocating for the politics I need and want you saw in freaking what was that Tennessee where the brother stood up and tried to do something about gun violence and they just said y'all not rep y'all not Representatives anymore we voted y'all and that's hey hey you know what I'm saying and don't get me wrong like it's it's going on like right the the cop City petition that just ended right they're using they're they're they're using signature verification systems the Democrats in Atlanta are using signature verification systems that they refuse to use during the election so these snakes yeah they're snakes I get it I get what y'all are about to say that they're no different on X Y and Z levels but I have the capacity to critique that for with a whole different to a whole different level based on the fact that they are in not in community what's the word I want to use here that we are that there is a there there is at least an ostensible there at least ostensibly beholden to my political project you see what I'm saying and and and that does not happen if um the random white lady that keeps on running for Marinette laner is in office you know what I'm saying if the Republicans get controlled they can easily just say these 13% of the population these don't vote anyway I don't give the what y'all got to say if you have made it to the end of the video I just want to express to you how truly exhausted I am oh my God a  is tired this was a wild undertaking that has taken me months to complete and my closing thoughts are very similar to my opening thoughts there is no one siiz fits-all strategy or approach to voting or what you should do these are just the informed thoughts of me and a bunch of other people I know I hope you were able to derive something valuable from it and remember what I said take what you find valuable and discard the rest I hope those of you with the right to vote choose to exercise it and extra points if you exercise it against fascism if not I'll settle for you liking and sharing this video as well as following your
