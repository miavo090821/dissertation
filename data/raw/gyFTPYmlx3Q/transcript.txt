And I'm I'm not going to say any names, but I saw people who I personally knew saw mom Donnie flipping. They knew it and they acknowledged it with me. And what did they do? They pretended like they didn't see it on social media because of this [ __ ] political economy that we have on social media now. >> And and and these people have their I mean they get hundreds of thousands uh to to millions of views a day or a week. And they did it and they were using the mom donnie opium to gain views. and they were trying to wait until the very very very very very last moment to make the switch that they knew was inevitable instead of holding him accountable when they saw it coming. But by the time they started holding him accountable, it was too late. But they don't give a [ __ ] cuz they already made their money and got their followers and no one remembers how they lied and how they manipulated and everybody all the people in the comments even like, "Yeah, man, but are you going to talk about this? Are you going to talk about this? You going to talk about this?" And then they pretended to look the other way, right? Nobody remembers that. They just, "Oh [ __ ] this person's even more famous than they were. I don't know how it happened, but here we are." Yeah, they might have made a mistake, but that was just a mistake. And that's really the big the biggest thing is like people assuming that some of these uh journalists, these these public figures are they're making mistakes or they're just a little bit behind or they're just trying to they're trying to evolve. No, it's calculating. [music] Would you have freedom from wage [music] slavery then join in the grand industrial land?

Welcome everyone to another episode of Escaping the Cave with Dr. Gerrio. Today we have a very very special guest, my friend Nico House. Nico is the host of the For the People podcast. He's also one of the producers, founders, and content creators at Hotspot, something he does with our good friend Nick Cruz from the Revolutionary Blackout Network. Uh Nico, so much for Thank you so much for joining me today, brother. Hey man, I appreciate appreciate being on bro. It's a it's been a long time coming. It's been a long time coming. >> Indeed it has. I wanted to start by asking you about Mam Donnie because uh there was this interesting situation when uh he got elected or maybe some time before, but uh in the Instagram sphere that we're both very active in, there was so many leftists that I felt like were like Charlie Brown realling for the same trick over and over and over again. And it really did did feel in terms of people who do videos and don't just post memes because there's a lot of good comrades that that post memes and stuff but >> people who do videos it was like just you and me basically that I could see that were very >> basically he just started but yeah a couple of us >> yeah we we got an attack too. >> Oh my god. Yeah. We got the the comment section was insane. Um, it it almost felt unreal cuz if it's if I saw like a 19-year-old do it, I understood cuz they hadn't gone through Bernie, they hadn't gone through the disappointments of AOC and the squad. >> Yeah, exactly. >> Deepats that were in their mid30s that went through all of that >> that pretended to have learned the lessons and then remade the mistake as if nothing happened. So, can you tell me like what what was going through your mind in that moment? Cuz it was so infuriating for me. >> Well, I feel like the craziest part was that that trademark signature statement that everybody he hasn't even been elected yet. [laughter] >> How many times you see that in your comment, bro? He has I need to wait for him to get elected before I look at the [ __ ] he says. Like, I'm telling you what he's already said and what he's already done. I don't want to wait until he's elected for him to start screwing us over. Like, and I don't want him to wait till he's elected and has power before we start holding him accountable because we we've already seen where that leads. Like, one of the things that people forget about Bernie isn't just how he screwed us over and sold us out to Joe Biden, but the amount of power that he got for doing so and how he refused to hold Biden accountable after that, but also how people still refused to hold Bernie accountable after he got that power within the Democratic party and in the Senate because it was a trade-off that everybody likes to forget happened. But he got a lot of power and representation in the Senate and he used none of it to hold Biden accountable even though that's what he promised he would do when he endorsed Joe Biden. Mom Donnie and the situation with mom D especially in New York the home of AOC which is ironic. Um he for example got famous from pushing for the pro Palestine movement calling out Zionism like that was his bread and butter. But then he just kept throwing the Palestinian movement under the bus in various ways, whether it be talking about putting together an anti-semitic task force, uh, which is absolutely insane. Um, and I found it interesting, by the way, that he kept talking about all the initiatives that he's put together for anti-semitism or to combat anti-semitism. But you know, >> did you see did you see the AOC tweet today about uh anti-semitic protesters, >> bro? Yes. [laughter] You know, it's just really, you know, it's anti-semitic. You can't just scream Hamad like so. So, you're not going to talk you're not going to say anything about like the actual why the protests are happening. >> You're not going to say anything about the attacks uh from Israel and Palestine during a supposed ceasefire, right? Like, or you know, the fact that women just got executed. Like, we going to talk about that or Trump and Madoodle. Like, there's so many things you could talk about, but we're going to talk about the fact this person said these people are screaming Hamas. Like, what? [laughter] >> But that's kind of like But that's but that's M Donnie too, right? That's what rapper M Donnie >> he was saying that though that that type of rhetoric doesn't have any place here in New York or place in New York. And um uh he he he focuses on like fighting anti-semitism like because he gets he gets cornered and bullied in into doing so, right? But like that you should have prepared for that type of pressure the moment you decide to make pal Palestine the hill you're willing to die on. At least that's what you made made it seem like at the time. But instead he just keeps he just keeps cowing and and capitulating. And whenever um whenever I saw the election results and I saw how much he was talking about how much he wanted to help uh Jews and Zionists, I was confused cuz you would have thought that he was pitching he was he was um that he was what's the word I'm looking for? Oh, catering to black people the whole time because black people got him elected, right? And he has not he's not said anything about what he's going to do for the disenfranchised black people in the city. >> And I don't like that's not a coincidence. It's cuz we don't really have the the influence uh on social media or at least in New York on social media with the fi with finances and things like that outside the organizing of the Democratic party, right? And so he can get our votes and throw us under the bus. And even if the majority of Zionists voted against him, he still has to capitulate to them. Why? Because they're paying our bills. >> And that is what I was trying to get people to see. Like I was show were talking about how they're billionaires that were funding super PACs for him. And I'm thinking to myself, I said, "Okay, well maybe he doesn't know about it, but he knows now cuz everybody's talking to him about it. So if he just comes out and condemns them, then I won't have a problem cuz he it's not like he can control a super PAC getting started in his name and somebody taking money for it." Okay. So condemn them. So condemn them. So condemn. We're Okay. Okay. So you're just going to ignore that [ __ ] We talk about it and we get in trouble for it. >> Mhm. By the same people that were flaunting how much money billionaires put towards his opponents. [ __ ] Look at how much they put towards him. >> How many millions of dollars did the working families party give him? And who funds that party? >> Alex Soros. >> Bro, it was like this Jewish super pack that Alice Soros put together that um funded the working families party. They funded super PACs in Mom Donny's name. And what was crazy about that whole situation with Alexos was like there this was happening all behind the scenes as mom Donnie was saying that he didn't want any money from billionaires. He made it very clear as he didn't want any money or support from them. And then he posts a photo with Alex Soros >> or rather Alex Soros posts a photo and it was taken well beforehand allegedly. Right. So it's like so you knew that this would would have been a bad look and that's why he didn't post it. And then we found out that actually a billionaire has been pulling the [ __ ] strings on the puppet this whole time. And people were still like waited. I was telling like even as not look as much as I would like for him to be in charge of trains and and the metro and things like that. I was tell people at the time like that's not I don't actually have any expectations in that regard but I do wish that he would stop lying and pretend like he has control over that just to get votes cuz when everybody everybody's like oh man it's a fail promise whenever the metro prices went up I said no it's not I mean yeah it is technically but it was never a promise that should have been considered legitimate cuz he has no control OVER IT. THE STATE GOVERNMENT RUNS THAT [ __ ] COMPLETELY, BRO. The governor runs that [ __ ] and signed off on it ultimately. And instead of being upfront and honest about that, I'm sure he knew that. He did it. He He was just like, "Let people believe that they were voting for cuz these the people who take the metro every day in New York, bro, that's going to determine the election." >> Mhm. Yeah. You know, >> he should be like, "We're going to advocate and we're going to we're going to lobby Governor Koshel or Hosel to to change that system and keep the prices low or lower the prices." That's what he should have said. But that's not what he said. >> And it was purposely deceptive. Just like him talking about using his [ __ ] or or leaning into this stereotype that using his hands to eat is somehow a Muslim thing. Well, that has nothing to do with the [ __ ] Muslim heritage, bro. That's just [ __ ] African heritage. He's like, but I'm going just keep Yeah, man. You know, this how we eat IN TRADITIONAL MUSLIM. WHAT? THAT'S NOT NO, but you were leaning into it. Why? Because [ __ ] maybe if if I don't lean into this, people might start paying attention to my an my pro-ionist stances. So, >> you know who won him? Who won him the election? Also, the Republicans. They made him so base. They called him like a [ __ ] mauist jihadist or something. And for a population that is so sick and tired of the establishment, you give them the freakiest thing you can give them and they'll vote for it. And and that's what's sad. That that's one of the things I tried to focus on in my commentary about it. People are always like, you know, you talk about a purity fetish so much, but don't you have a purity fetish here? You're rejecting him because he doesn't have the perfect policies. And I'm like, [ __ ] you can run Stalin in a Democratic party ticket and give me the policies of the 1936 Soviet Constitution. But I still wouldn't support it because what makes something left is not like just policies in my view. It's how you relate to the system. And the Democrats are the system par excellence as >> how you actually understand the system, right? Because we have evidence now. This isn't and we have like contemporary evidence. I know like maybe some people want to point to like maybe Henry Wallace, right? How he got screwed by the party. Oh, this a different party now. Okay. Yeah, but Bernie was 2016, bro. How much evidence do we have since Bernie, Elizabeth Warren, AOC, Obama, for example? I mean, the list goes on. And then out of after like after Biden failed so many times, playerizing sex. I mean, dude, it's a literal segregationist. Yeah. So, man, how we going how we going to hold him accountable for that? We're going to make him the president, y'all. Yeah. And so, if Stalin was dumb enough to run that party, he's too dumb to [ __ ] be my president. Like cuz there's no way that you believe that there's any re like I'm not I'm a revolutionary but I don't believe that reform is possible within the Democratic party guys. >> No, it's not. >> That's what's crazy. Even if you're a reformist okay >> we need to reform the National Socialist Labor Party of Germany in the 1930s. That's what the Germans needed to reform Hitler's party. It's We just need to reform that party. >> Reform them, guys. Well, if we could in the middle of the night, man. Well, we tried. And now that we could have seen it coming. Yeah, you could have. It was pretty obvious what his plans were. Yeah, but I feel like you're being a little bit negative, man. I just feel like you're a little bit of a nihilist. And [laughter] >> it made you feel like the they make you feel like the meme where everyone's having a party and you're in the corner. I don't know if you've seen the meme and you're like what they don't know as they're having they're all having fun. They're all dancing. What they don't know is that he's actually [ __ ] or something. And that's what that's what felt bad at that moment, which was like, >> man, I hate being the party pooper, but somebody's got to do it. >> Somebody's got to force people to take the the hard pills. >> Bro, I hate being a party. People think like, oh man, you just love being there. I'm like, no. They're like, "Oh, you couldn't wait to say." I'm like, "No, I actually said at the very beginning of all this, bro, I don't really want to do this, but I got to because it's my job." And like, and also, it's a responsibility at that point when I see no one else. And I'm I'm not gonna say any names, but I saw people who I personally knew saw mom Donnie flipping. They knew it and they acknowledged it with me. And what did they do? They pretended like they didn't see it on social media because of this [ __ ] political economy that we have on social media now. >> Mhm. >> And and and these people have their I mean they get hundreds of thousands uh to to millions of views a day or a week. And they did it and they were using the mom Donnie opium to gain views and they were trying to wait until the very very very very last moment to make the switch that they knew was inevitable instead of holding him accountable when they saw it coming. >> But by the time they started holding him accountable, it was too late. But they don't give a [ __ ] cuz they already made their money and got their followers and no one remembers how they lied and how they manipulated. And everybody come, all the people in the comments even like, "Yeah, man, but are you going to talk about this? Are you going to talk about this? You going to talk about this?" And they pretended to look the other way, right? Nobody remembers that. They just, "Oh [ __ ] this person's even more famous than they were. I don't know how it happened, but here we are." Yeah, they might have made a mistake, but that was just a mistake. And that's really the big the biggest thing is like people assuming that some of these uh journalists, these public figures are making mistakes or they're just a little bit behind or they're just trying to they're trying to evolve. No, it's calculated. Friends, we live under a dictatorship of capital still, which means that in order to keep up the work that we're doing, we need financial contributions. There's many different ways in which you can help us financially. You can become a Patreon at patreon.com/midwesternarks. [music] You can buy some of our books, which you can find at midwestermarks.com/books. You can sign up for my classes and the other classes we offer with our Marxism School, which you can see at the Midwestern Marks [music] selfie page. You can also support my work personally as a writer and everything else that I do through Substack at my Substack page, which is philosophy in [music] crisis. In addition, if you want to support the American Communist Party financially, [music] you can also donate to the party at ACP. If you want to subscribe to the party's journal, which I am the chief editor of, you can do so at redamea.acp. [music] us. And if you can't support us financially at all, at least help us get our message out there. Share this program on your social media. Share it with your friends and family [music] and co-workers and get it out as far and wide as possible. We thank you, dear. >> Yeah, it's a structural component. It's a structural component of how it functions. And you mentioned something very important there, the the attention economy in social media. What do they call us? They call us influencers. But there's a dialectic there because the influencers are influenced by the people who they influence. Uh because if if your if your base like like say someone like Hassan, if your base stops donating, if your base stops [ __ ] with you because you change the angle that they have come to to love from you, that's your job. That's you disappointing a certain extent your your boss. So there's this interesting dialectical uh uh interreation between both parts like the influencer always have to keep has to keep in mind what's the base going to say and that's why I think we were talking a little bit about this uh before we started the program the way that grifters are are filtered out in time the way that people realize if your point is not to be an influencer if you're a revolutionary to the core and you're just doing this influencing [ __ ] because it's a good way to spread ideas you wipe your ass with the the [ __ ] comment section of a bunch of people telling you, "Oh, you have a purity fetish because you don't like his policies or they're not perfect or this." No, you say what you have to say and you say it with your chest. Even if it's unpopular, even if it leads people to unfollow you or to hate in the comments because your point is not just to gain followers. The ultimate point is always to carry out this revolutionary process. Oh, you're muted. You're muted. >> There we go. There. You're good. >> Oh, not my >> Oh, you sound far away. >> Uh, can I say something? >> Something >> something. >> Okay, I can hear you now. But that's weird. I don't know what just happened. >> The audio the kind of cut out though. The like the quality of your microphone changed to how it was before. >> Hold on. My microphone just went out. One second. One sec. >> Real quick, but my my microphone went out. Give me one second. >> This was all Zionist interference. That's getting too. >> All right. >> This my This is my AirPod and I'm about to put my mic back on. That was weird. What the hell? >> Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. >> But um I was saying that like I actually take the title influencers very serious from the from the jump because honestly the how I got my initial success was through was through influence. Yeah. >> Doing some doing something and making a stand because I people think that the situation with Bernie whenever I exposed the cheating for the Democratic party was all like roses and [ __ ] No. Do you know how many people's feet I was stepping on? How many people had planned on riding that train to another career and now because of me they were forced to make a public choice as to whether or not they were going to ignore the cheating or or call it out. >> Mhm. if they were going to stay with the Democratic party that they just got a job in or leave and stay on business. Like they don't I was being attacked for forcing them to make that choice by calling out the cheating. I'm like, well, no. I mean, it's they're cheating. I mean, I was forced to make a choice. It was a pretty easy one. I didn't get [ __ ] But there are a lot of people who weren't thinking like that and I can't even necessarily blame them. But when I made the decision to be the influencer, my job isn't to say [ __ ] six months after everybody already figured it out. I can't stand that [ __ ] I, bro, I can't stand it. Like, I I can't because >> I would rather if y'all hate me for some [ __ ] I said six months in advance and then everybody thought I was crazy then, but then and but then for y'all to like me because of some [ __ ] I said six months later after everybody figure it out. Like I I can't stand it. Like, and I love being able to go back six months ago, seven months ago, two, three, four, five years ago and be like, "Shit, I was on I that's on the nose. Damn." I can see why everybody was mad. I can understand because I was so right. And that it's a it's hard to accept whenever somebody is that [ __ ] right about something that you don't want to accept. >> I get it. And but at the same time, >> like I don't believe that Hassan isn't an influencer. Like he became a communist because he saw where the [ __ ] movement was headed. >> Communist, whatever. [ __ ] He ain't really a communist, but he he doesn't believe in the principles uh or he he doesn't have any type of ideological ideological consistency, especially when it comes to him being a communist. Because if you actually were an influencer and a communist, then you wouldn't be operating with and organizing within the Democratic party. >> 100%. Yeah. >> Like those two things don't work together. Why? Because the Democratic party is still influencing you. And the Communist Party and Communist ideology influence you, but you are not an influencer who happens to be communist. >> Exactly. Yeah. No, I couldn't agree more. You made a point there about uh being pissed off when people get it. uh when 6 months after is when they start saying the [ __ ] you've been saying for a minute. Uh my buddy Eddie, he calls that hindsight anti-imperialism because the same things hap happens across the political spectrum. People become anti-war years after the fact when they were the ones that lambasted the people that have been saying what they're saying now years after when it was actually happen happening which is when it matters. >> The [ __ ] do I care how you feel about the Iraq war now? I care about how you feel about the war against Venezuela now >> or the leading up or the leading up to right like because how many of us have been talking about the situation in Venezuela for I mean I've been focused on bro I've been spending years talking about Venezuela >> like a lot because I was telling I'm like y'all this [ __ ] >> the US is getting very very unpredictable and and anxious because they see what's happening in China they see what's happening in Russia and the US and the west is losing power in Eastern Europe the Middle in Africa. >> So it's yeah, they're beating their chest in Venezuela and I don't think we can win that war with Venezuela, but that doesn't mean they're going to try some [ __ ] >> That doesn't mean they're not going to try. They're still going to try because they don't have a choice at this point. It's either enter in bil bilateral mutually beneficial negotiations with other countries that they they normally and otherwise wouldn't engage with or go try to take these resources by force like we always have uh and risk failing. They're still going to choose a ladder every single time. every single time because they because if they enter in bilateral negotiations that means you actually have to compete and we know the one thing a capitalist hates >> more than liberty >> is competition. >> Yep. [laughter] >> Like that's just that's just reality. Right. Right. Like capitalism is foundationalized on eliminating competition, not not cultivating it. >> Absolutely. And that's that's what's interesting because they still have to keep up the pretense of being pro competition and fair trade and all this [ __ ] It's like, well, if you actually want competition and [ __ ] that trade with like respect for the other party that they're trading with, you see that in communist China. You don't see that in the US. >> You don't see that in the US. But >> I want to ask you about uh the Democrats in general because there's this interesting phenomenon. I felt like I I I wonder what you think about this, but there was a moment during the Joe Biden administration where there was a lot of Republicans that were making the pretense, especially a lot of MAGA ones that they were the anti-war ones, the anti-defate and and the real denters and all this other [ __ ] And it was all complete uh bunk, but they played a structural role as the uh the valve, the the pressure valve where descent would operate through. Now those cats are the establishment. Now those cats are in some ways just keeping the train going because it's not just tr it's it's a continuity of the imperialist system and there's a lot of uh discontent with ICE which even for the MAGA people that's not what he promised. He had promised to to kick out just criminals and and drug dealers and regular working class. Anyone who looks brown is fair game to be harassed by these [ __ ] >> Oh, no. It's even crazier. And now I said I saw on Twitter the other day. I said, "Yo, white people getting shot in the [ __ ] street on camera, y'all. Oh, no. The US is cooked. The US cuz that was a one demographic. Lo, that was a one demographic that everybody was like, they untouchable. No [ __ ] [ __ ] ain't going to change." So white women get shot. >> Oh [ __ ] And now [ __ ] in the street talking about exercising their Second Amendment right to defend themselves against ISIS in the state, dog. >> So soccer moms, and nothing against soccer moms, they're great for communities, but white soccer moms are out here talking about we need another 1776 and they they gave us the Second Amendment for a reason and all this stuff. And >> what I'm the thing that scares me the most is if the Democrats are able to capture this disscent and hijack it because now that's how they're trying to present themselves as the Republicans did during Joe Biden's administration as the the force of disscent. Um do you think they're going to be capable of pulling something like that as they did uh with the end of the first Trump administration >> or do people learn >> be split again? I think it'll be split again overall. I mean because I mean Minnesota for example the demographics they're already like this is how you knew everything happening in Minnesota is like it's a it's a scop >> by the Trump administration uh because and normally when they when they are trying to influence something they go into areas where they know they're going to get a bunch of support doing it or or like the base largely supports Trump or at least enough of the base largely supports Trump. uh and they will attack people that the b his base traditionally has traditionally not recently started attacking. Um and this situation in Minnesota is actually just another anomaly in a sense that he went into Minnesota with the Democratic governor which is normal. Um, well, that part is normal, but he went to Minnesota and started attacking white people, but he the reason why he went to Minnesota is even stranger because, you know, everybody knows that this this Somalian fraud scam, which by the way, uh, seemed like this massive fraud case that everybody's talking about, um, that was just prosecuted. It was actually [ __ ] done by a white woman, which is a whole different thing, but whatever. All right. Um, he but the the core of his argument is that we got to get these Somalians out of Minnesota. These moms have been in Minnesota for [ __ ] 15 or 20 years, >> dog. Like I I remember about 10 12 years ago when I went to I flew into Minneapolis airport and it was full of Somalians. That was the first time I had actually seen Somalians in person before. And I had asked like, "Hey, where you from?" And she's like, "Oh, Somalia." I'm like, "Oh." She's like, "That's my cousin. Here's my friend. They're all Somalia." I'm like, "What? Do you have like a lot of people who live here?" She's like, "Yeah, there's a lot of us." Like, "Why would >> the news have been so good? that was promised to us 3,000 years ago was >> right. [laughter] >> But I'm so whenever I hear Trump all of a sudden talking about how problematic some lives have been for this community that have they have never caused any problems in >> to the point where people are coming out to defend them, the white people in their community are coming out to defend them. >> I was confused. And then you find out Trump has been bombing the [ __ ] out of Somalia for this last year. Like bombing the dogs, bro. Bombing. They even sent a general, I want to say it was to encourage more bombing in Putland because they, you know, that's where the the illegal black market gold trade comes out of. But it's also the only area that the US doesn't have control over because the the the actual government of of Somalia, they do have control over, but there's a border there where the the the regular government doesn't have control over and but there's a lot of gold, a lot of other resources there. And that those resources or that goal in particular actually is mostly exported to the UAE. So the UAE is helping to conduct a so and there's going to be more and more. And so what does the US always do whenever they are engaging in some [ __ ] [ __ ] They're engag engaging in an imperialist campaign and they need support or they at least don't want people to pay attention and don't want people to condemn it. They create an air of apathy so that you think that those people deserve it. Look at all these dirty [ __ ] Look at look at all the problems they're causing in our country. Instead of thinking, hold up, could it be that they're all in our country because of the [ __ ] we're doing right now >> with the Yeah. with the Haitians. Uh the they're eating the dogs, they're eating the cats right before the intervention. >> Before the intervention. >> Yeah. >> And I'm like, and you would think that people would start paying attention because um I always tell people, you yall know these were living in Minnesota during Trump's first term and he never said [ __ ] >> Never. with all the think about all the news that we got uh about Elan Omar at the time because Trump and her were constantly ne at at each other's necks >> and and she's from Minnesota like and yet there was no spotlight shown on how dominant and prominent the Somalian community was there which which is ironic because you would think that they would have got it because that was the way she got elected was because of how prominent the Somali community is there right but like it never got discussed >> and all of a sudden Now, in the last 3 to four years, Somali are causing all the problems in Minnesota. Even though no one the governor isn't saying that, the people aren't saying that. No one's saying that. It's just Trump who doesn't live there. >> Mhm. >> But fraud. Nick Shirley just conveniently decides to show up on this in December at the end of December. But they're training. They're talking about recruiting mercenaries for ICE to go into this to Minnesota for this operation before Nick Shirley exposes fraud, which the majority of it looks like it's [ __ ] Nick Shirley goes to a daycare on December 22nd and nobody was there. What? He went to a daycare during the holidays and nobody was there [laughter] >> in the snow. Yeah. Uh no, I'm not. Why would I do that? Like I'm not if I if I could and I know I'm going to be home or I have other people home. Why would I put You being a parent understand this. I'm not about to pay for that last two weeks of daycare. If I can get away with it, if there's a, you know what I'm saying? Like, or if I'm not trying to get up out of my bed at 7:00 in the morning, if I'm going to be at home if I cuz I've been doing this for the last year, bro. I'm in the crib. They upstairs sleeping. I'm not about to wake them up if I don't have to go to work. If I'm They going to stay there right in the house and it's cold as hell outside. But no, he exposed for No, I've not seen anybody come in or out. Yeah, cuz everybody at the crib cuz they're on vacation, you dumbass. Like but people but Nick Sh just blows up. Everybody assumes that everything he reported is 100% accurate and all of a sudden that gives I mean bro you got we just saw women get executed because of Nick Shirley 23-year-old random white guy with no credentials. Carlos in some YouTube videos >> when you really put that in perspective it's like what the [ __ ] is happening in that country bro? I couldn't agree more, man. This um these ICE thugs, which if you're going around with guns and you're masked up, you're a thug. There's only one institution historically that would go around masked up in the US uh terrorizing people and it was the clan. And uh if you're looking at these cats and I I look, Democrats are always talking about the deportations and Trump and then they look away when Biden deports people. So at the beginning of this, I wasn't fully fully sold that it was something a radical break with the Democrats or anything like that. And then I teach in a pime primarily brown and black area. Most of my students are brown and black. And I start getting a ton of students, half of my classes telling me we got pulled over >> for no reason other than being brown, being Pakistani, being Indian or it's what >> once you start once it gets to that level the same [ __ ] >> She lives in Georgia out there in um you know right outside Atlanta where all the Mexicans live in uh Gainesville and uh yeah she's like no my dad got put over three times in the last month. >> I was like what? her dad like never gets he drives slow as [ __ ] dog. And he drives a nice car. And she's like, "No, you got we're terrified to leave the house cuz you know, even if everything is right, it doesn't matter. That's not the They will still kill your ass. They will still hold you and not let you call anybody." Oh, I forgot my ID in the house. [laughter] Well, I think we found out at the detention center. Come on, let's go check it out. >> And it cuts across class divides. It'll be kids that uh their uncle owns a car dealership and they're driving a nice car. And then it'll also be poor kids driving an old ass U Alult Ultima or something. >> Both as long as you're not white. But even now, even [ __ ] white people. >> But I just saw a video on IG, bro. I just saw a video of this white woman getting arrested and thrown to the ground on IG. They grab her cell phone, throw that [ __ ] like, and they let her go after they finally let her grab her ID. But they terrorized her ass beforehand. >> I'm like, "Yo, which is stupid, by the way, on ISIS part." This is how you know the IDF. This has got to be some IDF [ __ ] right? Yeah. >> Cuz IDF don't know. They don't know. Like, okay, man. Look, you can go after black people, brown people, even a white man if his hair is long enough or his barber is too thick or his barber his uh his uh >> the Jesus looking ones. >> Yeah. You know what I'm saying? Like, but don't [ __ ] with those white women. Don't touch them. You better You go around them. You maneuver, but you don't touch them. You don't don't look at them. Yeah. Yeah. We don't give a [ __ ] about that. POP. GET ON THE GROUND. LIKE, oh [ __ ] Now the whole world watching. Look what you did. We would We would have never even seen it. Those those little the the videos of them arresting or going door to door, knocking on Somali doors would just went to the same people they always went to. You know what I'm saying? Like, but now you kill a white woman. So now you got to call her a domestic terrorist. You got to overcorrect and call her a [ __ ] domestic terrorist, bro. >> Because we can scare the white woman. I don't know what the [ __ ] we This is what we got to do. We have to literally lie about the [ __ ] that we're that we all saw happen right in front of us. JD Vans is so upset that people like, "Oh, I can't believe that. She was he she deserved to die." I'm like, "Bro, you're beating your chest about what should have happened, how he was defending himself, and how she definitely is a terrorist. She was trying to hit." I'm like, "Okay, so what why don't you cite any protocol, any law that substantiates your claim? Nothing at all. Even though all the information is readily available because if he quotes even like any of it, it's going to immediately undermine his point." And we can't have that. Why? Cuz we just killed a [ __ ] white woman, dog. I'm I'm on I'm at the end of my rope. We're done. We like kidnapping Maduro. [ __ ] Some of the country cheered, >> you know? But if you look at a lot of Yeah. Yeah, you get like the the mainstream uh conservative talking heads are, you know, they're they're doing what they're paid for. But I will say like everybody that's on Twitter or even on on uh Instagram, if they do comment supporting what that cop or what that officer did, YouTube, it's all bots, bro. It's straight [ __ ] bots. >> It's It is obvious. I'm like, yo, I even tweeted out the other day like, "We need better bots. Y need to like if y'all going to bot us bot attack us like y'all saying different versions of the n-word. You stupid little Democrat. Uh you're untang. You're [ __ ] Okay. So like that's really all y got. This is this where we're at now? Well [ __ ] account. >> Hey. Yeah. Hey, we had TO PUT THIS [ __ ] UP TODAY, MAN. WE A WHITE WOMAN TO GET SHOT. [ __ ] WHAT YOU WANT US TO DO? WE JUST PROGRAM. [laughter] >> You know you know what the there's always a silver lining, Nico, as you all know. You know what the silver lining of this is? The standup bits that Dave Chappelle is going to do are going to be so good. >> Yeah, bro. He been going crazy. He He has not He has not missed since he's come back. >> Yeah. >> And I'm so happy, bro, cuz I would have I don't know if I could have made it if if we would have lost D Chappelle to the Empire. >> Oh, ain't going to lie to you. I I don't know if I would have made it cuz I would I would have That [ __ ] would have hurt. That would have hurt too much. >> It would have hurt too much, dog. I can't believe like it's like Netflix is kind of like in this weird compromising position cuz like I'm sure they're like man they going somebody get on our head for keep letting this man talk but he makes us so much [ __ ] money. [laughter] >> It's hard not to make a good anti-Semitic joke right now. >> Yeah. Right. That part too, right? It's it's like like it's the people support this [ __ ] Like I know that the and and it's like and they paying our subscriptions. These [ __ ] scientists ain't got enough money to pay for all the subscriptions these poor people paying for even if they are sharing accounts. Okay. >> [laughter] >> while you're playing with it. It's a we ain't our billionaires don't keep Netflix alive. >> Mhm. >> Like it's facts unfort Like the reality is they overcharging us. It's like well [ __ ] I'm not about to pay for cable so this is where we at unfortunately like you know unless you you one of them team args you out there on the on this on the web the internet see like [ __ ] Jack Sparrow. I respect you. I'm not I'm not you know not judging. [laughter] You know what I'm saying? I like a good torrent website myself. But the reality is like I love seeing how like Dave Chappelle has hit that level of popularity but they can't do anything about it >> because everything he's saying the majority of us support >> which is true. So >> absolutely I want to ask you uh to to close off a question that I asked um I believe two guests ago now Ethan Leven commentator on Russia and Palestine etc. I asked him if he thinks we're heading towards civil war and uh he said that he thinks Americans are too fat and lazy to do to do anything anytime soon. That he he thinks that uh World War II is probably more likely. And >> I I don't know what's I don't know what's sadder if it's this the Civil War or that we're maybe too fat and lazy to do a civil war. But it >> What are your thoughts? Where where's the country heading? >> They're not heading to the gym. That's the [ __ ] problem actually. They they and they probably going to head right to McDonald's because you know them protests they long and they leave you leave you [laughter] starving and ain't a ain't nobody got enough money to hit a Whole Foods. So this is where we [laughter] he's not lying. It's a for like it's like a CIVIL WAR WITH WHO FOR WITH WHO AGAINST who exactly? What these all these [ __ ] political commentators on social media they're going to get in the fight? Is that is that what y'all hoping for? Like no it's not going to happen. I don't believe that we'll be in a civil war unless it's like people against the government. >> Yeah. >> Like and it's going to be like something that the government forced >> like the the government killed the wrong person to the wrong with from the wrong family and those people had a bunch of friends and now it's like and then they killed a couple more like on some K state [ __ ] and and Trump is already an unlikable individual. No one's gonna feel guilty. And then in the and the reason why I say the versus the government is more likely cuz there are so many people in the military who will say [ __ ] them. They will throw they're like [ __ ] I don't even like going to work as it is. Give me a reason to say [ __ ] y'all cuz legally speaking the everybody military can object conscientiously. They don't have to fight. >> Yeah. Yeah. >> And they you can't fire them. And every like what do you think the judge is going to say? the judges aren't and in today's climate, they're not going to be like, "Oh, we just want to completely ignore UCMJ because Trump asked us to." No, they're not going to do that. So, >> you're seeing these clashes. You're seeing the clashes happen with Trump and ICE is basically his personal security force at this point and governors and and the National Guard of States and that I I think it's sewing the foundations. And for me, the big question is who's going to be able to win? how the narrative uh about what the red line is is right. Are the Democrats going to succeed in making it a red blue thing or are people like us going to succeed in making it a people versus capital and the state thing? >> I think it'll be that I I think and the reason why maybe 10 years ago, maybe even 15 years ago under Obama, it would have been possible because there were enough people still making money. The housing market wasn't where it's at. Bro, credit cards are insane, bro. I had to just pay one off the other month because I'm like, "Hold up, [ __ ] Why am I paying $75 a month now when it was like $35?" Well, interest rates just went up. How? I have a great credit score. What What did I do to deserve this? Nothing. [laughter] Nothing. We just raised them up cuz we broke. So, you got to feel it, too. And everybody know everybody's talking about bankruptcy. Like, daycare is expensive as [ __ ] It's hard to send your kids to college. It's hard. It's hard to send them to work. It's everybody's It's nuts where we're at right now. And what I I believe that capitalism has a fatal flaw in its in its ideology, which is when you rip people's lives apart, you end up bringing them closer together. They have to form a support system uh based on common values and even some of the values they didn't know they had in common, they begin to develop through their shared experience and their shared trauma. Once that starts to happen, everybody starts getting on the same page. Once everybody starts getting on the same page, what the [ __ ] do you think is gonna happen? What do what do you think is this? Why like we know why y'all work so hard to control social media algorithms? We know for I tell people all the time I said people need to consider the fact the real possibility Charlie Kirk was killed at the time he was killed because they needed some [ __ ] for people to argue about and make it Democrat versus Republican left versus right because at a for for the first time in history bro that I can remember >> like the entire world was unifying against Israel they everybody from both sides. I never in my life would imagine that Candace would have the number one [ __ ] podcast in the world from criticizing Israel all the time. Like that's basically what she does for a living >> and I [ __ ] support it. I do support that. That's for damn sure. Right. And it's like for me to put my differences, not they're not petty, but they are differences aside because I understand like whatever Israel is doing, it is more important that Candace calls that out with a with a microphone and a platform that she has than us resolving my issues on her my my issues with her views on racism right now. That [ __ ] could come later. Like I got to that point. Why? Because we all agreed these [ __ ] got to go. like and we all have to do our part and I got to put my petty differences aside. So when Charlie got killed, that was why they were like, "Hey man, we got to get these [ __ ] arguing again. Come up with something cuz even with the algorithms, it wasn't working. Even with the ADL on their ass, it wasn't working. Even with they were buying chat GPT and Meta like all that [ __ ] like Yeah, it wasn't working. So like they they they doing event after event after event cuz it was Oh [ __ ] I would make an argument that it was Gaza and even Epstein files to some degree, right? Like we got to get people to stop talking about this [ __ ] And unfortunately the reality is to a large degree it worked, >> right? >> Yeah. >> They It did work. Um you know there are a lot of us that still talk about Gaza all the time but >> it's not enough. It isn't dominating the news cycle. The genocide is happening still and it isn't dominating the news cycle because every [ __ ] week Trump throws some [ __ ] at us and then Elon forces us to [ __ ] eat it. >> Yeah. And that's reality. But it still isn't working to the degree that they think that they thought it would because there's still like Trump is all time history unpopular right now regardless on social media >> and and it's almost like they're overplaying their hand by using all these bots to try and push him because we all know we're like [ __ ] everybody is criticizing this [ __ ] bro in Brazil the boss Odishas I know are attacking this man >> when they used to like him. Mhm. >> They're like, "No, this [ __ ] is like even for us like he's he's walling." Like, "Yeah, because they and once again, which we which we've seen over and we've seen people discuss this like the opposition in Venezuela and people who maybe didn't support Maduro, they're still not stupid enough to believe that the US getting involved in the way that they did will somehow benefit them because they're like, "Well, if they're in control of everything, >> how will I well, how will I be able to be autonomous?" Well, you won't. That's what people don't understand about Venezuela. They painted the opposition as if it was Maria Gorina Machado or even Juan Guo in his time. That's a very small fraction of the opposition. A very extreme one and a very super hardcore Zionist one. The vast majority of the opposition doesn't want Maluda to be overthrown by the US and their country bombed. If they beat the Chavishas, they want it to be on the merit of their ideas, their ability to organize. They're not going to succeed. I don't think they they are. There's only like one state that they have out of 25, but uh they're not fundamentally traders. They don't want to be cucks to the US. >> That's and I you know what that's why I tell people I'm like I don't have a a genuine problem with having opposition in Venezuela. Y'all think that's my issue. It's not. You don't want to be communist and you want your policy to pass. Get out there and engage the political system. I'm I actually appreciate that because it makes everybody have to level up >> and you're going to figure out really what the people want when they constantly show you over and over again by voting >> in a system that is like what? Like bro, whatever h is happening in Venezuela, people have to think about it. We just watched the president get kidnapped and it was this big we what we thought was going to be a huge hole in a vacuum of power and it could have created chaos. It should have based off of what we've heard from the US and what people say about the success and the popularity of the opposition party that supposedly won by this massive percentage and Maduro just stole the election. Instead, we didn't get that. We just saw the most mundane humrum. Hey, I'm the president now. Opposition, you got anything to say about this? No, we're cool with it. Anybody got anything to say about this? No, we're all COOL WITH IT. EVERYBODY IS COOL WITH THIS. YEAH, WE'RE ALL GOOD. OKAY. SO, you're not going to try to take advantage of this and like install a president and say that we're No. No. We're not doing none of that [ __ ] >> That's But that's the weirdest dictatorship I have ever seen. >> Yeah. [laughter] >> I'm like that you trying to tell me this. They say that this is a crumbling democracy and they just literally in like they their president got kidnapped overnight after the U the US engaged in countless countless countless years of propaganda investing money in it like bro. Yep. And Maria Machado Guanguo. Yeah. Yeah. And we just literally just did a mundane live stream to transition to power where the where the vice president is like yeah but he's still the president. The Supreme Court comes out and was like, "Yeah, normally we'll hold an election. We're not going to cuz he's still the president." >> Mhm. >> Like >> the weirdest dictator ever. >> The opposition didn't complain. >> Mhm. >> No, they were in the streets with the millions of chavistas complaining about the US's actions, >> not what the government was doing to sustain the Bolivarian revolution. It's It's the weirdest dictatorship I've ever seen. The dude's been arming his people. >> He's been training them. I've been to Venezuela twice. I'm friends with dozens and dozens of cadres, local leaders, higher level leaders, and I'm seeing it in my feed for months. These people are being trained and armed, regular civilians. They get to just sign up. Here's your weapon. Here's your training. That's a weird dictatorship. >> Yep. Yeah. Yeah. What dictators are people that supposedly want to overthrow them? That [ __ ] is a weird brass. I'm like, y'all don't understand how [ __ ] crazy. That's how why one the same reason I said that there was no on January 6 I'm like that isn't a [ __ ] >> a coup or what do they call it what do they keep calling it um from January 6 insurrection I'm like a bunch of conservatives show up with no guns and supposedly wanted to take over the government >> I don't think that math is math and arithmatically speaking my guy I don't think that makes a lot of sense the same way a dictator wouldn't give the people who supposedly want to overthrow him a bunch of guns and training to match right like that doesn't make any sense But what it does, but I'll tell you this though, what that does help me understand is why the US won't put boots on the [ __ ] ground. >> And I tell people, I'm like, "Yeah, they Why do you think they did this little little slick ass action in the middle of the night like it's cuz they were bumping their chest about how they Yeah, we go to war with Venezuela and we would Okay. I said, "Yeah." And I said, "Just because they did this [ __ ] doesn't mean they're still willing to go to war with Venezuela. They're doing everything they can right now to not go to war with Venezuela. Even putting out these fake ass um um >> uh success. Like when he said uh we got uh what two days worth of oil. HE HAD TWO DAYS WORTH OF PETROLEUM. GUYS, I TOLD you this is going to help America. I'm like and people were tweeting and [ __ ] like this this >> is what I voted for. Huh? two days worth of oil. Y'all, you tell me we just How much did we spend to do the operation and how much are we spending to maintain the operation thus far? That two days worth of oil is going to be worth it. Guys, explain that [ __ ] to me. [laughter] >> It's what's interesting is that I mean pe people really do not understand economics. Um and what's a lot of these writers are are the ones that will tell communists or Marxists like you guys don't know economics. You just don't know economics. Do you think that these palenteer guys, these ghouls that are behind Trump are going to suddenly become industrialists and develop whole new factories and refineries to pump out more Venezuelan oil? No, they just want control over the oil so that they can take out loans and use it as collateral >> because that's how money is being made. industrial reductionist. Like our goal is to reduce like our our the way that we gain our billions of dollars into one, two, three modes of of of earning like in in productivity. Like if we can if I can cut out as many people as I can cut out the middleman, which is us, >> I'mma do it every single time. And if I could if I could spend money that I don't have to make money immediately, I'll do it every single time because that's that's the way our economy is going is that's how and if I can spend your money even better by kissing the government's ass and getting them to invest subsidies into my company. Even though a company that I just took over, you know, um through a house of takeover, I didn't actually invent anything. Elon Musk, little punk ass [ __ ] Um yeah, you know, I'll take that. I I'll have to believe and and be convinced that I'm actually intelligent, you know? I don't really give a [ __ ] if I am. >> That's basically all the billionaires that we have in power right now. >> Yeah. And it's so sad to see people say, "Well, at least we're going to have cheaper oil." You know, it's like, "No, the [ __ ] you're not." >> No, we're not. >> You had cheaper oil during Iraq, you [ __ ] idiot. >> Afghanistan or uh >> after Libya >> or like, bro, that's what people don't get. I'm like, hold up. We never when when have we when have we seen gas prices go [ __ ] just tank after we conduct a major military operation for oil? >> Never. >> Never. We've seen prices drop and then they always rise back up like six months later. It's like, yeah, cuz they could have always dropped them. If they drop them immediately, it's cuz they could have always dropped them, but their intention was to always raise them again. It's like, yeah, we're going to make you think that that this this war was justified. It's like, no, I don't believe that [ __ ] If anything, what have we seen, Carlos? Every time we do go into a back and forth with the male uh major oil nation, the [ __ ] prices skyrocket. >> What happened whenever Israel attacked Iran? I heard [ __ ] was crazy at the gas station in the US, dog. >> I'm like, I thought the whole point was to make [ __ ] cheaper. >> When the proxy war against Russia started, same thing. >> Exact. Cuz what happens is they're like, I don't know what's going to happen, but I do know that this [ __ ] is going to make everything way more inconvenient. So price is going to go up because I'm predicting a loss. And if we just h if we do happen to make more money on the back end, [ __ ] that's great, too, but I'm not taking that chance because that's how economy works. >> I got to deal with my immediate look. I got to reduce and mitigate my immediate losses. I'm not about to count money that I might be getting eight, nine years from now. >> I got to pay people today. This is I think the most uh one of the most important lessons that that Marxism Leninism brings about when it comes to imperialism. Imperialism isn't just a set of policies the state does. It's part of the system. And if you recognize that the working class is structurally necessarily going to be [ __ ] over under capitalism, if you just develop that to the stage of imperialism, you think now is when they're going to start benefiting. No. The interest of working people, even in the Imperial Corps, is always going to be fundamentally the same as that of oppressed people in other countries. It doesn't matter how much [ __ ] they're fed into into their minds to make them think, "No, I'm special. I'm in the Imperial Corp. I'm going to benefit from these wars." No, the [ __ ] you're not. You're not going to benefit financially. You're not going to benefit economically. Uh you're not going to benefit politically because the police state that we're developing here is in conjunction with that. and uh your kids and your fathers and your brothers and uncles are the ones that are going to get sent over to fight and come back in black body bags with PTSD or to end up in the streets like the 700,000 homeless people that we have in this country. A lot of whom are veterans >> and a lot of whom are actually gainfully employed. >> Yeah. >> Which is another thing that nobody likes to talk about. Like California homeless people. I know a dude that was making 50 or $60,000 bro living in a tent. I [ __ ] you not. Y >> I couldn't believe it. I was like, "What?" Yeah. Because the way credit works and and California at the time wasn't allowing people to rent homes that had bankrupted even though it was California's fault that it happened. >> So, and I agree, man. Like, you're Yeah. Even if you make a shortterm even if you do benefit in the short term off of imperialism, that [ __ ] is short term. And at the end of the day, the net of the benefits will be negative. >> It will be like I've, bro, I can't tell you how many people I've seen live it up for six, seven years and then they disappear. Everybody, what the [ __ ] happened to them, man? Fell down, came down on hard times cuz all this this happened. I said this or this this these businesses that were we were contracted with all closed down and no it will all this [ __ ] is cyclical, guys. It's I mean everything everybody will come down on hard times eventually, but the majority of the hard times that happen in the US are forced upon us by the government by like a hard reset, right? Or a straight neglect. And and the problem is too that hard times are inevitable, but in countries like for example Brazil, there's a [ __ ] safety net. Like I don't got to die because I lost my job for the two for two three months cuz I lost my health care from there because they do have jobs here, business here that do provide health care if you want it because they do have private and public system. But like if I wanted to, I could just go down street two and go to the public place and it's just as good. You know, it might take about a week or two longer to do my appointment, but that's it. >> [laughter] >> The chickens always come home. >> The chickens always come home to roost sooner or later. It's like a your own life as an individual. You go around the world. When you have a little bit of power, a little bit of cash in your pocket, you treat people like [ __ ] You're an [ __ ] to people. Sooner or later, you're not going to have much in your pocket. That power is going to be gone and everyone's going to [ __ ] hate you and the chickens are going to come home to roost. But you go around like China does be nice with people. How can I help you? How can we both benefit from this trade? You think they're going to want to negotiate with you in the future? Of course, you're gonna have a lot of friends >> and they're also going to look the other way sometimes and [ __ ] like like, yeah, well, you did work with the US and they're kind of like, you know what I'm saying? Like, you are kind of the reason that they did have some of the power that they were able to get. Yeah, but hey, but look what we're doing now. You know what? You're right, man. We we ain't got everything over your head. You know what I'm saying? Like, [laughter] cuz at the end of the day, they benefited like, yeah, China did get this money, but look what they're doing with it. They're actually helping us. So it's like, you know, we'll take that trade. We don't really like because the US is going to figure out a way anyway, right? That's what they do. So it's like in their mind like, well, if China got a little bit bit was able to benefit it and it's now the success that they've gotten from that is being used to benefit all of these nations. Like [ __ ] who am I to complain? I can't judge everybody. [laughter] >> Yeah. Yeah. >> I ain't Jesus. >> They have the metaphor. They have the metaphor that they ride the tiger. They they fed the tiger as they were riding it. But at least they used it to get somewhere somewhere nice. Huh. >> I didn't know they had that metaphor. Is that real? >> Yeah, this is dope cuz it's true. >> Exactly what happened. >> But it's like at the end of the day, >> I'm sure they saw they couldn't they might maybe even couldn't believe it, right? Like y'all hold up. Y'all really going to let us make money and industrialize off of y'all money? And I know that everybody's like, "Well, they were making what I love the what I love what they do. They're like making 50 to 50 to 70 cents on a dollar." I'm like, "Hold on. Did y'all actually convert the currency? Because people don't do that [ __ ] You know what I'm saying? PEOPLE LIKE, "LOOK at how much like my like I have friends that work in Russia and they'll tell me, oh, you know, I make like 5,000 rubles a month." And I'm thinking like, "Oh, that's really good." Like, "Yeah, in Russia, but like that money anywhere else would be like $200, $300." >> Yeah. >> You know what I'm saying? And they're like, "Well, THEY THEY'RE ONLY MAKING 300. EVERYBODY'S POOR." It's like, "Did you do the [ __ ] conversion, my guy? And if you look at the cost of living there and things like that because that's kind of important. So when you're like 50 to 70 cents on a dollar in that economy in China at the time if you if you do the math that actually is really good for what you know what I'm saying for like a you know average worker things like that. But then you got safety net that they're not paying for like that uh like out of their pockets, right? And and now everybody owns homes. Damn near what it 90 90% of adults in China own homes. >> Yeah. >> Like 60% of those own two. Mhm. Yeah. >> And it's like, but they actually use them for their families and [ __ ] like that. Like imagine knowing you're going to own your home one day. Can they can can even 30% of our generation say that they are going to own a home one day with confidence? Bro, >> we'll see. >> Because I got, bro, you know, so I bought a home in Brazil thankfully. Um I was very very blessed. I bought a six a sevenbedroom nineb home, right? Um and I remember thinking before right before I left for Brazil, before I made the decision to move, damn, bro, I'm never going to go to I'm never going to own a home. It's fine. It wasn't like I wasn't making money. It just I was making money, but I'm I would look at the estimated prop property tax value over five to 10 years. Oh yeah, this [ __ ] ain't going to work. [laughter] Yeah, I'm paying this for now. I can pay off my house and then the bank can still come through and take my [ __ ] cuz this is a whole different [ __ ] mortgage except for it's permanent and it's going to keep going up. >> Mhm. >> Yeah. Okay. Yeah. I'm not Why would I buy a house then I can just rent one and not have and if I get rid of that house? Like at least it's not going to [ __ ] my whole life up. It's not going to uproot everything that my kids and my family have have built. Doesn't make any sense. And but that's where we're at, bro. Like I my property taxes in Brazil are like fixed for a certain amount of time and then there's a li when it finally does go up and it's nowhere near what I would pay in the US like is a there's a limit there's a like a legal limit that they can extend it or they can that they can arise it. So yeah, bro. It's what we're what we're seeing in the US is nuts because it's completely and totally unnecessary cuz if you see see when you see a country like Brazil, for example, fund its entire health care system and it's, you know what I'm saying? Like it's not perfect all over the country, but that's because of uh structural issues within certain states and how they spent their money thus far. So there are efforts to actually make make that better. But Brazil's healthare system is actually relatively young. their their public um their universal healthare system and they're trying to they're taking the steps in every state to try to fix the problems. But like they have other problems they have to fix too and despite all that they still >> were able to create a health care system that is pretty and their medicine is way better than ours >> with a lot of help from the Cubans. So >> yeah. Yeah. For real though honestly do have you ever heard of >> even had to call them back after he kicked them out >> for real. >> He had to call the Cubans. Yeah. at the beginning of co him out and then he brought him back. >> He's like, "Hey, man." >> He had to come back with a tail between his legs and say, you know, bring these cats back, you know. >> Yeah, bro. Because >> it it's it's so dog. I mean, everything the quality of the food and what's bad is like I will tell you, let me tell you something, Carlos. I'm gonna keep it a ban with you. I love Brazil and I feel like it's still infinitely way better than than the US. But there's a there's capitalism is winning right now >> largely because social media, right? Um and I would say the more capitalist Brazil gets and this is under Lula just to be clear everybody. Yeah, I'm saying under Lula. Um the more capitalist Brazil gets, that's where their shortcomings place. >> That's that's the reality. I I noticed it because I've seen I lived it in the US and whenever things like where you see property values skyrocket from nothing out of nowhere, people you see this predatory um landlords and things like that. I'm seeing I see Israeli construction companies [ __ ] popping up in every goddamn corner lately, dog. I because Brazil is becoming a [ __ ] world tour destination like we've never seen before. So, you know, Israel's going to show up. And so when they buy start buying up properties everywhere, what does that leave average Brazilians with? >> Yeah. >> Because they can't compete. >> So that's why I would say like the more capitalist Brazil becomes, that's where the problems start happening for the average Brazilian and the quality of life starts to get reduced. Um, whenever if Brazil leans more into communism um and socialism, then like things are way better. um even if they aren't perfect given the circumstances because you know everybody Latin America so I have to deal with the [ __ ] the boogeyman over there in the north. So I will say this before we get up out of here because of you and Eddie and definitely my man's Nick. So I'm because I'm a journalist I always feel like I have to maintain my objectivity and I can't actually advocate for any one particular ideology. Um even though I can firm and say I'm per I am 100% anti- capitalism. But boy, when I tell you boy, I had a fight with my soul because I'm like, yo, these [ __ ] be spitting this goddamn comment and [ __ ] so goddamn so real and so e I'm like this [ __ ] said, man, maybe I am, but like God, but I can't say I am because I'm a journalist and everything ELSE. BUT LIKE, GOD DAMN, IT'S [screaming] SO OBVIOUS LIKE after like when you hear spit like this when it's hard for me to TO BE LIKE DON'T SUPPORT THIS like or like don't just run. OH, MATTER OF FACT, WHY ISN'T EVERYBODY ORGANIZED OVER THIS [ __ ] RIGHT NOW? BUT >> [laughter] >> I'm not going to lie to you. It's it's uh especially when you think about everything with any type of philosophy or the context of communism and and politics over the last uh century like in these dialectical terms that y'all really do a good job of framing these conversations around like it makes it hard to not be like, "Yeah, man. Y'all should just say [ __ ] whatever everything else that y'all dealing with. That [ __ ] is really on appointment. Go organize for your favorite communist today." Uh, [laughter] but I app I appreciate the work that y'all do, man, because y'all really do a great job educating the masses. I love how you get into like the nitty-gritty of of philosophy and economics and also how to p pragmatically apply the the theories and things like that that y'all talk about uh to our everyday lives. Bro, it's it's dope. >> Thank you so much, brother. That's a honor to hear. And when you were talking a little bit earlier about the conversion uh stuff with China, the way people just convert it back to dollars and they're like, "Oh, that's nothing." It made me think of a Lenin joke that he uh brings out in leftwing communism, one of his books. He's criticizing these dogmatists that just treat Marxism as a series of stale conclusions instead of this worldview that's constantly evolving. Yeah. And uh he says these are the sorts of people that are so sure that three is more than two that you put a minus sign in front of the three and in front of the two and they still think negative -3 is more than negative -2. [laughter] >> Well that's 100% because those same people will like that is that how capitalists think. They're like they still believe in the dogmatism of capitalism which is like everything is built on competition and free market. It's like, okay, they said that one time [ __ ] 50 years ago, and y'all still believe that [ __ ] is real. Look at the new information we have pres presented to us. Cuz just like Marxism is always having to constantly fluctuate and and evolve within the context of the real world. Like capitalism has did the same thing. And they've shown us exactly what capitalism is. We don't have to guess anymore. We got a century and some change. >> Yeah. But it's free marketing. It's free market and competition. So what about the competition they killed? And what about the fact that they're literally doing everything they accuse communist of and this caricature of communism still in front of good to the rich. >> Yeah, but that doesn't really fit with my worldview and it doesn't definitely doesn't fit with my bank account. >> Um and so yeah, I have to believe that I'm going to be one of them one day. So you know it's a free market into other >> that's always so rich every I mean it's like the Zionist every accusation Zionism represents like the zenith of the spirit of capitalism and the same logic of every accusation is a projection is operative there I want to tell you a little bit before we go about my trip to China because I had a funny experience I was there uh one day the first day in Beijing just did a bunch of interviews with national media and then they told me I was going to the poorest town the poorest city in central China >> and I was like, "All right, I [ __ ] with China a lot. I've been making a ton of videos about China, showing people the big cities and stuff." >> But now they're taking me to a place and and what am I expecting? I'm expecting like dirt roads and a ton of poverty. I mean, I live we were talking a little bit uh before uh we both lived in Miami. I lived in Hyia >> uh right next to Opalaka. >> So very very poor area. Um, so I was expecting something along the lines of that level of poverty, but cynified, you know, Chinese style. >> Bro, I get to the city and see China and it's the nicest city I've ever seen in my life. There's skyscrapers all over the place. They're all like like China style sky. It's like traditional Chinese architecture with modernized buildings. They took me to the rural areas and I was like, "All right, now is when I'm going to see poverty." I'm going up these massive mountains, which are gorgeous in terms of the scenery. >> Yeah. >> All the best cars, Audi's, uh, BYDs, Mustangs >> in the Mustangs. >> Yes, bro. Like all the best American and Chinese cars in these beautiful little houses. And then I got to uh I got to the village eventually and you look at the people and the older people, you could tell there was poverty. I drank moonshine with these farmers uh that they worked together in a tea commune. They're missing their teeth cuz they got lifted out of absolute poverty just seven years prior. >> But now their kids are living in luxury, a lifestyle that I'm never >> And for them they're like the kids are like this isn't luxury. My friends down the street in other cities are [ __ ] rich rich and they're like [ __ ] driving a Mustang. LIKE WHAT YOU MEAN? [laughter] You got you driving a Mustang and I'm pretty sure that you pay extra for that [ __ ] right? Because it's China. So [laughter] yeah. >> No, it's actually cheaper. It's actually It's >> the Bro, what? >> Yeah. As a as a Mustang enthusiast, I was perplexed as well. They told me it was cheaper. >> Boy, America be lying their ass off, bro. Like almost everything when it comes to China, America be lying his ass off like, "Yeah, we not like cuz that's why China is always like kind of looking at America like, >> man, y'all go ahead. Y'all keep doing your little fake ass y'all hate China [ __ ] while we where yall literally giving us [ __ ] for cheaper because you need our market and everybody knows it, including y'all." [laughter] Like that's why I would little bro them all the time like that too. Like cuz it doesn't it look like a lot of the times that China is literally just ignoring America as they throw their temper tantrums? >> Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It's like uh the the only adult in the room. >> Yeah. It's but if that adult was like a [ __ ] billionaire basically that could spank you whenever they felt like it on top of that like he just throw like throw you out the goddamn house anytime they want it and it there even with that's one of the I would say that's probably one of the maybe flaws of China sometimes like they kind of like whenever something like this happens like with Maduro or situation with Iran they bring up more >> yeah a little bit not all the time but like just like hey man don't do that [ __ ] again are we really gonna make y'all feel it because China can make the US feel it at least economically in ways that uh other countries don't. Even Russia couldn't, right? So, I think maybe that could be it. But I do believe that there's a they are playing I believe that China does have a plan >> and >> they are playing like we're going to it's going to hit a climax and China and Russia, probably Iran too. They're going to execute some [ __ ] and the US is going to be able to react because they're going to be overextended. >> They're going to be overextended. They're going to be over they're going to be uh over everything is outmatched like as far as uh are they going to be outpriced basically because the dollar I believe is going to drop uh worldwide and um I believe there's going to be so many e uh currency treaties and and and through various mechanisms and like an attempt to uh I'll say equilibri I guess that's the word I'm looking for. I'm thinking in Portuguese so I can't remember what the word is but basically to um stabilize the country's currency differences there going to be a big treaty about that I believe it's going to be like maybe the next 10 years and the US and the because Europe I mean their second largest economy in the EU at least was France. Yeah. How's that [ __ ] looking? >> Yeah. That that whole the AES [ __ ] that whole vision up. Okay. Even Germany is kind of >> Germany. Yeah. It's destroyed after the Nordstream pipeline. >> Yep. The UK is like they're they're hanging on by a thread, but every like everybody I know from the UK like that shit's about to collapse. >> Mhm. >> So, and they all rely on the US to bail their asses out. So once they do execute this plan, which I believe is why China almost looks apathetic at times or or at least they don't care enough. Um is because they're they're biting their time like we can't do it yet. Like you got to be Chinese are about discipline >> and execution, right? And they got to they put their pride to the side. Uh and if and I wish I could be like that's not fair because like they're let but no the Chinese bro they will suffer themselves temporarily if they have to if it's the grand plan of China >> cuz it's more important >> that is more important my kids >> yeah there's the wisdom of Sunzu the art of war when your enem is making a mistake let them >> let them continue making that mistake and the way I see China remember that after the the the communist revolution was basically what made the country because it would have been just like warlordism and people say it would have been like India. No the [ __ ] it wouldn't have. It would have been three million different >> worse >> small states. >> Um >> it would have been worse >> but there was a sense of humiliation >> and it would have been way more people with the shits too like people willing to fight in China like India kind of fell into that chaos because like not everybody wanted to fight >> but it wouldn't have been able to be a common state at least India is a state. I think China would have just been uh many multiple states would have been balconized. Yeah. Balkconized. And uh you know the the thing is that before that there was a whole century of humiliation and even in the first few decades of that they were so poor and so so much struggle that even there there was a process of building up the confidence and the way I see it in terms of that point you're making when are they going to start intervening with a heavier hand you know to deal with the tempered tantrums that the the US um does. It's like um a a a kid that's been bullied, that's growing up, that's hitting the gym, and that we can all visibly see it. You you can smack the [ __ ] out the bully already, but they're almost there to get into that confidence in themselves to give them a good [ __ ] smack. And >> hopefully we we I think we're going to see it in our lifetime, probably sooner, than later. Yeah. But that's one of the reason I'm happy about living in Brazil because like Brazil's relationship with China is immaculate. >> Especially after that after that farmer uh trade situation where Trump [ __ ] themselves in the US by refusing by putting that um that embargo tariff on them. They're like [ __ ] it. We have sent $60 billion dollar in trade to Brazil. Bro, we had to build a whole ass extra port out here because of that. Bro, this is big [clears throat] 60 billion USD. So imagine how much that is in Halo. Like it's it's crazy >> seeing the US just screw themselves over and over and over again. And it's almost like Trump I don't think that that anyone has actually sat Trump down and talked to him like hey you do know this whole anti-China [ __ ] is supposed to be an act right [laughter] like right like no nobody sat him down and had that conversation that it's just like it's just a little thing that we do in public cuz we had to pretend like we care about the fact that they got the better of us in that in that ma deal like you know that's it's an act right we do need them like they are a third of our economy No, no. We are the US. They need us. No. They We owe all the money to them. We owe all the money. Y They can call our [ __ ] right now. If they call If they pull our [ __ ] right now, we going broke. Like that's because that's what it is. So, I will say though it they do have to I agree with Nick to too to some degree that like I don't like that there's a dis disproportionate amount of of pressure put on China and Russia to resolve problems from the US when the people in the US aren't doing anything like oh man why don't Russia and China like no why don't you [ __ ] get out there and do your part to make sure that your country doesn't do this [ __ ] anymore >> because we're all fat and on Walmart scooters [snorts] getting in line to [ __ ] Cinnabon or something like that >> entire exhausted like but I eventually you do hit a point of exhausted of exhaustion you you're like [ __ ] this like what have I got to lose at this point and the Americans are getting there >> but like it is if like when it comes to Gaza which I did see people take start taking [ __ ] through their hands a little bit more with Gaza right that was like one of the first time we've seen it in our generation >> um [clears throat] with Venezuela um it hadn't happened people were doing it again oh well China and Russia should >> No China Russ going to do what's best for their interest because they have to play a long game but you don't have to for their for by the way for their people in countries that are [ __ ] massive, >> right? Little pe a little bit of people in these nations and China. I will say too just really quick before we go that that what you me mentioned about China and like the hundred years of embarrassment that they had to deal with and then having to bounce back. What's important is like now this thing that is seen as such an asset for them which is their population size. >> Back then that [ __ ] was a problem >> cuz how can we organize with no technology? We have like you know you got emperors and [ __ ] and d like but the reality is like them emperors knew like at any day like I don't know what the [ __ ] going on over there across China and if I'm in Eastern China like I don't know what's going like I can somebody can tell me what's happening but like there was a reason it was always switching dynasties. That's not normal unless you got billions of people or at that time hundreds of millions of people to to govern in a country that's massive. >> Yeah. And everybody like, well, how could they not have, bro? They should have been able to fight. And no, every because it wasn't like they had a Beijing like with a city with hundreds of millions of people and then everybody else on the outskirts. Everything was spread out. It was easy to catch people slipping. It was harder to organize. But then they that thing that everybody would have considered to be a plus back then is a plus now. >> But it was a negative at that point. I feel like that doesn't really get discussed enough. And even I would say that the US can can they know how having a population size that big and that diverse can be a negative because they use it against Russia and the Soviet Union. >> Yeah. To try to balconize. Yeah. >> Exactly. So yeah, but appreciate you having me on, bro. >> No, man. It's been a pleasure. We're going to have to have you back sometime soon. >> For sure, bro. For sure. >> We're gonna we're going to put all of your social media uh links and stuff in the description for people to check out your work, but is there anything you'd like to plug before we head out? >> Oh, no. Just follow us on Hotspot. Um, it's hotspot hotspot on on X. And you can follow me on Twitter, uh, on Instagram, real Nico House. That's Nico with a K. And then on YouTube, for the people podcast. >> Sounds good. All right, brother. See you. Have a good rest of your day. >> Appreciate you, bro.
