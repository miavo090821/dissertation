is a lot of you know black creators and black people in general have had to deal with the environment that you know me and you know other creators have have made because if we had the ability if we had if we had the ability to cancel you you wouldn't have been successful in the first place and I totally get Francesca's feelings of like you can't like undo five ten years of harassment that I've received like not being a racist not being a bigot is the bare minimum we're not giving out cookies for that foreign I want to preface this video with a disclaimer if you are somebody who innately finds the mention of race or racism agitating turn this video off and go where the love is because you are not gonna find it here babes and we are being productive today this is not a drama video it's not a video about canceling anyone it's not even a video about railing against white content creators who create platforms doing bigoted content and apologize and or pivot it's about trying to get to the root of how these platforms come to exist in the first place why they seem to persist in spite of the communities that they harm actively telling those creators that it causes harm and what if any material things those creators can do to mitigate the harm they've caused and or at least demonstrate their sincerity so we as an audience can better determine who is being genuine and who's just trying to make some kind of leftist Rebrand because the reality is this exists this happens so what do we do going forward this is not a video about condemnation it is about problem solving and it's about recognizing very real realities very different kinds of harms and different perspectives and opinions people are entitled to have around harm that is caused I interviewed idubbz or Ian I was being very just generally uncaring but before I show you that interview I need to First give you a little back story and explain to you why I interviewed him so you have the proper context to view it in because again this is not about him as an individual he is a case study which is why I first interviewed Francesca Ramsey an amazing writer comedian actress and also somebody that idubbbz had personally attacked and caused a harassment campaign to wage against her for years I started thinking about this because I co-host a show called the leftist mafia and a couple of months ago we had to remove one of our co-hosts Illuminati when substantial evidence was brought to the table to show that she had a history of attacking and harassing every creator that seemed to cross her path but more than that we learned that she had done what I like to call the leftist Rebrand it's when white content creators build platforms on what they call edgy but bigoted content and then after years of causing harm and attacking absolutely anybody who criticized them for it they simply apologize to their audiences who not only never cared that they did it loved them precisely because they did it and that audience of course forgives them because it was never their harm to forgive and they go on business as usual the problem with these Redemption arcs or rebrands however you choose to characterize it is that one you never really know who's being sincere versus just making some kind of pivot for their own Financial or professional gain two they are rarely any concrete acts of atonement made to or for the individuals or communities that were actually harmed and they're usually left entirely out of the conversation three while it does theoretically make sense to want to forgive people for doing something wrong and then recognizing that and wanting to do better little exploration is had into whether or not giving out that forgiveness so freely incentivizes other white creators to build their platforms this way knowing they will be excused in the future and four little exploration has had into why those creators didn't seem to realize their behavior was apology Worthy when the communities they were harming were actively telling them it was as Francesca put it they will make you a Target and they will make you their jumping off point and they will use bigotry as a come up and what's I mean I don't want to be right it's bittersweet yeah but as I'm seeing it happen I'm like I said this would happen if years ago years not a month ago not a week ago years check the receipts I said this would happen and it absolutely did so while I've been thinking about all that I came across this tweet by Francesca I didn't intend on making a video about this but I'm so angry that like I just have to say something and just like get it out and let it go um so recently there's been a wave of people who've made bigoted content on the internet coming forward and apologizing Tick Tock we've got Kelly cagden on YouTube we have I dubs I think is how you say his name um and in years past we've had Shane Dawson and all of these people I have different relationships with so I hosted a show for MTV called MTV decoded I actually created the show I wrote on the show I hired tons of incredible people and made a lot of great content that I am very proud of but at the time that the show was on I dealt with a lot of harassment because of it from these people that labeled themselves anti-social Justice Warriors anti-feminist on YouTube including idubbbz and he made a number of videos where he used the n-word fully uncensored where he put my face in videos and called me a you know and you know said that my work was cancer and like his my work made him want to kill himself most of these videos have been privated so I can't show them to you but I've seen them and he created a culture and a fan base that then harassed me so did Shane Dawson and the caption on the video read a response regarding creators who Rebrand or outright denounced their past racist or bigoted content via apology video the culture of harassment and bigotry you've created and profited off is not a race with a story or a Rebrand when I looked at the people that she had tagged I realized that items and I followed each other because I attended create a clash earlier this year with my friend LOL overruled so I went down the rabbit hole starting with the apology which listen as far as these apology videos go it was a better one he was so flagrant and I will say like I'm not one to give out cookies I watched his whole apology video and I will say like in the grand scheme of responses it's the better he did a better job than most so I'm gonna say that he probably had someone advising him which I don't think is a bad thing it's it's probably a smart thing to do but again it just it's just it's just not enough for me it's not enough for me and I I hope that he's genuinely committed to being a better person and again like I listened to it and maybe he is but like notably though in his apology he singled out only one Creator at first The Only Name he singles out to apologize doing this is a white woman Francesca okay we're right here we are right I mean you know I got clocked out immediately I didn't know who she was so I assumed she was a black woman right based on the contacts in the video I know but did you and did you go down the rabbit hole of I sure did the situation started I mean the iron the levels of irony you apologizing to a white girl for using the n-word who always who used to and herself also yeah I'm wearing and you thought and you thought that you were gonna check her on using the n-word but come on we had an Inception territory but I do think it's a conversation that needs to be had with the centering of of whiteness even within your even within your recognition of wrongness or apology of going forward there's still not only is there a centering of of white women and and even the apology of the aftermath but it's even the center of what I believe drove the desire to go this path because I think it's his audience what happened is the audience they were attacking his his wife and that is the T and that is that's when he that's when it got real and that and that's what I'm like so it got real for you when a white woman was hurt and in the apology it's only a white woman who is singled out and apologized to because I'm like well you're apologizing for making racist and bigoted content and yet no black person has been individually named right there like I don't need him to check me by name I would prefer I would prefer my name but at the same time I did similarly you to you [ __ ] the irony of him devoting a substantial part of that video directly to Tana yes and and even she's another example of someone who has rebranded right like she was saying the n-word she was making this like bigoted content and then she really kind of moved in a different direction and that was what he called out supposedly that led down that path so again it's it is it rings Hollow for me especially because I've been on the internet a very long time and I've watched this happen numerous times and I've seen people come and go and the people who are able to remain relevant and the ones who are able to continue to have a platform evolve and sometimes it is uh authentically so and other times it's like oh my God I gotta move I gotta change [ __ ] up because yeah they about to cancel me I'm about to get out of here and it's like I have to set the stage for this kind of video because when you talk about racism there are people who just feel personally attacked they automatically feel like you're making a personal indictment of them and from that moment forward they are in defense mode and you are their adversary because what they're really hearing is you think I'm a bad person you think I consciously decided to be racist but the reality is a lot more nuanced and a lot less personal than that the reality is that if you recognize that racism is pervasive in a society that there is systemic racism that we are all being raised and educated and indoctrinated in a society as well racism and anti-blackness into our laws into our media into our schools into our every fabric of our institutions you will internalize and perpetuate racism and anti-blackness whether you're aware whether you consciously set out to be or identify as a racist whether you're a good person to the people in your life whether you think you mean well or not unless you make the conscious decision to recognize and unlearn these things and do better going forward although it is often received as such it is not an innately personal indictment if you are a white person being told that something you do or say is racist the problem is doubling tripling and quadrupling down taking an utter refusal to hear or consider what entire communities are actively telling you and it's often worse than just ignoring or refusing to hear those communities that these creators are causing harm to often their audiences will attack those communities but you know again like not to give him cookies because it's the bare minimum but it is very telling that he admitted that this was coming from a place of insecurity I am very insecure about my ability to create interesting content or like entertain and it's one of the reasons why I you know kept making this hurtful content I don't want you to interpret that as an excuse but I hope that that is relatable to other creators who maybe struggle with the same thing uh I'm not confident in my ability to entertain and I think if I had to rely on my personality uh to entertain people that I I wouldn't I wouldn't have any amount of success yeah because that was the thing that I picked up on too where it's like it's really easy to and I'm guilty of this too like I don't participate in you know I used to like hate Tweet stuff I'd be like I hate this show so let me sit here and talk about it and it's like you know what even if I don't like the content they did the work and they put it out in the world instead of me doing the same thing I'm sitting here hating on them and [ __ ] on them when I could be putting this energy into making the thing that I'm actually interested and passionate about and that's what a lot of these creators that build platforms off of Just hating on things it's like it's become it's because you can't create anything from scratch you know you have to really put yourself out there to have an original idea and put the time and energy into crafting it and building an audience it's really easy to piggyback on somebody else's work and then just say well this this sucks it's like yeah okay you right you literally have not made anything and so again it's truly the bare minimum but him acknowledging that that was coming from a place of like am I actually even funny yeah I believe that I believe that you didn't know if you were funny without talking [ __ ] about other people's work I I believe that I 190 believe that and I think that's actually when I peel it back that's actually what was a bigger problem for me when I realized it because I'm like me in me recognizing that in the same way that you recognize that both of us were inclined to give empathy and both of us were like you know I understand the impulse to do this I understand the impulse of [ __ ] on these things they understand that but you know what makes you feel I think two things one is black people we're always being asked of an expected and held in the place to always have to be compassionate and empathetic to people who are mistreating as one but two it's because we as creators can appreciate what okay someone else has created and what goes into that and that makes you have a different kind of respect for that so it's two levels we respect that on a human level we empathize because we're humans and we empathize as creators and on no level did he empathize on none of those levels to be empathized with any of these people so much so that even in this apology none of them get singled where was the Jinx where was the where were these people where was any where was any Jinx that was the beginning of the end for jinx's platform and he's no longer on YouTube and then I thought about that that's also a part of it the reason why you single out the white content creator on in addition to it being okay because she's still here because she's now and guess what she was like come on my podcast let's talk they're just gonna use this to then platform each other and exactly to like raise their own profile which is why I'm like none of this holds water to me for me because you know again like bars in hell but the only person that I've really seen take any real measurable responsibility is Jenna Marbles she said I'm out she said I've built a platform I've done some things that I'm not proud of and I think her motivations were twofold I think she was burnt out on creating content to begin with I think that that was just you know the timing was right but she said I'm not going to do this anymore and and again like I don't I don't think she needs me to accept her apology or or anything but at the same time I'm like you know you're backing up what you're saying yeah I've profited off of this I don't feel good about it so I'm gonna bow out and to me it just feels like damage control to make the apology and then just move because even he said at one point he was like I'm not going to just keep apologizing I'm not going to keep making content about this and I was like yeah exactly this is you going I'm done with this and I never have to think about it again after this when the reality is you've made Millions off of this content so like and I think that is actually you know a place and something that I actually want to discuss and I will discuss with him because you know normally when you have conversations about like reparations just as a larger conversation in our society that becomes a harder more nuanced conversation because people say then yeah this is very we know who we have we can see we know who we know when and I I'm like well you know what I think and I'm gonna talk to him about this I think you know what is a meaningful step because I know he said in the video I'm running I am running ads on this video and I'm gonna donate to a foundation or something the black people you've harmed of course there are far more black people that have been harmed than just the individual content creators and that you will have to atone for in some other way and you probably will not be able to right that's just what that is because you put that out into the world and you can't take that back one two faster hate and white supremacy it is what it is but as far as the individual creators oh you know who you you know who they are you go look at the privated videos on the videos every every video you did every content cop on a jinx which you did to you which you did to all them and what was the revenue on those videos and pay and cut some checks and and again he did acknowledge that he has built a career a successful career because he's gone on to do other things outside of YouTube I think he's doing this like boxing series or something like that and I'm sure he's making tons of money for that from that yeah he got that platform off of those videos they didn't just get the opportunity to sell tickets and do you know these big events just because he's a he's a great fighter no he got to do that because he built a ginormous audience on YouTube right and I don't know who his wife is I don't I don't watch her content but his success has also given her an ability to have a platform right yeah there's like a trickle down to your point about reparations we can see that the content that he created has opened doors for him Beyond YouTube so again personally I don't I don't need a check from him I'm good and I love that for you but I love that for me too honestly I really do but at the same time it's like an apology is is not enough for me yeah and and I don't think there's anything that he can do that will ever be enough yeah and I think that him and any of these other creators who Rebrand if you genuinely are looking to better yourself you have to acknowledge and accept that it won't be enough for some people yeah and I'm okay with that I don't think about you I don't lose sleep over you you should be moving forward in a way that's repairing harm and being better in every day of your life yeah because that's the bare minimum yeah like not being a racist not being a bigot is the bear minimum we're not giving out cookies for that thank you so much I am surprised that you agreed to do it but very delighted yeah I mean I'm trying to uh expand my horizons a little bit I you know 2016 me you know probably wouldn't it wasn't I'm surprised 2023 you were doing it either oh hell yeah I appreciate that I I take that as a compliment yeah listen I I honestly want to start off by saying that I ship of it all I respect that you were even coming over to my side of uh the internet to come talk about it because I am very much of a racial investigator and and people find me to be an intimidating character so I'm like and I tried to be really transparent because I don't like to ambush people or anything like that I it's not my STEEZ I don't enjoy it I don't like stressful content of stressing people out so that's why I'm like let me go into it and be as transparent as possible let's be as I want to be as nice as possible without being accused of being too nice while also being as transparent about what are some of my takeaways and thoughts and also giving you the opportunity to expound expand and let's try work to a good place yeah you have a very tough job I don't uh I know what you mean it's you gotta walk a line you get it you get it exactly because so basically let me tell you the starting how we ended up here um so you know I went to create a clash with my my boy Alex um and funny enough he actually had tried to fill me in on the controversy but I never care about it anything so this is this is how the conversation went he invited me to come to Creator Clash he called me to be like hey just so you know like you know there is a little bit of uh you know controversy you know he's got some edgy like content in the past and I said is edgy white people speak for racist and he said yes and I said okay and I said all right and that was all my you know because listen I'm of the mindset we live in America we live in a racist Society we live in these kinds of things I am not putting it on you as an individual or anything like that and I don't really want to take an individualistic approach to trying to nail you to the cross I more so just want to see different things and I think patterns that we can unpack and maybe it can make it better for some people to understand what are issues black people have with certain content or going forward and these kinds of things right so that's kind of where I'm coming from so I saw the apology watched the whole video and I texted both Alex and my editor and I said the best of them I've seen of as far as apology videos and seeing content creators throughout the years and actors famous people public figures make apologies I thought it was the most accountable I've ever seen it be so I want to give you all the credit for that that's great to hear it's I mean for me it's been uh a huge relief um because I think for me it's like you know even even though I was taking a stance on you know using slurs and you know being very like uh just not wanting to be responsible for how other people felt um me existing in the world and you know trying to you know live uh outside of my bedroom at home yeah uh I found it to be very challenging to interact with people without feeling some amount of guilt of like have you seen my videos you know how would you interpret what I've said yeah and you know how uncomfortable have I made you and it you know it interaction after interaction it kind of added up to me saying like yeah something needs to be said yeah at least and and I feel that and I understand that and I very much so I'm glad that you at least even even came to that spot because that's more than most ever do but what I guess I wonder is why not then because the train I've realized very often I see this in the space a lot is a tendency for you know white content creators to be called out for things present day that were racist and bigoted then but there were always black people and people present in marginalized people telling them that then why not hear it when they say it um I think generally uh I think for me it was I think uh sort of a policy or like a just very black and white thinking like as soon as I for because for me I think it's it's about caring about how other people are feeling period um not necessarily just marginalized people I think I I personally had an issue with like uh caring about people's feelings at all because I felt like as soon as I would uh open that door then like I felt like I would be a lot less safe to you know do and say whatever I I wanted and now now that's kind of like an in I I guess for people to criticize or in for you know people to you know because I'm essentially exposing myself as like oh I'm now thinking about how other people are feeling you know and but I guess to your point um I don't have uh any black friends uh I have some friends who are people of color but you know it's never I grew up in Southern California yeah and uh I I'm certain if if I grew up around more black people I wouldn't have felt nearly as comfortable saying the things that I was saying yeah and uh yeah I think the more interactions that I've had with black content creators um and just you know uh regular Everyday People The more I've realized like this matters yeah so you know and I and I don't say this is an indictment I say this as a transparent thing that we would all realize and I appreciate your answer because I think your answer allows me to like more clearly parse that out is it didn't care and I don't mean that in a you know didn't care these are not people that you and I was something I think kind of struck me right because it in watching your video a thing I wanted to ask you about was how come Tana of all the you only singled out one person to apologize to why her uh I think because I kind of just take it took it to like another level um because I think a lot of uh commentary channels they can feel very comfortable and justified in speaking about a variety of topics because they're not they're not like in person harassing people and uh they're a lot of them are avoiding saying like the slurs like I was saying they're keeping it to like a certain level where they look around their community and they're saying like well I'm not doing anything like that polarizing I'm kind of keeping I'm riding the line a little bit more and uh I think for Tana specifically she was I think the youngest person I've made a video about um and I don't know it was just uh that she was I guess she was also in I think the worst part about it is going to her Meetup because she was in what would feel like a you know a safe space she's already putting herself out there at a meet and greet I wouldn't even do meet and greets you know she was doing a meet and greet and I you know I scared I jump scared her and you know who knows what my intentions were she had no idea no one there knew what my intentions were and that's a scary situation to be in that's horrible yeah no that's absolutely validate right there is a there is a fair situation to that and that makes me think of so Francesca Ramsey um who I have spoken with she tells us a story about being terrified in the airport when she runs into one of your fans when I encountered one of his fans in the airport I had to ask myself am I going to exit this com this conversation and continue to have my life you know what I mean like yeah like my life could be in danger right like and so uh you know again that's why when there's there's all of these conversations about don't call me a Karen and don't call me white and don't call me racist it's like when those names are used your feelings are hurt but when someone calls me the n-word I have to wonder is this person going to try and kill me is my am I going to lose my life right now who tells who comes up there and says I watch and I know you from items videos and the fair she felt and not knowing what this person is for her and I think why I asked a ton of question is this and I think you're right to apologize to Don I don't think you're wrong to to apologize to Donna I think what I really want to unpack is the decision to apologize her exclusively because if you watch that video with someone like me who didn't want your content and who isn't Familiar of the larger array you would think that this is the only person you know or maybe the way I read it was okay he's been in trouble for using this kind of language and racial slurs and all this but the only person he individualizes is a white woman and he talks about he says you know he apologizes maybe to the black community in large and it would lead you to believe that no black person was individually picked on or targeted and that's not the case and I think what I find interesting is that even in apologizing for doing racist things a white woman is always apologized to as though there weren't black people who were called the n-word and I wonder because that took me down a rabbit hole of watching you know videos and I saw a Content cop you did on jinx on camera you don't get a break in the beginning no resting 100 24 7 grind damn this nigga's on the grind that shirt shouldn't say it's about that time it should say it's about that grind four videos a day non-stop editing I'm like an animator I put so much work in my videos I'm like sitting there keyframe after keyframe trying to figure out how to put this [ __ ] video on the corner of my screen grind mad grind 24 hours a day seven days a week nothing but grind I'm on the grind my house this ain't a normal house it's a grand house you gotta ain't sleeping [ __ ] YouTube you gotta suck dick and [ __ ] YouTube oh it's so motivational holy [ __ ] oh I'm gonna do it I'm gonna do it right now I'm gonna sit on my bed I'm gonna sit on the end of my bed I'm gonna set up the camera and I'm gonna watch some [ __ ] videos [ __ ] editing [ __ ] that [ __ ] what am I a [ __ ] dude are you gonna edit your video no what do I look [ __ ] gay and I wonder why a jinx wouldn't receive an apology someone or what because I think what and I credit you for this in your apology I actually did really like this the part where you acknowledge I didn't feel comfortable in my own ability to be funny or my own ability and my own personality or whatever it is and so I leaned on this and I get that and I because on some level on a human level I understand things but on a content creator on a public figure level of making things I can I understand what it is to have insecurities and I I respect I think it's big to admit that but on the other level I think to myself well did you know that then right are you aware now of this insecurity or did you know it then and if so why is the same not Grace shown to a person like Jinx when you decide to make a contact cop about them and you know basically what you're honing in on is saying is they're on talented or there isn't work that goes into their videos right why isn't it sufficient enough to have your platform right you already have your platform that is in some way being boosted and made on this kind of bigoted content that's one thing to exist in that space But to not allow this other black Creator to exist and in the same way you call these black people you call black people themselves the n-word but they aren't singled out in the apology and I wonder why it is that that's the case love it they can't stand to see us and this is not just exclusive to black people this is marginalized people period this is what you're seeing happening during Pride right this idea that if I think you are less than me how dare you like yourself how dare you be happy how dare you be successful when through throughout history I've been told that my whiteness and and me doing the bare minimum is the standard yes and now y'all taking my jobs you taking my views you you out yeah taking my partners like you are you are living the life that I'm supposed to have yes and I'm just minding my business um uh well I think Jinx specifically um I think all of these creators to you know varying degrees that I've made content cop videos on I think they deserve you know their own apology in their own way I think Jinx is definitely one of them I think the type of content he was uh making you know in the same way that I felt um it I guess it wasn't necessarily that you know Jinx making reaction content like you know nowadays that's like it's it's commonplace right so you don't know if he in a lot of ways um initiated that Trend and I think uh you know the content I was making it was just um it was cheap I think in in kind of the same way that some people can view reaction content as cheap so I think in a lot of ways I am guilty of what I was criticizing Jinx for I was being very just generally uncaring um and yeah like I said I was insecure about my ability to entertain and yeah I think you know Jinx deserves his own apology and I'm I'm open to uh you know uh personally talking to jinx or you know whatever he might be open to yeah I mean because listen I think something I don't think I don't think it said that there's an aversion to to uh forgiving you right like if we think of if I think of myself as a proxy representative for the black community right now I don't think it's that um anybody has the aversion of it giving you I think it's the recognition that it doesn't matter whether we do or don't because if we had the ability if we had the ability to cancel you you wouldn't have been successful in the first place because black people have a problem with you now had a problem with you then they were just being ignored and so similarly what I think is the thing that I really want to unpack is this is that you're allowed to apologize whether or not you don't or you do come forward and I appreciate the way the approach that you've taken and that you've chosen to on your own without a larger controversy be forced to but the thing is what I noticed when I went down the Deep dive is most of the black people that you did single out are no longer making YouTube videos they're they're no longer content creating in one way or the next they've in some way been run off the platform I've been terrified through years of harassment Francesca was harassed so much that it's a part of her Wikipedia page is that that she's went through a series of harassment and I think that's what's notable to me because I watched Tana's response to your apology and she talks about how she she also respected it and how she would be open to a world where she talked to you and how she herself has been canceled and her different pivots and I think that is the thing that really is the ire of the community and seeing that is that you have the ability to make a platform on bigoted content attack a black black content creators doing similar things or you know and you know basically Target them as not not talented or not this or whatever it is and essentially run them off the platform but white content creators even the ones guilty of doing those things are able to Pivot and I think that's the thing that worries people in like something I've been mulling over and how to go about this because sometimes you worry that well if I say it's okay or if you forgive people then it incentivizes other people to do the same like what is to say there aren't going to be because there is it happens all the time of people saying I I want to do something and I don't think I have the talent to do it I don't think I have this so let me make my platform on punching down and I will be able to at a later date say sorry and move on I think that's an extremely valid fear and I think that's kind of what from what I heard from Francesca that would be that's really frustrating and I don't think it's fair I think you know the like it's it's good for people to change obviously um I think the level that like the I would say the the response that I've gotten anywhere from you know one end of the spectrum where like commentary channels are saying like I don't think he has any reason to apologize to like maybe Francesca Ramsey at the other end saying like this isn't like even close to being uh enough yeah uh because a lot of you know black creators and black people in general have had to deal with the environment that you know me and you know other uh creators have have made and so like I think that entire range of reaction is uh appropriate yeah um and so I mean for me it's sort of expected right because I think a lot of the people who say that I shouldn't have apologized or something like that they are so far from like arriving to where I've I'm at yeah and I totally get Francesca's feelings of like you can't like undo five ten years of harassment that I've received like um so I get it um I wish uh I mean all I can think of you know at this point is to communicate um my headspace and like where I was at at the time and how I came to uh uh terms with like understanding like my role and responsibility in our community um and just like communicate to that that to people because that's like that's as close as I can get to like undoing things or like fixing things yeah and and how did you like when you made the final decision that you were gonna make the video like this is it like what was the what happened there uh I think there's been a lot of things I think um number one I think like doing this whole Creator Clash thing has has opened my eyes to it in a big way um I think I've had to uh interact with you know boxing is a very is a is a community that has a lot of marginalized people in it you know there are a lot of black people in boxing um Mexicans I mean it is super popular uh around the world and my dad loves boxing yeah yeah I mean it's so I I've had to you know interact with uh different people than the usual like you know small bubble of like commentary YouTubers on YouTube like that's very small they're coming from like the same world that I come from and uh it just makes my um confidence and a lot of these like uh ideas that I've developed over the years be like less and less confident in them because it's like oh holy [ __ ] like this is these are real people and they're they're as [ __ ] you know yeah uh compassionate and you know I don't know it's just I get it I mean I understand I went to I went to boarding school and watched Virginia so and I was the only black girl in my senior class so I have been um people's first many many white person's first introduction to a black person that in any way departed from a caricature or a stereotype they had in their mind um and I think you know listen I I actually think you're in a better position than most if you think about it because you're not you're not the only white person there are there are tons of white people even the ones I'm sure condemning you guilty of similar Behavior at the very least being complicit on the spectrum of racism so you're not alone you're in you're in a company a country full of company right um so that's not yeah um so in that respect very often I think you know when we talk about racism all kind of white people if they were able to if they had a if there were video logs of their platform or how they've lived their life I'm sure they have a community of black people who would be upset or who they've wronged or they've fostered attitudes and things too but they don't have the benefit I think in your case you actually do have the benefit of knowing who and what like you don't have the you can't contain once you spread like toxicity you can't spread with your audience does you can only try to course correct and I respect that you are doing that right so you can't do anything about whatever black people were on the receiving end of who your audience members or those things but you do know which individual black people you know that you make content talks about or that you singled out and or you know and you know what those videos made in Revenue you have the ability to look at these things and I think you do have a way to definitively concretely do some things and and especially um when we tie it back to you earlier saying you have no black friends and listen even if you didn't tell me that I knew that I went to create a clash yeah change that you know what I mean if you're a person if you have you have the benefit uh whether we like it or not I can't crush your platform nobody else can either you're gonna have one you're gonna still have this audience so if you have the benefits your white privileges that you ability you have the ability to maintain your platform and continue to grow I think a way that you step forward or where you atone that is to change the lack of the way they're black people's platforms that you brought down bring some black people's platforms up you know what I mean I will consider your presence here you taking a step in to getting on the black side of the internet but I do think um that is a way you can concretely do something like take a look at the private videos or whatever videos it is where you targeted whatever content creators and look and see how much did that make or what was this and like sit down and try to like piece by piece what can we do about this how can we reach out to these folk and I think that can make them that shows some kind of material step you know like you know what I bro I acknowledging that it's not just that you built your platform off of you know some bigoted content because that's not innately the problem it's that you also destroyed black platforms and so I think that's where a good place for you to kind of move forward and that was an idea I wanted to bring to you yeah I I appreciate that I I think I think that's a good idea and uh yeah I'm gonna I'm going to take your advice on that I think um I was uh going to go on uh Tana's podcast yeah um what what is your I guess uh I'm curious what your thoughts on doing that would be um I think you can do that I don't think that there is a problem with you doing that especially if that's somebody um you you you singled out and you did do something there and I unless like I said I don't think you're wrong to apologize to or acknowledge a dangerous element or that I don't think that will that will warm the hearts of the communities in particular marginalized communities they feel impacted by because I think they're still going to feel like the narrative will still be that a white woman was centered in all of this and that ultimately you're apologizing for saying a racial slur black racial slur to a white lady um so I don't think but I don't think you're wrong to do it I think you can do multiple things in the same way that you could sit down and talk to me I think you can sit down and talk to Donna so I think that's fine I don't think you have to take that out of your Lexicon but I think the same way you've made these are bold steps like I said I I want to give credit to that most people are not sitting down with me okay people are scared of me on a regular even in court okay so um I think it's just about you saying now hey maybe let me see how I reach out to a jinx at the very least even if you because a lot of these people may not be receptive to talking to you I know Francesca don't care to speak to you anything like that but I think there's a way that you can change a narrative like what I saw a lot when I was watching there was a video that's why I figured I watched a whole video on the the end of jinx's career right and that begins with content cat cop is the beginning of the end for Jinx and even because of the audience the we know this being on Twitter the popular opinion is who's got the biggest audience right or who's the winner who's still standing and so because there's you're the one that's still standing and Jinx has been run off the platform the audience's perspective is like he was he was stupid he was prideful he should uh I'm like yeah he's calling him every kind of N word and you're mad at the man because he's upset I think you can there's a way to we can speak up for people that you could say hey you know what I actually was wrong you know what I mean or that wasn't you know that's not the right perspective to have a night because so much public perception changes where where whether or not we're able to succeed and changing the public perception on jinxes would kill them so I think there's also a way that you can just kind of just kind of walk back some of these things and maybe recognize the humanity that you didn't recognize in them then recognize it now because think about think about if you felt the way you felt and all the things that you're going through but you also your platform was gone yeah so I think that's a way I think absolutely um well I I mean I don't know to the extent uh like how much of this footage you plan on uh using for your video but yeah I I did find out uh a couple months ago that Jinx has me blocked on Twitter so if Jinx does come across this video uh I'll I'll you know see if there's an email or something but let it be known I'm I'm down uh to uh you know speak with you and even do it all publicly or you know whatever he'd like and I love that listen I love that the defense attorney in my heart I when I when I stumbled on the Jinx thing I was like listen I don't I'm still I'm years behind I didn't know nothing about Jinx in 2015 of all of this but I was like he does not know it wherever he is in the world but Justice for Jake um so I'm glad and I'm really again I'm really glad that you sat down with me is there anything in particular I want to make sure that you're able to like say whatever you say because this I think this is the closest you're gonna get to talking directly to cornbread too so um you don't know cornbread too have you never heard that no I haven't I was like what is that oh Brad so bradtube is the video essay of space right the general video essays and Cornbread it's the black video essay okay okay yeah yeah I've heard of Redtube cornbread too that's funny I like it you'll get it uh so if there's anything you wanted to say to them directly please this is your moment oh I mean maybe I'd have more to say if I if I was like familiar but is there is there like more is there any like I guess I'll just say like out of the you know the the I've watched I mean I tend to want to stay away from a lot of the reaction videos to like my apology and stuff mentally It's just tough to deal with yeah um but there have been a few that I've I've watched uh fully and Cat black is is one of the videos that I watched and um I mean I would say out of any of the uh um reactions to watch in my opinion uh it would be cat Black's response because she definitely comes from you know obviously a perspective of uh um you know being someone this apology might be appropriate for and she essentially says like hey I'm probably not gonna watch uh I'm not like an items fan or anything I'm probably not going to watch any of his videos going forward but I at least feel a little bit more safe if he's like at a convention or he passed by each other or whatever like I don't I'm not gonna immediately dismiss him as like that the racist guy or whatever and yeah that's to be honest like all I'm uh you know all I could ask for in that case good well I listen I I appreciate that you I really appreciate that you sat down I appreciate the willingness to to own it because like I said it's just true it's not and it's not just true about you like I have my own white friends we know we can call them I'd be like oh Mark that was racist he'd be like oh my fault oh my God uh and you know you course correct the only way that you can fix a problem is if you acknowledge it it exists we all have um biases and prejudices and I can't rake you over to Kohl's for you know what's been done but I can only what I wanted to do was maybe explain to you give you I was like you know what if I have the I seem to have a path or an ability to talk to him let me give you some of my thoughts and maybe that helps you better understand where the community comes from and maybe other people listening to it and watching it that are open to that can get it too and we can maybe do something better about how we deal with these these pivots these apologies yeah I yeah no I super appreciate it I think the the you bringing up uh Jinx and you know other black craters that have been affected I think is a very appropriate and I think you're right I think um like he was I think the first person I did a Content cop video on and um you know it's been a long time since then and you know you're right like a lot of these you know I'm thinking about like keemstar and yeah I mean even rice gum like all these guys have like you know Ben kind of continued to like push on because they are I don't know they're like like cockroaches of YouTube they just continue to like make content whether it be drama or anything else so um uh yeah I think it's it's it's easy to forget those who disappear off the internet and you know generally uh neglected uh so I appreciate that and also if you um if you ever need to uh get a white guy's perspective on who who is is definitely like been there yeah you know I'm always available thank you so much Ian I'm glad this went well I was very I believe it or not I was a little bit nervous yeah yeah I mean I'm I'm trying I was nervous too but yeah [Music] Raheem hasn't made an appearance in a while I thought y'all needed some wholesome content for all this stressful stressful or heavy stuff hi Amy say hi to the Illuminati this is my son first of his name oh
