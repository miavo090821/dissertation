vice versa women's rights or vice suffering from women's rights as you might be able to say because uh there's a vice reporter who's been sat in afghanistan taliban afghanistan making a film and uh on that note just as a side note i mean glory to her on that that's fair play that takes balls that's good journalism except she then gave an interview or at least did an interview with one of the ladies of the taliban and uh it is it is the most like dunce interview you've ever seen so i thought we'd have some fun looking at it because they're the taliban what are you expecting what do you think their views on women's rights are they're going to be very islamic aren't they they're going to be accordance with the sharia the islamic law she didn't think so presumably otherwise i don't know why you ask these questions big shock let's get this up so this is this is the interview and people can go watch the full thing and have some enjoyment of their own in the meantime but if we go to the uh next link real quick first uh you you can uh have a quick old look at the response from mr taliban himself dealing with this damn western women you know it's going to be good it's uh let's let's play the first clip i mean a lot of the funds coming into this country have been paused and that's because the international community is unable to recognize the taliban government because of your terrible human rights abuses happening here will you ever compromise on what your interpretation of very strict islamic laws uh for people listening sorry it's gonna be in foreign isn't it but the she asks why won't you roll back on your interpretation of islamic law and he just goes we know what islamic law is because it is islamic law because it's our culture and religion and she just like is dumbfounded looking at him like oh my gosh she doesn't just kind of have a mouth hanging wide open like what yeah it's it's it's mad it's like why won't you roll back sharia because we're implementing sharia we're an islamic party or islamic group you could call them implementing islamic law and she's asking why don't you get rid of the islamic law part i mean this is why i say it's a bit of a dance interest that's a whole platform womanist imagine you go to the communist party like this marxism stuff is just not flying is it slowly reaching through his shoe this whole interview that happens to be there let's go to the next one but surely to recognize the taliban government i mean you it's as simple as just putting systems in place i mean and being clear on what the specifics are for example say when girls are going to go back to school provide equal rights for men and women get rid of some of the draconian applications of sharia law afghanistan again it's surreal i mean you almost kind of feel it he's the taliban no but you almost kind of feel sympathy for him like he's talking to a toddler and he is rolling his eyes the whole way through like why is this not as simple for you it's like this western journalist is like why why won't you let women go to school and why won't you have women's rights that are allowed in the west you just because we have islamic values because we're an islamic country implementing islamic values stop interfering you know nothing of this place to be fair uh he did just end that off with we just don't want other people in uh interfering with afghanistan and it's like it's kind of got us well because well she is uh part of the west let's say and she's turning up me like why don't you do western things and he's like because i'm not bloody west now yep what were you expecting a big shot big shock i'm sorry again the minimum level of shock should be applied apparently and just to make the point we've made it before but we'll make it again we're just looking at the pew polling so this is a pew poll we can get up here which was taken when we as nato the americans were in afghanistan we ran the place pretty much with them or at least with some of them and well the polling was done free and fair of the afghan people and as you can see they asked the question pew favor or oppose making sharia the law of the land 99 of afghanistan people said yes i want sharia as the law of the land that includes women was the one percent that that one woman doing the interview [Laughter] 85 of the afghan public wanted stoning for adultery oh my god just keep this in mind this is why i am not shocked and why i'm not even outraged why are we even trying to change these parts of the world if they just want to live like this just we'll just leave them alone if you're looking for being the british empire and to reform the foreigners to stop being so civilized then yeah you can be like oh yeah we're going to reform the foreigners stop being so uncivilized we tried that for 20 years well we tried them along with the 20. yeah true then we gave up and left and if we go forward we can see why this is a pointless task it also kind of silly especially at this level let's go to the next clip in which you say she says that afghanistan is rated the worst place for women in the world it's his response afghanistan is consistently ranked the worst place to be a woman just look at his face she's like that's how we like it allah gave me strength to deal with this [ __ ] i imagine it's going through his head it's like why is your face not covered that's by the next one see his response under the previous government any form of abuse towards women was deemed a criminal act under the new taliban courts will that still be the case i mean that's not true women are still getting abused and you haven't really answered my question in that will there be a law in place where it is a criminal act to abuse a woman again her face there so she asks are you going to make essentially abusing women of the eagle uh he says we had no complaints we don't let them have complaints over here very much uh there are no days in chechnya moment and it's just whether no complaints it's not taking place she said well you haven't had are you gonna make it illegal even if there are no complaints it's just like well there are no complaints it's it's the taliban what what were you expecting to say and uh she looked very disappointed by that response i can't believe all of these taliban aren't feminists um yeah i don't know why you thought you were gonna go with that one and this is the funny thing because uh it's that's for people who may wonder about uh beating women in islam let's uh let's have a little game shall we what is the islamic interpretation of being your wife um oh no welcome to the show which we'll do with life this looks like a game show that's why i made the game show music because in my head that's what we're doing right now we're gonna have a little game show about what does islam say about being your wife because this is the thing what were you expecting from this interview with the mr taliban and uh this is memory tv quotes which if you haven't enjoyed memory tv memes google memory tv memes they are hilarious you're in for a good evening and here's some examples which uh welcome to the show which we will deal with wife beating today so if you go the next one we can see some of the discussions that take place on arab television in this case the shariah says beat them this is in regards to if you're white i assume that's a woman saying that as well yeah as a woman she's completely cool with it she's like well i deserve it what if i've done something wrong the the sharia is to beat me the islamic law is to beat me because it's islam it's not it's not a liberal it's not western it's putting them mildly look at the next one we can see uh someone talking about what you do before you start before you start beating your wife this man says you should always say in the name of allah and then be her that's the thing is we laugh at this stuff but it's awful this is the entire arab world i know that's why i say just if this is how they are we tried actually we tried for years i misspoke this is the entire islamic world yes and it's not just oh maybe this country doesn't have this as laura's except it doesn't matter i think what matters is the islamic law because that's the important part what is this islamic country's fundamental view on beating your wife according to their religion and as you can see we start it with uh in the name of allah i i just feel like we should leave these people to it and then just don't bring them over here those those are my two easy rules don't bring wife beating to the shores of britain yes please controversial i know right let's get the next one we can have some big old instructions about how to do it of course as well this is lifetime tv this is primetime tv just what do you do on tv in the islamic world well we have men with beards tell us about how to beat our wives oh you do you do life with love he says uh how does a husband beat their wife he gives her a disciplinary beating out of love he loves her the beating should be light and must make the wife feel her femininity and the husband's masculinity i've never felt more feminine than when my husband is beating me jesus christ besides the fetishes out there yeah that might work for some uh no no this is no this i don't want this i don't want this over here it's halal but it's definitely not permitted in the west no and uh in case you're wondering about it being permitted in the west so the religion of peace of course has its feelings of peace uh what does the west have um they they have barbarism let's go to the next one we can see another memory tv meme here some guy saying nowadays wife beating is illegal in the west illegal can you imagine such barbarism and the re-interviewer just says unbelievable i have to listen to her nagging day in day out and can't even show her the back of my hand this is the islamic world right we're not even getting to afghanistan levels of islamic world this is just various places we call them barbaric for beating their wives and they call us barbaric for not beating our wives yeah these two cultures are completely incompatible with one another i mean more evidence do you need more we've got more what you thought mr taliban might have said about abuse of women it i i yeah no wonder there's been no complaints i mean what were you expecting and uh and then he just has probably the most frank discussion with the lady uh because the lady asks about you know you bring out the old faithful of arguing with a barbarian who thinks that women shouldn't have rights and you go uh well you have a daughter shouldn't she have rights uh he responds with a chad no let's play the clip i mean i don't think that's true i think a lot of the women that we spoke to were severely abused and extremely traumatized you have a daughter do you think that she deserves equal rights when she grows up to be a woman [Music] [Music] once again this is like negotiating with a brick wall what do you expect this is all simple to him this is natural to him it's like going to a liberal and being like oh should people have rights this is like yeah well yeah dummy but these people aren't liberals yeah so you know it's like moving to the united states and be like why don't you just have a communist dictatorship run by the chairman it's like oh yeah yes that's dumb john pointing out we should probably uh yeah we have done as i mentioned there's his response there was just to say no well they shouldn't have rights he also says there are laws for women and there are laws for men we don't have 50 50 50 equal rule yeah which is very very obvious islam what are you expecting yeah i know it's a shock it's just what a weird interview and that's why i definitely wanted to go over it and also because his responses are really funny as even even if of course this is barbarism it's funny i am genuinely interested to see what that documentary will turn out like because vice have done nothing good that i've seen for a very long time so it looks like they're at least doing something interesting yeah and there's um there's there's a sensibility there as well which is just yeah it's afghanistan what were you expecting but also it's afghanistan what were you hoping to do because you may wonder and you may think okay well maybe such humility for a situation a serious one in which people are being beaten day in day out for things that we wouldn't consider crimes of course just innocent things and uh well maybe we should use force why wouldn't she why wouldn't we try and use force to try and stop those kind of injustices around the world maybe military force we tried i mean afghanistan is just the perfect example of we tried for 20 years that we lost we lost big time and zamor has some answers to this so this is part of a premium podcast we're going to do some other point about eric symmore and he was asked about this exact situation about the same time so i thought it's definitely worth mentioning and uh so this is an interview you had with french tv and there's this channel here in case you want to see some more bass more stuff in which these translated into english um he's asked about his policy for asylum seekers and he says well i'm just going to have freedom fighters no one else pretty sensible and then we'll see the interviewer put to him the question of afghan women let's play that club afghanistan [Music] brilliant answer great answer do you want to explain that for those who are we're going to go through it for people listening as well so i mean he just mentions that well afghan women aren't freedom fighters that they're not victor hugo or shoshonetson because well they are people well they are individuals who belong to a people who have their own very distinct history and culture and beliefs yeah afghan women belong to the afghan people as in they are of afghan people and therefore afghanistan's barbarism and backwardness is because of afghanistan regardless of your opinions on the whole thing it's an islamic country it's been taken over by islamists yeah it's not a problem and if you think okay no that is our problem well okay now you need to invade literally like three quarters of the planet to try and make it western it's it's a non-argument to be like well he's just suffering therefore he had a great little sound bite there as well which is that i am not the santa claus of humanity yeah it's terrible yeah for us it's terrible in our eyes but it's not our place is it it's not our country it is barbaric it is terrible uh but we're not the santa clause of humanity as you say yeah if we're not a nation that any longer really uh thrives on warfare if we don't want to you know just empire empire are we there to civilize them no that's what we used to do we don't do it anymore we're past that now we've seen in these parts of the world it just doesn't work so i think it's time to cut our losses as we have done particularly with afghanistan there but uh so you mentioned the fact that uh individuals belong to people their cultures and their histories which do not call it a grave is the future the muslims chose and it's not just afghanistan of course i mean there are plenty of other human rights abuses in all over the muslim world but again not our problem simple as that i am he says also i am not here to give moral lessons to seven billion people yeah he's here for the french to defend france that's that is what he's there for he's the ruler of the french if he wants to be as the prince president and he says i'm nor am i here to welcome the misery of the world well it's fantastic that's what europe's been doing for the past who knows how long and look what it's got us so far but he makes the point with his is uh asylum policy it's like france takes like what was it 200 000 asylum applications every year some ridiculous number yeah they used to take 300 in 1950 that sounds much more reasonable to me and he's like well that's what we should do we used to do it it was freedom fighters only we'll do that not the miseries of the world can come here because where i live is awful yeah of course it's awful well then that's when you open up the open up the floodgates for anybody to just go oh my life was miserable wherever you get economic migrants no it's terrible like most of the world is terrible yeah like if you're just going to accept that because world terrible you have right to be in france a country on the other side of the planet well then the entire world has the right to be in france you've not solved anything in fact you've reduced all thinking nothing as long as they all just stay in france so i don't have too much of a problem yeah so they come over here afterwards the questions are more supposing though is just why should we waste more lives and treasure on the misery of foreigners who have inflicted essentially upon themselves on a let's say a collectivist basis though as well but i thought i'd done this off because uh this that was all funny and and good so i thought there's something off with another laugh so just to mention as well uh because i know some people like reading wrong doing a book club on this book the looming tower if you wanna look it up this is where this is from this is a quote about the taliban when they took over that i found in there back when they first took over it's just it's just funny so i'm just gonna read it because it is just these people are lunatics in here the animals in the zoo those that had not been stolen in previous administrations were slain or left to starve one zealous perhaps mad taliban jumped into a bear's cage and cut off its nose reportedly because the animal's beard was not long enough remember under the taliban you have to have a beard as long as your fist why do i care about bear beards mad i think actually mad i think perhaps matt is certainly mad yes another fighter intoxicated by the events of his own power uh leaped into the lion's den and cried out i am the lion now the lion killed him he's incredible i have the lion [Laughter] don't think so another taliban soldier threw a grenade into the den blinding the animal these two the noseless bear and the blind lion together with two wolves were the only animals that survived the taliban rule throw dogs throw a reason to the dogs read a sign posted outside the walls of the office of the religious police who were trained by the saudis it stinks of corruption these are the people you're dealing with right i i just despair for the for the people who honestly believe that there is something to be done here in trying to make these people western liberal folks the the the old adage don't negotiate with terrorists means you can't negotiate with terrorists yeah i mean look at these people bush's thing but it's more it's more for me i'm just looking at this lie i don't know if you can reason with stupid and it's a man shout he was a lion and got eaten by a lion i think that's that's all negotiation sorted i i don't know what more to say i it's it's yeah the foreigners are bad and the foreigners do weird mad foreign things and quite frankly that is the weird mad foreigners problem if you enjoyed that
