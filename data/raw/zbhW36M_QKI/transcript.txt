[Music] yeah R Kelly didn't do that Robert Kelly did legal age is 16 years old I want to see a black man who came so far almost to a billion dollars fow down that's our every other day the public becomes aware of how a famous man abused a woman and every other day the public makes Heroes out of those men and villains out of their victims there is no greater example of this in recent history than the ratory lanes who not only shot the rapper Megan the stallion but he launched a yearslong smear campaign against her that gained him a fan base of black men all over the world devoted to berating the woman who tried to protect him and landed himself in prison for 10 years I'm a criminal defense attorney who's represented hundreds of men accused of crimes including violence against women and never once did I struggle with this or secretly roote against gangst my clients but when Tory Lan was convicted I was one of countless women happy to see it why because you gave us no other choice [Music] [Music] [Applause] my experience on the Internet is someone who opposes the criminal system policing and prisons has been an interesting one because on one hand I've have amassed the following of thousands of people who on places like Twitter followed me specifically because they claimed to share my belief that we should dismantle the criminal system that we have have that prisons are terrible places that do not prevent nor stop crime that police lie routinely and the media regularly takes police word as fact without any scrutiny and that criminal prosecution and incarceration are rarely the answer to whatever harm has occurred yet the same people who eat up those words in theory usually have visceral reactions whenever I apply those beliefs to real life cases especially if it concerns domestic violence or violence against women and I understand that we've been taught to believe that prison is the answer to wrongdoing that taking a accountability means being criminally prosecuted and convicted so it makes sense that people who rightly see men abusing women as wrong would believe those men should be thrown under the jail and unfortunately our Collective lived experience is that most times the only people who caution us against rushing to immediately condemn discard and are prosecute men accused of abusing women are those who are trying to deny dismiss or diminish the abuse it's usually those who do not have a problem with men abusing women and in the case of women who do this they're usually pick mes for abusers which is why on any occasion where the internet was virtually stoning some man at the very first whiff of a headline suggesting the abused a woman and I made the mistake of trying to introduce an abolitionist framework into the discourse I've had my ass handed to me by those who we call carceral feminists who don't give a why it's problematic that people who claim to be abolitionists that oppose punitive criminal systems that condemn and discard people are quick to adopt those same punitive attitudes and practices within their Social Circles and communities before knowing anything beyond a headline and a police account if you've never heard of carceral feminism the term was coined by Elizabeth Bernstein in her 2017 essay the sexual politics of new abolitionism the term is not a complimentary one and it refers to feminists who not only want to rely on the criminal system for dealing with issues of gender-based violence they want to throw the book at abusers who they believe cannot be reformed who they believe are innately violent and need to be kept away from the rest of us so carceral feminism is in ttention with abolition for obvious reasons but while I don't like carceral feminism especially how it shows up on social media because I don't think it will accomplish anything but expanding the prison industrial complex I've come to realize that dismissing why carceral feminists feel the way they do is a mistake because the reason they feel the way they do is valid and until we address the problem carceral feminists have there is no path to abolition or Redemption for men who commit harm because the truth is I think most reasonable women including myself have a little carceral feminist in us because how how could we not why would we not I chose to use ground news when doing my research for Productions like these because not only does their app and website let you compare how the media is framing any given story worldwide and get contacts on each Source in this particular climate where everyone's targeting you with click baited misinformation where it's hard to tell what's real what's fake news and what's just straight up propaganda and maybe even AI a tool like round news is invaluable especially when I'm doing research on something as sensitive as Tory Lane shooting Megan the stallion and the additional restraining order she requested against him we can see that over a 100 articles were published on this story with only 7% of them being right leaning this Under reporting on the right side can indicate a disproportionate blind spot on that side and I'm sure you can imagine what kind of blind spot might exist seeing as this is a case involving violence against a black woman in music let's compare the difference in reporting between how some right-leaning Outlets framed the assault versus how more left leaning sources did we can see that the left leaning sources highlight the fact that Megan has requested a restraining order due to the harassment while right leaning s ources highlight the possible media attention this may Garner one of my favorite features of ground news is the blind spot report which allows you to see stories like these maybe disproportionately covered by the left or the right allowing you a chance to step out of your Echo Chambers Brown news just really can't be beat because it makes it easy for me to make sure that I'm not just spewing

find themselves rooting to to throw abusive under the jail well it's because we haven't been given any other choice and I think there is no greater proof of that than the vilification of Megan dallion I'm a black woman and a criminal defense attorney but I'm also a woman who has experienced domestic violence and an abolitionist those things do not conflict but during the trial against Tory Lan as someone who was not rooting for him to beat the case people assume that they must but I maintain that believe it or not everything that unfolded since Tory Lane shot Magna stallion makes it case for abolition and illustrates how our criminal system serves as an impediment to truly taking accountability and addressing harm stay with me condemning crime is not the same as solving it to solve crime you must prevent it and you can only do that by interrogating and understanding how and why the crime came about the root cause so that you can address it abolition is about preventing harm and the fundamental recognition that what we're doing now mass incarceration does not do that because it's not meant to and instead it makes matters worse because it's meant to yet we are invested in treating criminal convictions and incarcerations as the answer to all of our problems as being synonymous with Justice so we refuse to interrogate our issues without the legal system or to hold each other accountable without it what's worse is we often can't hold each other accountable for harm we've caused in honest healing non-punitive ways that help address and correct that behavior because the threat of our criminal system stands in tension with that let me explain what I mean I was relieved and honestly happy happy for Meg to stallion when Tory Lanes was found guilty of all his charges I did not feel that way because I was especially outraged by his crime or because I think his conviction or any conviction constitutes Justice nor because I think he deserves prison or that incarcerating him will benefit anyone change what's been done or prevented from happening in the future over four years ago Tory Lan shot Megan the stallion in her foot initially we only knew she'd been shot and everyone assumed Tori did it but Meg said nothing the internet responded with countless memes and jokes about Tori shooting her that's important because the people who now hate Meg and Champion Tory lanes and artists who wouldn't have crossed their minds if they've been asked to name their top 50 rappers of today would have you believe that that hatred does not come from misogyny that it is solely the result of their unshakable conviction that she is lying on an innocent black man they would have you believe that if they had a video of him shooting her if they knew he shot her without a single shadow of a doubt that they would sing a different tune that's why it's important to remember that initially before they cycle through these conspiracies see had the goalpost shifted from she was never shot to okay she was shot but she's lying about who shot her to [ __ ] shame in her to challenge her credibility while never addressing The credibility of the man actually on trial or the ly of things that diminished his credibility they assumed he shot her and they thought it was hilarious and Megan still said nothing then Tory Lan's apologized to Megan privately but even though Meg had remained silent and nothing suggested that she wanted to press charges against story tor's team who probably reasonably understood that it's the District Attorney's Office who presses the charges not the victim and in wanting to protect Tori from negative press they leaked stories to the blogs that would absolve him of wrongdoing which reasonably antagonized and upset mag it was then and only then that mag decided to tell the public how he'd shot her but she' protected him nonetheless because she was scared the police would brutalize them if she told them he had a gun or what he' done so she allowed the police to handcuff her and criminalize her to his benefit all whilst the bullet was in her foot and telling the truth prompted Tory Lanes to mercilessly attack her however he could doing things like making a music video where he chopped off a horse's foot That was supposed to represent her and thus fueling a massive hat train against the woman he liked because he foolishly thought his freedom depended on it that beating this woman down in the court of public opinion would change his chances at trial and the result was that for years swaps of black men artists and athletes like LeBron James who had never given him a second thought and even disliked him in some cases like Drake began trying to iconify him and Ascend him to this unearned importance in the community shouting him out uplifting his music and thoughtlessly criticizing Meg this getting shot but she still a stallion when they were chastised for it they all responded including Tori himself with some variation of wait until the trial the truth will come out at trial you'll all be so sorry when tor's found innocent I highlighted they to emphasize this point it was was tor's supporters who chose the outcome of the trial as The Benchmark here they announced to us that they would treat the outcome of the trial as the Arbiter of Truth as the final word not us abolitionists know women know domestic violence survivors know black people know that the criminal system is not about Justice that trials rarely provide clarity as Toad the facts that judges and juries are just human beings with biases and blind spots and can get it wrong that you could be guilty of a crime and still neither you the victim more Society are made whole or better by convicting Andor incarcerating you we know that but the people championing Tory drew that Line in the Sand anyway that is why I was happy for mag that is why I was relieved Tori was convicted because if he hadn't been the Agents of misogyny had made it Clare that they Not only would have tortured Meg but they continue to torture every woman who's ever been in her position and those who have yet to be but may feel too afraid of being met with the same response to speak up when it happens to them and while it's why I was relieved it's also precisely why I believe in abolition because we live in a society that has taught us that the only metric for justice is a system that we know doesn't bring it about so we still rely on it to be the deciding factor and on top of that just the existence of this system prevented the parties involved from pursuing another path think about it it's quite possible that in a different world Tori who had already apologized to Meg and multiple parties involved in private would have felt comfortable taking responsibility for his actions and atoning some other way had taken responsibility not come at the cost of his freedom it's just as likely that in a world where tor's team wasn't worried the District Attorney's Office could and would press charges regardless of the victim's wants in silence they wouldn't have felt compelled to leak counternarratives to blogs that antagonized mag into cooperating with their case against Tori imagine a world where Tori could have owned what he did addressed what caused him to act that way and correct that behavior imagine a world where we as a society address those issues and the issues of the people that seek to excuse CH his behavior rather than weaponize a criminal system against each other knowing that system is itself a weapon formed against us all but that's not what happened because not only is that not the world we live in in addition to the limitations imposed by the criminal system the reality is and has always been that whenever a black woman is the victim of abuse at the hands of a man no matter what the circumstances she will be made to answer for her own pain and turned into either the butt of the joke or a villain people become contortionists to a whole trial against black women for the harm they suffered to determine the Myriad of ways they were both to blame for it and deserving of it and it's this fact standing in the way of abolition because the vilification of victims isn't a horrible thing that may happen if they speak up about their abuse it's what will happen it's guaranteed this is what I call the abuser's second act and on some level it's even worse than the First Act the abuse itself because not only has the victim already had to suffer the original abuse use the public is not now only going to become accessories after the fact of the crime because they are going to help the abuser Gaslight disparage and verbally beat their victim into silence but because this is happening in the public sphere the intended victim is not the only one made to experience the trauma of this second act this public lashing is felt by all victims and it's society's constant infliction of this second act on victims who not only have to experience their own first and second acts but who know that they're going to have to experience that second act each and every time a woman's abuse is made public it's that that burst carceral feminism and the knee-jerk reaction to convict and condemn alleged abusers in the court of public opinion without a trial because they know because we know it's what will absolutely be done to any and every potential victim that's where the Primal urge to lean into punitive measures for men who put us all through this second act comes from carceral feminism is born out of the truth that there is literally no path a woman can take especially black women but it's true of all women there is no path a woman can take that Society will not oppose discredit and vilify her for Megan was proof of that but we have countless examples take robin given in 1988 she filed for divorce for Mike Tyson because he violently beat her and had a volatile temper and we know that Mike Tyson abused her in his own 1989 biography fire and fear the inside story of Mike Tyson Mike Tyson is quoted quote I like to hurt women when I make love to them it gives me pleasure he specifically called punching robbing given quote the best punch I've ever thrown in my entire life it was when I fought Robin in Steve lot's apartment she really offended me and I went bam she flew backwards hitting every wall in the apartment that was the best punch I've ever thrown in my entire life and yet this is how the media framed Robin given you know what people write about you say about you you know this is the beautiful glamorous actress with her beautiful glamorous mother who are out to ruin this basically I don't know what tough guy naive yes she was called Everything But A Child of God a gold digger the most hated woman in America to this day on her Wikipedia page where it discusses her relationship with Tyson the people who wrote it are still trying to frame her as the villain by saying she didn't never prenup that she made up her miscarriage that she and her mom was spending his money even though Robin given sat next to Mike Tyson across from Barbara Walters and told the world he was violent and volatile and he sat right there next to her and he did not deny it because he could not deny it Robin some of the things that we've read that he's hit you that he's chased you and your mother around in in Russia that Mike has a very volatile temper true extremely volatile temper I think people see that about every 3 months he's got a side to him that's scary Michael is a manic depressive he is I mean that's just a fact and uh when he's in a manic State he doesn't sleep he has enormous amounts of energy so you're sleeping agitates him he gets you up there's an argument I mean of course you want to sleep he so you run out of the room and he runs after you right and people see this and it's in the paper right what he did deny was the idea that Robin was spending lavishly that she was a gold digger you you said all your Millions Robin could have anything she wanted does she ask for a lot does she spend a lot no I have to force her to buy things I have to force her to to dress a certain way that like she wants to go out with jeans and boots this is how the world responded to Robin given when she didn't even ask them for anything not from them nor from Mike Tyson she didn't ask for him to be prosecuted so you can't say she tried to send a black man to jail she didn't sue him in civil court for money for abusing her all she wanted was a divorce and a restraining order and in order to do that she cited spousal abuse so she had to tell her story about her abuse and for that a world who had nothing to do with it decided that they hate her that she must be a gold digger and thus lying about the abuse the abuser himself did not and could not deny people can know know with certainty that a woman was abused and still refused to lend her sympathy take Tina Turner not only did the 1993 movie What's Love Got to Do With It starring Angela Basset and Lawrence Fishburn depict the real life story of Ike and Tina Turner's life where he beat her mercilessly for 16 years in real life Ike Turner could barely bring himself to deny the abuse because he wanted his abuse to be attributed as the reason for her success if everything Tina says about you you is true then you're a bad man well well I would say this uh maybe so if it was true but if that's what it took to make her what she is today then I have no regrets there's no scars on Tina you can take a real close look at her what I did do to Tina it's like uh uh we've had uh I've snapped Tina uh the only time I ever punched Tina in my life was the last fight that we had and and and and that was uh in Dallas Texas uh this is the last time we broke up uh uh uh uh I have snapped her any time uh when I said slap to her it's like uh I think we lived a lie he was allowed to just continue on he wasn't banished to the Shadows he wasn't truly shamed and what's Wild is that we know about I's abuse because Tina decided to write a book about her life and tell her story in order to explain to her critics why she left Ike only for her abuse to become a joke and a meme even after she's passed on take D Barnes in 1990 D Barnes had a hip-hop show called pump it up and on that show Ice Cube not de Barnes dis and wa and because Dr Dre did not like what Ice Cube had to say when he ran into a 22-year-old D Barnes in a Hollywood nightclub on January 27 1991 DN said he picked her up by her hair unprovoked and began slamming her head in the right side of her body repeatedly against a brick wall near the stairway as his bodyguard held off the crowd with a gun and after he tried to throw her down the stairs and failed he began kicking her in the ribs and hands she escaped and ran into the women's restroom and he followed her he followed P her into the women's restroom and grabbed her from behind by the hair again and proceeded to punch her in the back of the head before he and his bodyguard ran from the building and there is absolutely no disputing that this is what Dr Dre did to her in a crowded Club in front of witnesses he pleaded no contest to it yet people spread rumors that she was only suing Dr Dre because he hadn't promoted a project of hers and this is what Dr Dre's group members in NWA had to say she got beat down the person the host of that show did something and she know what she did and got beat down and I hope it happen again see you around buddy boy what was that Ren huh what' she do that would that what did she do what did she do that created the situation and made it that bad tried to make us look stupid tried to play us is that National TV tried to play us on national TV tried to play us in front of millions of people it's not over yet D barnes's lawyers say they're obtaining a restraining order against Dre who they claim has continued to threaten Barnes and the larger communities respons were very similar to that and that's not even the only woman that we know for a fact Dr Dre has brutally abused think about Mish and the community is excused Dr Dre's abuse against women for decades continuing to celebrate him take Kiki Palmer who despite being allegedly loved and cherished by the black community that has watched her grow up since Aila and the beat saw firsthand how the community that loves you will discredit you if you try to speak up against a man today Treyon has repeatedly been accused of rape and sexual assault he's been accused of so much abuse of women that I cannot keep up and he's been arrested numerous times for violence lwd behavior and more but before Trey songs being an abuser became common knowledge Kiki Palmer tried to tell us what he was in 2017 and people didn't want to believe it something Kiki would later point out in The Breakfast Club after other people started speaking up against him did you and other Trey songs ever get cool again man you know I have not talked to that guy was it a misunderstanding you know it wasn't a Mis it wasn't a misund told her story of I tell my truth and you know I just thought it was real interesting that after all those things went down someone else has something to say first of all I love people I love my people I'm not going to try to ever tear nobody down try to tear no black man down that's not who I am you know what I'm saying like that's not what I stand for that's not what I'm about so if I say something I'm saying something for a reason and I feel like so many times black women say stuff and nobody gives a [ __ ] but somebody of another complexion somebody of another color they say something and then it's like we're taking it to court it's time to get serious # me too and she's right because in 2017 when she spoke up when it happened Wendy williams' response to Kiki story was very representative of the vocal majority Kiki Kiki Palmer you're going to sit down right next to Madonna and Kiki I like you you're a friend to my radio show you're a friend to my TV show but I'm a straight shooter and I got a Pap out so Kiki Palmer is fighting with Trey songs the singer apparently Kiki is accusing Trey songs of secretly filming her and putting her in his new video there was a party at Trey song's house and Kiki was there there's a song that Trey songs does in the song it's not like he says the best things about her he says something about you know I want to Palm her our president's favorite p word uhhuh I so so that's what he says about Kiki Palmer and I guess she felt like and Wendy was so comfortable with this the popular opinion that she said it to Kiki's face giving Kiki no choice but to check her in person and make light of a serious situation you know what Kiki honestly when I told the story about try songs I thought you'd be like some people might be like she talked about me on hot topics now I don't want to go on her show even though you were already booked you are a girl after my no she you tell the rest and what all that happened well you know because you done told everybody especially okay but I don't want to I don't want to keep broad beating that one situation but I will say Wendy I would have love to turn on your show and saw you be a little bit more compassionate and less accusatory and ridicu I couldn't I could girl the gag is you wasn't there well and that wouldn't even be the last time Kiki would have to grit her teeth and Bear Community minimizing a man's abuse towards her because in 2023 it's been one year since Kiki and ex-boyfriend Darius Jackson's relationship Came Crashing Down and ended up in court with allegations of domestic violence and a custody battle over now 20-month-old son Leo in November Kiki was granted a temporary restraining order after submitting screenshots of multiple alleged physical assaults captured by her security camera Darius first publicized their relationship troubles in in a social media post criticizing a dress she wore to an usher concert quote it's the outfit though you a mom I randomly was on my phone and at sawar shav post of the comment and I was just I was honestly just shock the 31-year-old sat with people for their new cover story ahead of releasing her new Memoir master of me in it she writes quote I wish I could say he was terrible the entire time or that I was but it wasn't that black and white we saw with our own eyes Kiki's child's father Darius a man none of us know from Adam Abus Kiki someone we've loved for decades and all the public who she asked nothing of seemed to care about was joining him and [ __ ] shaming her over a dry War to a Nasha concert take Cassie Ventura Cassie filed a jaw-dropping lawsuit against Diddy for years of physical and sexual abuse and Diddy settled the lawsuit in less than 24 hours yet the public discourse accused her of only wanting money of trying to bring this black man down only for footage to leak of Cassie trying to escape didy only to be punted like a football and dragged like an animal and I can tell you countless other women's stories to illustrate to you how the world responds to black women's abuse but I would rather tell you my own abolition isn't just about abolishing prisons and leaving the world as it is I know that's what people think but that's not what it means in order to have a world without prisons we must first rid ourselves of the harm we pretend to use prisons to address and to do that we must not only address the root causes of that harm but also the beliefs attitudes and behaviors preventing us from employing alternatives to incarceration and reimagining what Justice is meaning it is insufficient to imagine a world without prisons where women do not have to feel relieved that Tory Lanes was convicted because men won't be awaiting an acquittal to weaponize against us without also acknowledging why that's not the world we live in imagining an abolitionist future requires us to contend with the present reality that our world not only refuses to protect black women but it also violently lashes out on women who try to protect ourselves I've never referred to myself as either a victim or a survivor of domestic violence because once you do it becomes Central to people's assumptions about you and what you must believe or be triggered by those assumptions don't usually line up with my reality as I'm a woman who became a defense attorney after it happened to me and I have no special hatred hang up or qualms with people accused of domestic violence or with representing them so on the few occasions I have mentioned my experience it's been just that a mention offered up in a usually heavily watered down manner that admittedly usually centers and humanizes the man who abused me only to rebut the assumption that as an abolitionist I've never experienced crime and would feel differently if I had to and to assert that I wholeheartedly believe the involvement of the criminal system could not make me or him whole nor could it prevent another woman from experiencing what I did for many years I hadn't actually ever told the story especially not for the purposes of sharing what happened to me because I didn't really see how such a deeply personal pain could matter to anyone but me but when people couldn't understand why so so many black women were relieved when Tory Lanes was convicted when they couldn't understand why we felt so strongly about how mag was being treated and the certainty in which we knew she and other women would be mistreated in the aftermath of an aquid I realized that what they were missing was reality the reality that what happened to Meg is not an anomaly that every day regular degular black women and girls experience a microcosm of what the world did to mag and that there's no reimagining a world without prisons without f Reckoning with that this is how I like so many other black women know what it's like to protect a man who attacked you risked your life and somehow still be made the villain in one of the most traumatic experiences of your life on April 25th 2014 I was a 20-year-old Junior at Ohio University in Athens Ohio living off campus with my then boyfriend whom hadd been with a year and who had recently joined a historically black fraternity solely because I had introduced him to the members and paid his dues when his white mother refused that night my sority was throwing a joint party with his fraternity at the party a fight broke out between his and another fraternity the fight was quickly resolved for all of the other participants but not for my then boyfriend he ran down the street and returned with a paddle he had apparently gotten from the trunk of his car and he tried to further escalate the fights despite being sorely outnumbered and I was friends with all the men he was trying to fight so I begged them to spare him and they agreed my friend Leon and I then dragged him down the street where he continued to AR argue with us because he wanted to return to the fight but to the police driving by it looked like he was fighting with my friends so they stopped to ask her if she was okay she said she was but he started arguing with them about why they were stopping him and questioning him so they handcuffed him and put him in their back seat I spent at least 30 minutes pleading with the police to let him go and surprisingly they eventually agreed on the condition that he apologized so I then spent another 20 minutes pleading with him to apologize to the police and assuring him that I knew he should not have to apolog oliz but I promised that we could unpack it together once they let you go and we get home safe eventually he begrudgingly apologized to them the moment the police uncuffed him he darted down the street to his park car but the police had given me his car keys because he was too drunk to drive so I just followed slowly behind him to the car accompanied by my friend at the police had assumed he was fighting with and one of his fraternity Brothers I vividly remember pulling up to our apartment building because it was raining and he jumped out of the car before I even brought the car to a complete stop and I had on this pair of rebot comicazi had gotten for Christmas that I remember watching get muddied as I followed behind him because he was running through the wet grass and I kept those shoes and I still have those shoes once we were inside the apartment he did not go to either of our two bedrooms he instead threw himself onto the couch in the living room and began to yell at me for wanting him to go to jail and I remember being flabbergasted like I literally just got done talking this man out a handcuffs out of the police car and out of the criminal charges they've been ready to slap him with and there he was telling me I want him to go to jail which by the way looking back on now as a criminal defense attorney I wasn't half as outraged as I deserve to be because I would never encourage anyone to talk to the police or to believe that they could talk the police out of making an arrest they had already made that was the rare exception to the rule and he didn't appreciate it so I decided I had enough I'd spent a year being tortured by his episodes and his undiagnosed issues and this was my limit so I said to him you know what I'm done and I left him on the couch and I went to our bedroom which was down the hall at the back of the apartment I changed into a large navy blue Tweety Bird t-shirt and I got in bed and I kept that shirt and I still have that shirt shortly after closing my eyes I heard him running full speed down the hall but it was so fast I'm telling youall before I could even fully open my eyes his H his hands were around my neck and that was the first time I truly ever experienced a man's strength I was scratching at him I was trying so hard to get his hands from around my neck and I remember the exact moment the Panic set in when I realized that no matter how hard I was trying I could not loosen his grip around my neck and he only stopped choking me just long enough to be able to grab me by my braids and fling me across the room and I'm telling you when he did that he ripped multiple braids from the front of my scalp and when I landed I tried to run and he grabbed me tearing my shirt he pulled me back down to the ground and he started kicking me in my head and I don't remember exactly how many times he kicked me but I remember telling the Doctor Who told me I had a concussion that I lost count after the 36 kick and I do remember that while he was kicking me he he was calling me by other people's names and he was screaming messages that seemed meant for whomever he seemed to be seeing instead of me and at some point the neighbors must have heard me screaming and crying for him to stop and called the police and the knock at the door startled him literally just long enough to give me an opportunity to run towards the door and when I opened it I was expecting to see my friends because they told me they plan to drop by because they were concerned about how he'd been acting all night but instead of it being my friends it was the same officers that I had convinced literally not even an hour earlier to release him like probably not even 30 minutes but my friend I initially expected to see did arrive moments later and they were with me as I sat on the floor and nothing but that torn up Tweety Bird shirt with braids visibly missing from my head crying and pleading with the police not to arrest him again I even told him to arrest me in his place which is so [ __ ] crazy and all while this is happening I can hear him in our bedroom screaming at the officers [ __ ] that [ __ ] in reference to me the woman protecting him to her detriment so I call his mother to help me convince the police not to arrest him he was black biracial but black but his mother was white so I the phone on speaker so that she could talk to the police and convince them not to arrest him but she told them to arrest him and they did and as they were dragging him out of the apartment I literally could hear him screaming begging them to please let me talk to my girl and when he called me from jail he cried about hurting me and how disappointed he was because as a black man he had always promised himself he would never go to jail that was a place he really never wanted to see himself in and I understood that and I told him how that understanding was precisely why I begged them not to arrest him in the first place and why I wasn't going to proceed with a case against them then I met with some of his fraternity brothers and his only friend who had come to our apartment to check on me and offer their condemnations of him because everyone knew what he did they knew exactly who he was two of them had literally witnessed many of the night's events but I still begged them I begged them not to ostracize him then his mom drove over 2 hours down to our apartment and told me I had quote brought this out of her son and it was my fault he'd attacked me because it was childish of me to tell him I was done with the relationship when he accused me of wanting him to go to jail mind you this was a woman who I had watched physically run from him in a mall in dayen Ohio months earlier and had warned me that I needed to decide if I could be with him because he was quote looking at her like he wants to beat her ass she then looked me dead in my eye told me that my name was not on the lease and that the order of protection the court would impose regardless of what I wanted meant that we could not be together despite living together and having no other place to go she put all my [ __ ] things in garbage bags and threw them outside this was the week before my finals so I went into my finals week homeless traumatized and exhausted on my friend's couch and exhausted because I wasn't allowed to go to sleep with a [ __ ] concussion despite that upon the advice of his attorney I wrote a leniency letter to the court explaining that he was an amazing person who was troubled but needed therapy and mental health treatment not criminal prosecution I took the bus with money I did not have to get the letter notorized and submitted to the court his mother and fraternity brother called to criticize me for for acknowledging any fault on his part and for saying in the letter that he needed mental health treatment but I did not know how else to write a letter supporting him without totally invalidating that he had [ __ ] attacked me and I refused to cooperate with the prosecutor and I ignored every call until they were forced to dismiss his case in the order of protection it was about a month or so between his arrest and the case's dismissal I know because I couldn't see him but I spent that time doing everything I could to protect him and I remember the weight of the depression I sank into when his fraternity brothers and my sorority sisters the same people I had begged not to ostracize him had instead decided to ostracize me when he was released from jail after arraignments one of his fraternity brothers who barely knew him did not like him who I had personally known for years saying to him I bet you can't wait to cut that [ __ ] off and they all laughed about how it wouldn't have happened if he' been with my lightskinned soror sisters he'd apparently tried getting with earlier in the night he attacked me they provided him physical shelter her to cheat on me at their homes people I had been friends with for years who had taken me to the hospital and sat with me when the doctor told me I had a concussion Shrugged their shoulders and told me that they did not believe he attacked me because despite the fact that he never denied what he' done to me and always appeared profoundly hurt ashamed and traumatized but a whole experience when he spoke to me while his case was open he either denied minimized or allowed his friends conspiracy theories to fly because he was afraid of going back to jail they painted him as this this light-skinned small and non-threatening Man versus a big dark black woman who must be secretly violent and adversarial I was a 5 foot2 woman who was asleep when he a 5' n man began choking me with all his strength instead of being a victim of domestic violence they called it a toxic relationship and painted this picture about Mutual violence where we must simply have a violent relationship where I must have attacked him and he just defended himself I have never put my hands on him or any other man and I was asleep but didn't stop them from constantly implying that I must have been the aggressor and raising all these new hypotheticals about my complicity and all these justifications for what he' done one of the worst lows I had ever felt was hearing someone say he attacked me and hearing someone who stood in my house as my friend respond well you know she's big and then erupt into laughter at the implication that my weight meant I couldn't be a victim and mind you I'm a regular size [ __ ] and this man is much larger than me I never imagined that I would feel gratitude to still have the shirt and shoes I wore the night he attacked me I'd never have fathomed that for my sanity I would need to look at that rip Tweety Bird shirt and the M no shoes just to be sure that something I lived through happened to me because people would Gaslight me so violently to make me wonder did I attack this man first when I know what happened I know that many people roll their eyes when they Heir protect black women because they perceive it as a self-indulgent rallying cry from a whiny interest group rather than a cry for help from whom Malcolm X described as the most unprotected disrespected and neglected group of women on the planet I'm not trying to convince anyone that they should protect black women I'm illustrating how I know that we are not even when we're the first people to protect our abusers we cannot live in a world without prisons where black women do not breathe a sigh of relief when a black man is convicted for abusing a black woman where Meg isn't forced to rely on the criminal system if we refuse to offer black women protection anywhere else within our communities if we want a world where there's Redemption for abusers we must first stop
