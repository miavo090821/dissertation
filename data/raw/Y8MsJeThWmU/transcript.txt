if you haven't seen it there is a viral clip on social media from Kai sinat twit stream where he and comedian ji are evaluating the looks of a darkskinned black woman despite this woman being 10 times more attractive than either of these young men that no one would take a second glance at if they weren't famous but it's very clear in the clips that they are trying to insinuate that this woman is a man or manly because as is the plight of black women particularly darkskinned black women you can see for yourself I show your ass um Jui would you like to see yeah I'm [ __ ] I'm ready go ahead and take your BL for off all right why you Qui it nah I'm just uh in shock what you in shock about damn okay okay can you get 360 yeah can I get a 360 real quick God damn okay okay uh it's just problem the silence n I'm good I'm just I don't like the silence it's scary me like I with i f i like lace red I like nail what titties body sitting No Cap though the body crazy that's just insane some of the features kind wait what what's going n what you mean the featur N she like when I felt the hands Ain get to see them what what the I bought her for you bro what is you talking about like what's why why they say jawline wait whoa what the nah no no no there is a lot to unpack there that we are not going to unpack because tons of people have already taken them to task for the very obvious colorism and transphobia taking place although I would be remiss if I didn't point out that for as much as people try to attack the lgbtq community under the false pretense that they're protecting their kids this right here women clapping ass while horny dumm pass judgment on them is actually what the kids are watching yeah it's not looking like the kids are all right cuz millions of them at that konat is one of the biggest streamers in the world and the kids love homie you remember you had them mbing in time squ had a moment's notice right but more importantly to me and what brings me here is there were people who had previously struggled with understanding the argument that transphobia impacts all women until seeing this Kai andrewy clip it was this particular tweet that actually inspired me to make this video this tweet Honestly made me so happy because I thought maybe there is some getting through the people maybe there are people we can reach if we show real world examples of how transphobia impacts all women so I am here to do just that mind you since we're kind of centering CIS women right here transphobia gets trans women killed regularly black Trans women more than others according to the Human Rights Campaign black Trans women make up 66% of all victims of fatal violence against trans and gender non-conforming people moreover most trans deaths go under reported so first and foremost it happens because of the bigotry within our social uh culture no matter what the race or you know the religious background of a lot of folks I think that socially we've all decided that you know trans people their identities and their pronouns are you know of no use to us especially after someone has passed and so what a lot of times folks will see is that families who do come and claim the bodies because often times our bodies are not claimed even by Family the families that do come and claim the body will then you know thrust upon us what they wish we would have lived as right so you might have a mom that will come and say although I know that you lived as Tanya I birthed you as Tori or Tony or whatever you know uh male Centric name that she gave her child and that will be what they give to the police or you know you just have some police that will look at genilia upon getting to the scene and say okay well this man was gunned down even though it is very clear that this person you know lived as a woman or was transgender there are so many um things that happen in particular on a regular basis the reason why we need to look at this is because it's used the numbers but alas some people have a hard time realizing why issue is important unless they understand how it affects them and I rather reach some people than shame them or indict them for a politic of selfishness so I wanted to provide some explanations and examples of the different kinds of ways transphobia harms even CIS women transphobia is not a trans problem it's all of ours especially black women specifically black CIS women and for the just hilariousness of the world who believe CIS is a new term that trans people just came up with and now we're all just running with it Goofy drunk you sitting up there on that mic calling yourself a cisgendered woman you didn't know you was a cisgendered woman until a transgender woman told you that I've been using cisgender since College where I learned it because it's actually a fairly academic term that dates all the way back to 1914 when a German doctor Ernst Bard introduced it and it has been commonly used in medicine and Academia since all cisgender means is that you are not trans that you identify with the sex you were born which you would think all all these women who so desperately want to distinguish themselves from trans women would be hyped to embrace it's almost like okay well check this out first of all you throwing too many big words at me okay now because I don't understand them I'm going to take them as disrespect but if you insist on being offended by the term cisgender I'm here to tell you right now we don't care but seriously it's not half as important to anyone including trans people as the hysteria from the people lashing out out of ignorance would have you believe you are a biological woman am I correct yes I don't want to use the term CIS cuz I know that it upsets a lot of people I know a lot of people get so I I I stick to the regular school I know there might be some trans people that that may be like you know but it's okay trans people we all right anyway that is not why we're here today A lot of people myself included have gone blue in the face trying to make women in particular black women understand that transphobia doesn't just hurt exclude and endanger trans women it hurts black women overall who have historically had our one Fem feminity and Womanhood disregarded two our physical features masculinized which will be a core element of this video and three denied the social standing and protection afforded to our white and non-black counterparts I remember the first time I encountered how black women's features are masculine eyes due to underlying transphobia although I wasn't old enough to understand why it was happening or why it was wrong but for those of us who are alive during the rise of Siara you remember the rumors that Siara was a trans woman and these weren't no little rumors this was not no little rumor this was 2005 before cell phones and social media were what they were and I was in the Bahamas so we were like 20 years behind and I heard the rumor I heard this rumor on the streets of Nassau Bahamas at 12 years old being repeated to me like it Wasing gospel from the Bible transphobia is so strong that that rumor made it all the way across the Atlantic Ocean and outside my great Grammy house in Oatfield so many people believe that that Siara felt compelled to address it um there's one thing about me being a a man or something like that before I was something when I was born I got a A Change really a Maite or something like that and they said that I went on Oprah and did and I'm like okay come on now you know if I was on Oprah like I mean it takes a while before that happens so somebody go to Oprah you know what I mean like that's really big so we know that didn't happen if you can find it though I'll give you 100 Grand and and follow you around the world and do everything for you if you can find that tape and playing for me people scrutinized every muscle on siara's body how deep her voice voice was whether she danced and dressed too masculine by the time she put out like a boy the transforms were forming at the mouse sun and this kind of masculinization of our features and transphobia directed at CIS black women is especially true for darkskinned black women what's made bad for all black women by racism is made worse for dark-skinned black women by colorism which coincidentally enough Jess hilarious herself is a living example of because she has constantly faced insinuations throughout her career that she's trans because of the way her features and voice are masculinized as a dark woman which she and everyone around her is aware of that's like that's like saying my best my best friends are black and you get misgendered a lot Jess which I hate what you get misgendered a lot oh yeah yeah yeah yes people always you know say I was born a man and all that and I hate that let me explain despite what the internet and real life colorists would have you believe colorism is neither about simple preference nor does it work in Reverse colorism refers to the Privileges granted based on how close your proximity to whiteness is as a result the darker you are the less privilege you receive and the less desirable you are so both darkskinned black women and men experience anti-blackness that is exacerbated by colorism that affects how we are perceived and how desirable we're considered but our gender changes that experience because a feature of colorism is that dark skin is considered more masculine while light skin is considered more feminine so what happens is darkskinned black women are seen as more masculine and lightskinned women are seen is more feminine and thus more desirable this phenomenon doesn't spare anyone it takes no prisoners not even the first black first lady of the United States of America our beloved Michelle Obama who was constantly accused of being a man being too masculine and having the size of her arms constantly assessed appeared to have a very large penis uh in her pants her shoulders are wide her face is very very masculine she looks like a [ __ ] and so you ask yourself are the children a beard for Obama uh and of course Michelle Obama or Michael Obama or just think about all the time Serena Williams has been called too masculine manly Savage had her beauty attacked from reporters saying that her competitors would not wish to emulate her muscular physique others asking her whether she was intimidated by the supermodel good looks of her white opponents Serena is a CIS woman but she was not protected from transphobia Serena told Harper Bazar UK that quote it was hard for me people would say I was born a guy all because of my arms or because I'm strong for dark skinned CIS black women being masculinized and stripped to femininity as a result of racism colorism and the transphobia combo pack does not just hurt feelings or make one feel undesirable or in the case of Serena Williams make competing in sports more difficult for some black women it has the power to prevent them from competing at all take for example track star and Olympic gold medalist cter Seena who is a CIS woman she is not trans World Athletics which is the governing board for track and F worldwide took it upon themselves to decide how high women CIS women born women's testosterone levels can be so casor Seena who is a woman but just as naturally higher levels of testosterone has had to start a whole damn Human Rights Campaign to run track her literal job for which she has won gold medals in the Olympics because these people are using transphobia to stop CIS black women who they can masc ized to the public from competing colorism is a byproduct of racism and the features of colorism the masculinization of dark skin fuels transphobia in the case of CIS black women and in the case of black men it's why darkskinned black men are seen as tougher stronger men while light-skinned men are seen as more feminine this is what motivates the discourse and perceptions of light-skinned men as soft but again colorism lends privilege the closer you are in proximity to whiteness so although light-skinned men do experience perceptions of softness and and challenges to their masculinity that are harmful and I'm sure painful they're still seeing as more desirable and thus are more protected and understand that for whatever gains dark-skinned black men's masculinity is afforded by virtue of this perception as stronger and tougher is lost to the effects of racism that leads them to be perceived as threats dangerous brutes although some darkskinned black men are able to navigate or make this aspect of colorism work for them by seeming more desirable to women who see them as more masculine young black boys do not have the same privilege because they're children so they don't truly have a masculinity to hide behind unless they act out and behave aggressively at which point they'll then be treated as dangerous and criminalized in some way which is why even darkskinned black men who as adults are traditionally and widely received as attractive often tell stories about having the opposite experience as children and having their sense of identity desirability and masculinity forever impacted Tay digs comes to mind seeing Tyson Beckford in the magazine means you know dark skinned shaved head muscular that L gave me something to strive towards because you didn't see a lot of that coming up you know when I was younger I would go in the mirror and try to get my nose to be skinnier and wonder what it was like to have like you know straighter hair I I I have a I have a trust issue with the public because you know I considered myself ve very um feeling very sensitive but also hyper logical I was I know on the on Jamaica you know I got all this this attention because I was this lead role I come back to New York City and you know once you finish a film you got to wait for it to to to be edited what not and I would go out to the clubs and I would get no play so this was a little bit of a mind I was like well I was in Jamaica but I look the same way what's going on so there was a disconnect um the day after the movie came out there was a difference and people were speaking to me on the street so so from that point on I was like maybe it's not me it's this character so um I've never really trusted hey heart throb and he all right well you call me what you want like you know yeah yeah so that's it's it's still an issue it was necessary I think to touch on colorism and how it also affects black men's masculinity and perceptions of self and Blackness but those are not the main topics of this video so I'll leave it there for now but if you do want to learn more about colorism I suggest you describe to mayowa's world who I'll link below and if if you want to dive deeper into this aspect of black men's masculinity I recommend you read B Hook's books the will to change and all about love as well as you could check out any number of videos by FD signifier for black women darkskinned black women in particular for the reasons given Above This perception of being more masculine does not just hurt one's feelings or destroy one's sense of self desirability and Womanhood it can and often does physically endanger black women as well as run the risk of costing us valuable rights take for example Michelle Deon peacock Michelle was 59 years old living in Richmond Indiana where she was battling cancer Michelle was a ciswoman she was not trans she had a family who loved her she had multiple children but because the man in the apartment next to her 67-year-old Tommy Wayne Earl thought she was trans he slit her throat because as he told the police she was quote a male acting like a woman and that he'd do it again if he got the chance after the kaat and drewski video came out consciously tried to explain to people how transphobic hurts all women and I saw a lot of black people nailing him to theing cross and saying that he just likes to think peace things to death but this [ __ ] is serious and he's right the Staggering and terrifying reality we need to take in is this in America black women are six times more likely to be killed than white women okay six times and black Trans women are even more likely to be murdered than cisgender women of all Races so combine the danger that black women already face as an protected group with the danger trans women regularly face both CIS and trans black women are in too vulnerable a position to continue dismissing the seriousness of what happens when we refuse to check transphobia at the door this isn't an indictment on kaai snat druski jessus or anyone else whose Kong shell Behavior I've used to illustrate some problems with our thinking it's a call for everyone to zoom out and see how these interactions we having all facilitate something much larger much more Insidious that has the power to harm us all did y'all know that bunnies are gangsters like bunny rabbits like straight up gangsters I saw this thread on Twitter where people who own rabbits were talking about how they got the second rabbit and then the other rabbit merked them so I went to and my editor Aaron Aaron has two bunnies so I went to Aaron like did you know that your rabbits are gangsters he's like yeah see he's like they're different than cats cats like to establish a hierarchy where they're in charge rabbits want to eliminate the threat he
