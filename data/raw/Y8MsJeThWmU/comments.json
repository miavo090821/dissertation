A father of one of my competitors was trying to get my results thrown out because I beat his daughter. Mind you, we were in 2 different weight classes and age groups so we weren't competing directly against each other anyway. I have always had more of a muscular build especially in my upper body. I always wore lots of makeup to these meets to present as feminine as possible to avoid this and it still happens and it is annoying.",

From childhood, I endured hurtful nicknames like \"Black Cat\" and \"Dark Vader,\" which made me resent my skin and African features. Growing up as the only black family in a predominantly white neighborhood only heightened these insecurities, pushing me to idealize lighter skin.\n\nIn my teens, I began to reclaim my blackness and appreciate the beauty of my people. However, the insidious nature of colorism crept in, leading me to prioritize lighter-skinned partners. I feared passing on the same painful experiences to potential children, so I made the misguided decision to avoid dark-skinned partners.\n\nAs I entered my twenties, I started to confront and challenge these biases. I realized the richness and depth of beauty within the black community, regardless of skin tone. Yet, despite this realization, I still find myself struggling to shake off the remnants of my past prejudices in my dating life.\n\nNow, in my thirties, I reflect on missed opportunities and the impact of my choices. I regret overlooking the stunning dark-skinned women who crossed my path, blinded by societal pressures and my own internalized biases. It's a painful reminder of the work that still needs to be done to dismantle colorism and fully appreciate the beauty of all shades within our community.",

I think what they mean is hearing black cis voices is especially empowering because cis/trans black women have more in common than we don't, and black centered solidarity is especially wholesome at times. But implying inadvertently that black is separate from trans is a bad move because these realities have the capacity to intersect.",

Two years ago, when fighting against the trans sports ban a young black trans woman with whom I'm in community testified arguing passionately that the bill may be motivated by transphobia, but the impacts would be felt by young black cis women whose femininity and right to compete would be challenged. Many of those young women wouldn't have the resources or support to fight back and would lose opportunities for athletics scholarships - often one of only a few ways that poor young black women have attending college.\n\nThere are many people, even within the trans community, who are unaffected by transmisogyny and don't understand how that unique form of oppression results in exclusion, marginalization, and often death. The fact that colorism and transmisogyny create these intersections is something that I truly hope more people can begin to understand.",

We can have better things and results for people. I just wish more people understood how these are tangled up rather than never effecting them (or affecting? I always get those confused).",

Also, transphobia is rooted in misogyny because how will we gatekeep women in a patriarchal society? Women are held up to a white, cishet patriarchal standard. While transphobia effects ciswomen in this hurtful and racialised misogynistic way, trans women are hurt and taken away from us from this misogyny and if unchecked the issues will increase regarding racialised women like dark skinned black women esp in this case who have been denies patriarchal femininity.",

It maps perfectly on to the gender identity definition and was easy to understand. It's not a made up term. It's just an application of academic language that these people don't understand because they're uneducated and arrogant enough to assume they understood everything there was to know about science in secondary school lol. Same way they make the argument around sex being a pure binary. It's like arguing with a 3 year old who thinks the teachers live at school.

        "text": "My parents were teachers so I didn’t know some kids think teachers live at school! Ahahahahahaha that’s a good one. \nAnyway it’s not really about whether they remember chemistry… the bigots don’t like losing their sense of being “the norm”, which to them means “the only valid possibility.” They prefer to be as unmarked as possible. In their minds, both trans and cis are markers and therefore potentially shameful or exotifying. So on one hand, it’s extremely important to them that they are not trans (ie cis), but they’ll take it as an insult if you use that as a modifier, like “cis accountant”. It’s not as inflammatory an issue with terms like straight/het and white, but it’s still there. People freak out if you call someone’s only niece a “straight niece” but it’s somehow fine to call someone’s only aunt a “gay aunt”. Or watch the fireworks if you “unnecessarily” use white as a modifier for someone (eg an actor), but they don’t mind saying “Asian-American actor”.",

It's always about hurting women in general, especially minorities who don't fit the white American pageant queen mold. To a lot of transphobes, the criteria for not being trans is whiteness. If you're not white and gender conforming, you are transgender in their eyes, and that is why so much transvestigation bullshit targets black women.

It is often depicted in Asian culture and religion before the famous constructs that divided Jews and Italians, maybe.  It is more certain to say Western colorism.  Hip-hop  has been been controlled or influenced by dark brown skin men's preferences for beauty so, it is there influence that has strongly exacerbated colorism and promoted colorism. Black women did not fight against this and there were plenty of opportunities. I always wondered about Oprah and her role to , but then again... Who is her man and do we assume there is no colorism involved given her history...  Did Ebony, Essence do enough? Colorism in the American Black community has a long history but hip-hop made it truly par for course favoring, not Drake, but ambiguously Black and Black adjacent influencers... The IG progeny of the video vixen( common knowledge,)... Still black women have power... And they do not use it. I really think that the deeper it truly goes... It critiques everyone. Make up itself emphasizes a European and Asian look for Black these days... I have seen black darker skin African women without the artificial esthetics and just a natural look... That has no colorism at all. I think it is very clear that a male having a white parent is as n advantage, but outside that... The  receipts of favoritism are harder to pin down by region. So, many light skin men in the spotlight do not have two black parents anymore...  Steph Curry and who else?",
