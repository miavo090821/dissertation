Near the end you mentioned how a lot of internet leftists like to describe themselves as several different kind of \"-ist's\" like Marxist-Maoist-Titoist-etc.\n\nI remember when I was a younger man and learning more about leftist ideologies I was very confused by people describing themselves as several peoples last names.\n\nI also want to thank you for mentioning how a lot of younger Americans who are getting into more leftist politics don't understand how \"indoctrinated\" they are through years of subconsciously listening to US propaganda",
