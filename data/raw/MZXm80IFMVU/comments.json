        "text": "Holy fuck I love this - I worked at a grocery store where managers/bosses/coworkers bullied the hell out of me. Like my manager and boss would literally yell at me almost daily for things I literally didn't do. Coworkers would blame things on me and make fun of me for being gay. The people who were nice there would ask if I was ok OFTEN. It really got to me and I started hating myself, like really bad...Then once I quit I was like \"why did I let these stupid ass people's opinions get to me????? they're not shit compared to me. And these couple of straight men making fun of me for being gay are asking me to suck their dick??? I actually let those dudes' comments get to me???\"\n\nI will say tho it can be hard to believe in yourself when you have so many people telling you that you suck. Anyways love this quote",

So Candace Owens is the more likable one and Amanda being Left Wing is more the villain now. Her talking points aligning too much for the democrats and left wing and the people not feeling that because of Joe Biden and Barack Obama perception being changed and outlets the Breakfast Club are still supporting the Democrats and the left wing B.S. Amanda is the villain now. The tables have just turned on who’s the heel and the face between Candace and Amanda. That’s all.",

I'll be sure to sub to them all! \n\nCouldn't agree more with y'all's takes on platforming, propaganda for the \"other side\" being baked into the equation, and why we should hold black media to a higher standard than MSM... If nothing else, i think it's safe to say leftists and black folks alike have understood how absolutely COOKED MSM is on both those respective topics (leftism and black issues). So black media and independent media are kinda our only real hope at this point.\n\n... Look, what I'm tryna say is i love you and appreciate you for all you  do! ♥️ \n\nKeep the faith, better tomorrows and such. 😉",

I'm no idiot but even just consuming youtube videos meant to teach and relay news burnt my ass out for over a year. \"Not everyone xan do everything\" and \"It's a priviledge to buy all these Black books and be able to read them\". Amanda, ma'am... I cannot be an activist. I can barely pay rent consistently in the last year. I had a health emergency last year that took me out for half a year. I am struggling, teetering on and off of depression RIGHT NOW. Bold and italicized. Periodt. Big dot. There's so much ish goin on for normal ahh people like me and we don't got the kind of access, the kind of social and monetary capital you got! Let me rest! I'm tired! Damn!\n\nThat being said, I'm really glad this episode encouraged me to give her more grace because how is it that she's so unlikeable but still able to constantly make progressive moves with her peers within the framework of the entertainment industry? That alone was a light switch in my head.  Could it not just be that these systemaic structures that we understand work against Black people are being weaponized against her? An outspoken Black woman? She isn't perfect, sure, but again I needed to give ger a bit more grace because she's also human and just trying to do her work in the service of Black people and progress. Regardless of my feelings on her messaging, I have to respect that.\n\nEdit: ALL THAT BEING SAID... I just watched Jouelzy's video on her and, uhm. There's a lot I wasn't aware of and a lot I now have issues with. I can still respect the resume but, baby, the deeply troubling colorism ish? The odd defenses of men like Jay-Z and her, frankly, harassment of Samira Rice? Somethin ain't right.",

The current sitting PRESIDENT doesn’t need to be platformed because he ALREADY HAS ONE! Like I said, you’re displaying that common sense is in fact not that common after all!",

    "text": "I agree with what you guys are saying about Candace. She does not deserve to have a platform. She has spewed so many racist things. Over the past decade, it's unbelievable, but the problem is that there are black people who get on YouTube and maybe because of their lack of education,  They look up to Candice Owens because they feel that because of the way she communicates she must be right. She's good at debating,  speaking loud over people so the  naive and those who lack understanding are decieved by her words. Also some people believe they can trust her because of her accent, the way she pronounces or they have never met another black person speak with proper english( which is sad) and they assume  that she must be smarter than everyone else. And unfortunately, they need to widen their circle and get to know more people that there are other black intelligent people. In fact, they need to read books, and that's the problem. People don't read if they would just read some books from some. Or maybe they could interview someone who's elderly who's lived throughout black history.  Then they would see that all the crap that Candice  is spewing and realize she is just following something from a white man who has a racist point of view. And I really am disturbed that The Breakfast Club even had an interview with her because it does elevate her to some of these people out here, especially young people. I think people of a certain age. It's just an incredible low that they would even have an interview with her and put her on any platform.",
