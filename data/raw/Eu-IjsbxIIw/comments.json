Anti-ACP communists are hypocrites since they are extremely socially liberal while also supporting people like Stalin, Yahya Sinwar, and Putin who would think they are degenerates. However, I am respectfully asking why Jackson Hinkle made racist comments about Indians. I understand that Marxism-Leninism is socially conservative but aren’t they against racism? The Indian government is very reactionary and pro-American but I can’t help but think these comments are incredibly racist, especially hinkle’s use of the word “Saar” created as a racial slur by 4chan neonazis https://youtube.com/shorts/qrfmgBJHzCU?si=w98uC83rypXNW7Sx",

        "text": "​@StrayChoom Lenin was not a Menshevik, he didn't say that capitalism (state capitalism or not) was necessary as a prior step to advanced socialism. Chinese authorities say today that capitalism is necessary as they first need to create wealth and raise the well being of the people in very broad terms. Lenin had a very different outlook, he said that State Capitalism should be a tactical retreat, and a short-lived one. The Chinese rule does not even has a roadmap to their transition to socialism, because it will never come.\nLenin's NEP had 2 main reasons: 1- Food. The peasants needed immediate incentives to produce and trade grain. 2- Investment / know how. Communists made the revolution but were basically ignorant about how to deal with practical things and they lacked machinery. Unfortunately they failed and didn't learn despite some success in getting foreign investment. The Chinese had much more time to learn, I wonder when they will start to move away from capitalism (never I guess).\nState Capitalism was a tool in a basic and initial form of primitive Socialism, Soviet Union was socialist as the political power was in the hands of the Soviets/Communist Party, a State Capitalism without Socialism would be useless for the Soviet Union. Read again the part where Lenin says that it is thanks to the Soviet political power that they are able to make a step back (not really back as capitalism in Imperial Russia was primitive - but we understand what Lenin meant).  So of course it was already socialism, but one in its infancy. Again, hard to tell when Chinese \"socialism\" will move away from his \"tactical\" retreat from the market economy with Chinese characteristics (whatever this is supposed to mean but for sure we will find a lot of orientalist and eloquent explanations on that).",

Eg. Tien Di Hui, Tien Di Hui Kao Lo Hui and Sam Di Hui; the leadership under Chien Duxiu of the 1911 Revolution; ie. the so called China Secret Societies; that the Brits called triads, but were the forerunners of the CP, including such orgnisations as CPX (Xianggang). So for USA we have CPUSA as the affilaite workers or CP body of USA..Can you do something about this. After all you are responsible for the USA now...Tien Loong Hui would have to be based in USA to intervene... thankfully we are China and have our own T'ong.

I’m going to assume good faith here and that you just made a mistake but none of what you said addressed the substance of my criticism. I’ll be honest though, it’s almost like you were deflecting or something. Like being a woman in leadership does not nullify the misogyny in your remarks (I.e. anything that has ever come out of Hilary Clinton’s mouth lol.) I should not have to go any further on that. That is lib behavior to think women are above misogyny (yourself included.) Also I think you’re being very generous with your interpretation of what she said in the tweet. Maybe you’ve had conversations with her where she’s expressed differently or she’s expressed differently publicly somewhere I’m unaware of (this video would be a great place to make that known btw) but she did not say anything about wanting women leadership to \"develop organically\" in the tweet provided. She actually said “there are enough women in leadership and membership of the ACP.\" One interpretation of that remark could be that there is no development of women leadership in ACP (“organically” or otherwise) because y’all have enough already. You’re at capacity for women leaders. Do you see how there is room for interpretation there? This really is irrelevant though because that one sentence is not what I was addressing. I was addressing the multiple sentences before that were, again, a slew of bioessentialist, misogynist tropes. I’ll go ahead and quote here so there’s no ambiguity: \"But who told you that women are craving to rule or lead? We are better at taking care of our children, the elderly, and our communities. We are nurturers by detault. Of course, there are exceptions, but genecally speaking, women want to be protected by physically stronger men…\" seriously, how did you not cringe reading that? Again, take this criticism seriously in good faith. I want ACP to be above that nonsense. I want ACP to be a party to build class consciousness not bury it in reactionary, backwards, wrongheadedness. If you can’t engage in criticism and self-criticism how do you expect to survive as a party?",

        "text": "@alexjeffrey3981 Section 7 of the party constitution, accessible on the ACP website (you can navigate to it via the Party Program page, then go to the \"Constitution\" section of the header on that page):\n\n\"Section 7:\r\nDiscrimination according to race, ethnicity, sex, or religious creed is strictly prohibited. To offend, demean or degrade the heritage of a given historically-constituted group is strictly prohibited. Any violation of the dignity and privacy of a given Party member on the basis of sex or other characteristics is strictly prohibited.\"\n\nOne thing I'll add; some people criticize it for it not explicitly referring to gender, but there are two points to contend against that: for one, the wording includes \"other characteristics\" and protects the dignity and privacy of party members very explicitly, and there are gender non-conforming members of the party. The second point is that, if individuals dislike this aspect of the constitution, the ACP as a party is open to critique, dialogue, and development, so should the party democratically decide that the wording should be more specific in its future meetings that can change.\n\nOr, to put it another way; if you are authentically a Communist, but you have criticisms about aspects of the party, you can still join the party and voice those concerns or issues and potentially see that change be realized. The ACP does not dogmatically stick behind the ideas of any individual, even those of Haz.",

The first issue is much deeper and I basically cannot in good faith call myself a supporter because of it, seeing as it is not the fault of individuals within the party but its theoretical standpoint that is the problem on that one for me. So I'll criticize the party on that one. But I really don't get why so many of your critics feel the need to twist your positions by appealing to preconceived notions mostly manufactured by online drama (albeit, that one's also kinda on the online-provocateur strategy of your party, partly) while doing so in a way which only betrays their pedestrian understanding of politics.

It’s pretty obvious that by “racism/sexism are illegal” I meant “there are laws designed to protect from racism/sexism such as domestic abuse laws, workplace discrimination, hate crime laws, etc.” yet these laws don’t mean that our system isn’t systemically racist or sexist. Even if you want to straw man my argument, our legal system in fact requires “a fair trial” yet looking at the outcomes of our legal system between ethnicities it’s clear racism still exists even if the foundational text/rules of that institution are designed to counteract or outright remove it. So when you say there isn’t anything against women in the ACP foundational documents, it means nothing when the actions of party leaders are clearly sexist and not being addressed.",
