    "text": "There’s a huge lesson in all of this. \n\nAs a Black politician, if you’re not careful, you can easily get caught up in the power and influence of your White colleagues, just like the Black politicians that were mentioned in the video. \n\nAlso, in this country, when you are a Black politicians, you are basically a Black employee working in a predominantly white workplace, and many of us know how that goes. The only difference is that you get hired by the people who voted for you while regular employees get hired by companies. In order to keep your job and even climb up the ladder, you have to do a whole bunch of butt-kissing, or you won’t last long. It’s the same thing with being a Black politician. \n\nThe late Congresswoman Shirley Chisholm is a good example of this. Her campaign focused on improving the lives of Black Americans, and she was part of the Women’s Liberation Movement. As a result, she didn’t get a lot of media coverage nor a lot of funding for her presidential campaign. She didn’t get any endorsements from the National Black Political Convention nor did she get any endorsements from major national women’s organizations. There were also tensions between Chisholm and the male-dominated Congressional Black Caucus. Now, if Chisolm would have decided to cower down and went along with the game, she probably would have had a better chance of getting nominated for the Democratic Party’s presidential pick, and this was the early 70s.",

Nor was the window tint bill she had passed. Her 'attempt' at cleaning up Kensington did nothing but effect surrounding families in the neighborhood when the drug dealers and homeless addicts started to make encampments on their blocks, disturbing their peace and not actually attacking the problem. She eliminate hybrid scheduling/the ability to work from home for city employees (while acting as if she didn't want to renegotiate with the union in a collective bargaining agreement)  and she's putting pressure on other business companies, privately owned companies, to follow suit and eliminate hybrid scheduling for their employees all to get people to spend money in a section of the city she was trying to RUIN!!!! by supporting a billionaires' bid to put a new basketball stadium on market street...goofy ass getting cussed out at town halls while trying to defend the idea of a stadium at market east... Ignoring the fact that Jefferson , Septa, Chinatown and many other groups and citizens stated valid, sensible reasons why the stadium would be a bad idea..how it would cripple center city. City council didn't stand on business, sided with the mayor in three consecutive 12-5 votes...only to look foolish when the billionaire used her and her council as leverage to get a new deal with Comcast and abandon plans to build the stadium down town ....Comes out in a press conference, like we are stupid, spinning it as if it was apart of her plan all along............yo.........I know she isn't the worse mayor of all time in this city but she is certainly making a case to be top 5 in history",

I always get the burn out, it's hard to care about a country that's sick and seems to be choosing essential oils over medicine these days :-/ Hope you are finding that fine line between giving up and letting go of the shit that is waying you down too heavy. Love the video! So well made.",

    "text": "Thank you for giving us all so much wisdom! Another YouTube creator that meant so much to me ended up coming very close to burning out and had to step aside. He had the foresight to see that if he didn't take a step back, he was going to collapse. He has been wise enough to have his wife take over the speaking/filming part of their channel, and has gone more towards the background work that they as a couple and their full support team do. \n\nHearing your words at the end of the video, I want to make sure you're putting on your own air mask before you try to save anyone else who is going down in this plane crash. \n\nI was not wise in my personal care, and the election results broke me. Even though I knew I was beginning to get overwhelmed and knew I needed to improve my self-care, I didn't put in enough personal time and work to prepare, and I hit a wall badly on November 6. \n\nYou know that you are greatly appreciated and you have a loving community. Please take care and don't ask more from yourself than is feasible. I only just found your channel, but have been so grateful for everything you have to say. As much urgency as we are all feeling right now, take your work at a  sustainable pace. \n💜🖤🤍♥️",
