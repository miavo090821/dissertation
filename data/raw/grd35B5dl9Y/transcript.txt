n [Music] I have been starting stopping scrapping and starting this video all over again all year literally since the top of the year when I became aware of DC mayor Mariel Bowser's crime bill by this video I mean the seven deadly sins of black politicians but like I said I've started and scrapped quite a few different versions of this video this year because how I feel keeps changing initially I was frustrated with the emergence of more and more black Mayors fighting against Progressive movements championing anti-black policies or outright turning their cities into police States and I thought the seven dead Leon framework would allow me to tackle many different politicians and what's happening on the ground for their black constituents and I thought that would be easy and fun so fair enough but then I started thinking about it either too much or just enough I'm not sure the jury is still out and then I thought well if I'm going to highlight specific actions taken by these politicians and classify them as the seven deadly sins of black politicians wouldn't their actions need to be perceived as sinful by the black majority or the majority of their constituents I thought it's probably flawed somehow to declare particular conduct by black politicians as deadly sins against the black community if black people don't generally disapprove of the conduct which ended up becoming a problem for me in my little seven deadly sins framework because the very core of Mike rrie with many of the black politicians who will find themselves in this video is their commitment to overp policing black people to over incarcerating black people to demonstrating to the white power structure that they have the ability to control black people to keep their black populations in line but the frustrating truth that I've been sitting with chewing over and mulling over especially when I really sat with James Foreman Junior's book locking up our own is that many black people certainly far more than those who identify as abolitionists believe in the criminal justice system in prisons in legal retribution in punishment in policing in Law and Order many black people believe we just need to be represented more in systems of power and that things will change but that some of us maybe even many of us need to be locked up but I want to be clear I know some of us love our children but some of our children are so far G but we going to have to put some of them to sleep in order to take back the neighborhood some of y'all don't want to hear that cuz you don't live in reality but I'm telling you as a psychologist I'm not going to be able to psychologize all them on the corner some of them going to sleep [ __ ] done and that is just way way way way deeper and significantly more nuanced and requires a lot of depth context and history to truly discuss and unpack than I was prepared to give so the video got scrapped and I started again but then on the heels of publishing my last Eric Adams urina production I didn't want to be perceived as only attacking black politicians because while every black politician I critique is with good reason and honestly not done lightly I don't make a habit of going after politicians regularly in general much less arbitrarily it's still not lost upon me the eagerness with which people rush to eat up critiques of black politicians especially black Democrats or progressives but they drag their feet to engage with critiques of significantly more harmful white politicians especially if they're Republican because look I have a scathing documentary on Eric Adams and I have one on Greg Abbott too but there's a difference in which people flock to I have tons of videos critiquing many different white or republican politicians and they fly under the radar and away from people's interests so as far as the majority of people who don't regularly interact with my content it could appear that I only go after black Democrats and that would be enough for a lot of black people who I mentioned earlier are not as radical or anti- policing as I am to dismiss me as someone who just wants to attack black people who doesn't understand the intricacies of what black people in power are up against who is unrealistic etc etc and I am wary of that so the video got grabbed again but you know when I have a song on my heart I just have to sing it in this case post election I actually don't really have that song on my heart but I already wrote the lyrics okay so even if it takes me a few times to figure out what key I should singing in y'all going to hear this tune and what's the key you ask it's the one where I State upfront that there are a lot of black politicians yes even elected officials who are doing some good things to help black and workingclass people to combat Injustice in the criminal system and in every bit of the small ways individuals can help they are helping I'm thinking about Governor West Moore who pardoned 175,000 people who had marijuana related conv and on a local level here in New York I'm thinking of folk like council member Chio who does cool [ __ ] like this we just voted to kill for broker fees in New York City I'm leaving city hall right now where we just passed my bill the Fair Act which requires that whoever hires a broker pays the fee so tenants are done paying fees to Brokers they never wanted nor hired or Congressman Jamal Bowman who not only served as black and brown constituents in the Bronx well but spoke up to rebuke the genocide in Gaza and battled APAC as hard as he could after they successfully spent historic amounts of money to unseat him at the same time there are others who have done some good things for black people in criminal justice while simultaneously doing some maybe even worse things to criminal justice and black people that are in keeping with some of the people who will make this list I haven't quite figured out how to critique this class of leaders I'm thinking of because one there's evidence that maybe their hearts are in the right place that they see themselves as progressives who are on our side and trying and two I don't think I personally know the political landscape they exist within and the history of their communities enough to feel comfortable making any strong condemnations about their character or to question their love and commitment to black people or the communities that they serve they're in limbo political Purgatory if you will wish I'm thinking about the mayor of Birmingham Alabama Randall L Woodfin who is fine respectfully but the Birmingham mayor is an example of who I mean because he has done some good things like pardon 15,000 marijuana convictions and created the pardon for Progress initiative to allow anyone with a misdemeanor conviction from marijuana in Birmingham to apply for a pardon to remove the barriers that come along with the criminal conviction but on the flip side he does things like former crime commission and drop a statement saying [ __ ] like this quote but we're not yet done this investigation continues with the Birmingham Police Department and we will not rest until our streets are safer violent criminals operating with Birmingham will be pursued relentlessly and brought to Justice without delay our commitment to Swift arrest and seamless coordination with local state and federal partners that has been strengthened over the past two years will help ensure that these criminals are prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law ensuring that crime will not continue to thrive in our city violent criminals know that Birmingham Police Department and our fellow law enforcement Partners will be aggressively pursuing we are aggressively getting more police on the streets working on legislation to get automatic weapons off the street and engaging our community in finding innovative ways to deal with violent crime the people in Birmingham are pulling together to win this fight and we will end quote So that obviously doesn't sound like someone poised to rectify the long history of overp policing over incarceration and systemic racial Injustice in Birmingham but at the same time I live in New York City and that's Birmingham Alabama and I am not arrogant enough to assume I understand what kind of political iCal landscape he's working in what he could say and remain in power what he could reasonably get done or what even older black people and voters who definitely do worry about crime and see the traditional system as the only way to address it would think about him if he said some anti- policing type [ __ ] I just don't know so pergatory for him I'm also thinking of the mayor Baltimore Brandon Scott whose stated core values are more aligned with a progressive approach to policing and criminal justice how he described it on his website quote he emerged as a leading voice in reducing violence in Baltimore and reinstated Council oversight of the Baltimore Police Department by holding quarterly hearings he believes that reducing violence will require a holistic all Hands-On deck approach one that recognizes violence is fundamentally a public health issue he led legislative initiatives that created extensive crime data sharing and online reporting of Crimes by Baltimore Police Department in 2016 Scott introduced and passed legislation creating an open data policy in Baltimore end quote but then on the flip side of that he's supporting the building of a $330 million joint trade facility for Baltimore's police and fire departments on West Baltimore's copen State University campus in other words he is supporting the building of a cop City in Baltimore and if you don't know what cop city is we'll talk about that later in the video when we talk about Andre Dickens oh yeah he is not safe but anyway yeah for the mayor Baltimore Purgatory because again Baltimore has a deep history and complicated political and social landscape so I just don't know what that man is navigating or how the people in Baltimore who do what I do in New York City feel about him so I just can't condemn him as a sinner just yet and that's also where I stand on Chicago's mayor Brandon Johnson a progressive that I think has disappointed his supporters in some ways not disappointed them in others and still has some time to do a lot so I want to hold my horses for now because I'm trying to operate with a maturity that considers one that some people maybe want to do the right things but they can't do everything they want to and they're trying to do what they can and two that My Views are not representative of the majority of black people or the majority of voting black people and for these politicians it's probably not strategically sad or an electable position to do or say what I want them to anyway so Purgatory because again I am Reckoning with number two and trying to operate with a spirit of Grace but Grace is not blindness and I can see that some of these mother need to go to hell cuz while some to trying some are moving like the enemy because lesson number one black people can be anti-black Andor do things that are rooted in anti-blackness or specifically and in some cases even intentionally harm the black community sometimes times black people working within systemically racist institutions perpetuate even deeper anti-blackness towards black people than their non-black colleagues as a means of overcompensating for their Blackness black police the white cop and I am tired of these kinds of black characters both Democrat and Republican but I will in this video and generally discuss more the issues with problematic black Democrats than I do black Republicans because while I theoretically like to expect more from black Democrats I absolutely do not expect anything but disappoint coonery and deep shamefulness shamelessness and behavior only worthy of Uncle Ruckus from black Republicans so do not mistake any criticisms of the black Democrats in this video to mean the black Republicans and Republicans in general are anything less than Coons and white supremacists the reason you hear me bothering to discuss and critique these black Democrats is because they're the only ones worth engaging we can do something about them they can be muscled and more importantly the base they serve the council members around them can be muscled and they often are I am not spending my energies talking about black Republicans much because there's no point they're a lost cause like look at this look at this for as obsessed as the media are with race they sure are working hard not to say my name first female elected as lieutenant governor in the comm's history keep your hands off of our Second Amendment rights do you think that you are going to get through to a person like that yeah no and there's also not that many black Republicans in office and they often wield very little power they are mostly inconsequential their only purpose on Earth is to serve as something white Republicans can use as a shield when they're accused of racism like no it's not racist the said it anyhow not the point anyhow I'm getting off topic I've been thinking a lot about problematic black politicians because if you know me I usually spend my time battling New York City's top cop mayor and Mixie con man Eric Adams was probably going to be pardoned by Donald Trump but let whatever but early this year I had turned my attention to Philadelphia's mayor Charelle Parker and DC's mayor Mariel Bowser who are all following in his footsteps in so many ways Lori Lightfoot walks so they could all run but I am not going to kick Lor's back in right now not because I'm compassionate I just rather be focused on politicians who are currently in office wreaking havoc on the black communities that elected them because we need to be aware especially in the case of these anti-black tough on crime black Democrats because they are the most dangerous because many people just assume they're Progressive without further investigation with side tangent is really the problem progresses run into with Democrats in general time and time again we tell folk that politicians aren't who do the work and get things we want done we are but when a Democrat is elected people assume their job is done and they check out until next election season when that's when we really have to start doing the work but black people often just assume black tough on crime Democrats are progressives working in black people's interests and white liberals vote for them precisely because they're not but by being black they get to pay lip service to diversity and insulate themselves from critiques of racism and anti-blackness and being pro police or trying to maintain the status quo it's a conundrum that is whooping our ass I've been talking to cop City activist and thinking about Atlanta specifically in the sense of questioning how we end up with one of the blackest cities in the country with pretty much all black leadership and governance selling itself as a black Mecca meanwhile reality is that though there is a wealthy Elite of black people in Atlanta the wealth disparity between them and the average black atlantan is severe with more than 21.6% of atlantans living in poverty and 31% of Atlanta's children living in poverty and what's that all black leadership doing bending over backwards to police the out of the black people oh my God in fact consider that the underlying theme of this video black people who don't just want to police the [ __ ] out of black people oh no no no they want a literal police state they want to give the police endless control to lock these up F God but why do they want to do it and why are we electing them we could talk forever about this but to get to the answers to those questions the first thing I think we need to do is ask another question and that's who are these black politicians working against our Collective interests or in better words what do they all have in common these are going to be the people who won have capitalized on their Blackness or more specifically the black community's susceptibility to supporting black candidates who present themselves as avatars for black Excellence black success black wealth and black respectability without critically interrogating how commitment to those myths animate their politics and the world they'll shape for other black people who do not and cannot model those things and two people who have offered their Blackness as a shield for white people who don't want to be called racist so they elect black people who promise to more heavily police black people because they believe they can't be called racist beyond a shadow of a doubt if they voted for a black person it's the reason why in the scn and get out when the father meets Daniel gl's character he makes a point to tell him he voted for Obama this is the curse of representation just for representation sake it's the fundamental problem with believing that diversifying racist institutions will fundamentally change the institution when in reality the diverse members are required to more harshly punish their own in order to prove their worth and purpose to the institution that they serve when you consider those two elements it becomes a little easier to identify with skin folk and kin folk not foolproof though that's why we have political Purgatory while we figure it out but for the rest of them Let's Line these Sinners up okay it is time for the seven deadly sins of black politicians let's go I want to start off slow let you get your feet wet so why not start with the sin of being a sloth because what do you associate sloth within your mind slow and I hate to slander poor sloth to animals like this but they're not the brightest bulbs in the lamp but seriously the sin of being a sloth is to be lazy to be slow to fail to utilize your talents to be a good for nothing ass and when I think of a slow good for nothing son of a [ __ ] who failed to live up to their potential well a few people come to mind I was supposed to say Clarence Thomas but as I was writing slow and failed to live up to their potential Ben Carson's face popped up too you all remember Ben Carson I know that's a blast from the past but Ben Carson not to be confused with Herman Kane a mistake I often make did you know that before Ben Carson came out as a trump supporting [ __ ] of a politician he was a respected black neurosurgeon with a black wife unlike many of his fellow black Republicans that may appear in this video who inspired a generation of black doctors and black boys all that black Excellence black people loved to see and then well well when you look at what the black community has been through uh go all the way back to slavery it was the family the strong family units and the faith in God that got people through that they got people through Jim Crow through severe segregation uh through all the difficulties but what really had a negative imp was when the government came along and said dare dare you poor little thing I'm going to take care of all your needs and started implementing policies that were destructive to family formation those are the things that have hurt the black community the most but listen Ben he not even an office no more the person truly guilty of this sin is the black man who replaced the third Good Marshall who started taking gifts and money from Republican billionaire Haren Crow almost immediately after getting on the bench then spent 10 whole ass years in the Supreme Court never speaking like he dead ass did not ask a single question in oral Arguments for a decade and when he did start talking it was to do things like Leafly overturn the right to abortion until tell us he believes the court has a duty to overturn a bunch of other rights it gave us except the right to interracial marriage let's give it up for who a black man who the only time he ever acknowledged he was black or even interested interested in another black person was when he was defending himself for sexually harassing Anita Hill as a black American as far as I'm concerned it is a high tech lynching for up blacks and if you look in the background of that clip you can see his wife jinny Thomas a magga supporter who has several cases related to her involvement in the January 6 interaction dog that's who he's married to and has children with this was the only black representation in the Supreme Court of the United States for more than 20 years Jenny Thomas wife of Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas has been called out again for her advocacy work this time opposing reforms like term limits and ethical codes for the court while left leading Outlets like propublica are all over this reporting on her ties to right-wing think tanks and her influence overc cases her husband rules on you'll notice something interesting on ground news that barely any right leaning Outlets are covering this story at all this is why stepping outside of echo Chambers is so important only following sources that align with your views means missing stories like this or only seeing one side and that's where ground news comes in the app and website that I partner with today by gathering every article they can find reporting on a story ground news makes it easy to spot which angles are emphasized downplayed or ignored depending on where you get your news because not seeing the full picture can have real world implications from shaping public opinion to public policy I personally love using their blind spot feed to find more important stories missing from different media bubbles like Maryland and Delaware sending black women to the senate in a historic verse ground news really cannot be beat they make it so easy for me to make sure that I am not spewing unsubstantiated mess or being biased and trifling Plus in this particular climate where everyone's targeting you with clickbait and misinformation and it's hard to tell what's real

video and while I'm talking about this sloth just listen to this dodo bird hersel Walker people want to ask me all the time why I'm running I'm sick and tired I'm sick and tired of didn't want to teach CTR in in school I I tell you something else I heard and I think about this cuz at one time science said man came from AES did it not every time I read or hear that I think to myself you just didn't read the same Bible I did well well this what's interesting though if that is true why are there still Apes think about it you know now you're get getting too smart for us no no no no thing about this we have a Evolution that is we've gotten so intelligent that if that is true why is there still AES and then the conception of a baby let me tell you science can't do that they still trying to do it we in America have some the cleanest air and cleanest water of anybody in the world so what we do is we going to put from the Green New Deal millions of billions of dollar cleaning our good air up so all of a sudden China and India ain't putting nothing in that cleaning that situation up so all that bad a still there but since we don't control the air our good air decided to float over to China bad air so when China gets all good air that bad air got to move and Hershel Walker has also committed the sin of lust seeing as he had all kind of love children popping up in the middle of his campaign child stories for you tonight one day after admitting to having fathered a second son Georgia US Senate candidate Hershel Walker now says that he's the father of another son as well as a daughter until earlier this week Walker had only publicly mentioned his 22-year-old son Christian Walker well this morning news broke of a third son out of wedlock who is now 13 years old and now an adult daughter who was born when he was the running back star for the University of Georgia oh God oh God now the sin of lust lust is the strong desire for something but it doesn't have to be on its face that's not necessarily a bad thing but when it's a politician with a Lust For more and more power it can be truly dangerous this is a sin so so many politicians are guilty of so many on this list are guilty of but a few really stand out to me a lot of black Republicans are simply mouthpieces for white supremacy who accomplish very little and wield little power or leave office without ever entering the public zit guys or our Consciousness While others take cooning to a level that is not just about having an inferiority complex and wanting to be validated by the whites but about deeply hating black people and that former Kentucky attorney general Daniel Cameron the bastard that refused to charge the officers who brutally murdered 26-year-old bana Taylor who'd been sleeping in her bed before idiot murderous plain clothed police officers broke into her home and shot her to death then arrested her fiance for trying to protect him and his fiance but it's not just that he didn't charge the offices for murdering Banna Taylor it's also that he did charge one of the officers not for murdering Banna but for wanting endangerment by shooting into the neighbor's apartment and that man Daniel Cameron did all that clamoring for power to gear himself up for a run for governor only to still lose loser [ __ ] second up is DC's mayor Muriel Bowser who lust for power and control had her introducing one of the most Draconian ass expansions of police power I've personally ever seen this woman is responsible for what I call the DC crime bill yeah 30 years after the 1994 crime Bill caused the mass incarceration of countless black people this black woman introduced a law that would give police so much unchecked power in the most expansive reading of the DC crime bill it gave the police the power to one designate any neighborhood they want a high-risk area and once done they can stop search or arrest anyone walking with so much as a single other person two arrest anyone wearing any kind of face covering at the sole discretion of the police three demand anyone riding the Metro provide the police with their name and address or face arrest four legally kill suspects during car chases five to allow police to review their body camera footage before writing their statements that's suspicious six it made it a crime to discard a gun it made it so it becomes a separate crime the moment the gun touches the ground I say separate crime because follow along illegal gun possession is already a crime so if someone possessed the gun illegally they could and would already be being prosecuted for that what this provision did was add a criminal charge if you decide to discard or drop a gun when being confronted by the police this is one of the worst Provisions in the law because it doesn't take too much imagining to realize how deadly the consequences would be in a country where police have repeatedly killed black people under the stated justification that they so much just thought they were armed whether legally or not so imagine what happens when this law disincentivizes people to put their gun down because this makes it another crime which is a problem in a nation where keeping the gun on you is all the police need to justify giving you a death sentence they need only say they fired because you were armed and I want to remind you these are just but a handful of Provisions from this horrific law the law is much much worse and expansive than this among other things the DC crime Bill also cut funding for SNAP food stamps it cut funding for homeless prevention and eviction support it cut funding for emergency rental assist it cut funding for transitional support from shelter programs youth re-entry diversion programs and domestic violence support and do you want to hear some of the [ __ ] she had in the law before Advocate successfully pushed back on it if she had her way the law would have also prohibited the public from knowing if an officer who was found guilty of misconduct is still on active duty or not dog why do you think that is think about it if she had it her way the law would have not only let cops review their body camera footage before they write their statements but also it would have had their status concealed from the public if they had committed police misconduct before that's not suspicious dog I'm on TOA but back to lusting for power because Eric Adams has been lusting for power since he was a kid if you watch my Eric Adams the worst mayor in America video you already know this but Eric Adams became a cop precisely because he wanted power he was in a gang hidden licks and after the police arrested him and beat the dog [ __ ] out of him when he was 14 years old instead of hating the cops this decided that the police were who really run tangs he said these have the juice I'm going to go do that so he left one gang to join the biggest gang in America the NYPD mind you did you know the NYPD is more than 35,000 police officers yeah for this one city we have got more police officers in this city than some countries have in their militaries anyway that lust for power is what made Eric Adams become a police and it's precisely what made him put NYPD on his back Eric Adams is seeing to it that he and the NYPD are unstoppable and you know how you become Unstoppable by keeping the public in the dark about what you're doing so they don't feel compelled to rise up against you which is precisely why when the block got hop for Eric Adams about the mounting deaths of people awaiting trial at Rikers he decided to have the Department of Correction stop letting the public know about the deaths altogether you can't receive public outrage if the public doesn't know what they should be outraged about and that's not the extent of how far he'd take it he hired thousands more NYPD officers he gave them the biggest deal they've ever seen and wait for this brought back stop and frisk despite running on ads targeted towards the black community about how he experienced police brutality as a Tean and became a cop to fight against it Adams could not wait to bring stop and frisk back which was found unconstitutional in 2011 because of nypd's racist use against Black and Hispanic people but it's worse now under a black ass mayor Eric Adams than even during the Bloomberg era NYPD has stopped tens of thousands of people since Adams took over and 97% of the people stopped have been Black Or Hispanic and worse than that Adams is not only overseen nypd's use of stopping Frisk he he specifically revived and rebranded an NYPD unit that had been disbanded for their disproportionate number of police shootings of black people in 2020 and it's those units that he rebranded in order to carry out stop and frisk ain't that some [ __ ] and where there's a lust for power there's usually an envious mother hoping to take a page out of that book let's talk Envy in New York City Eric Adams already brought back stop and frisk but next door in Philadelphia their first woman mayor Charelle Parker is hoping to do the same shorty loves the police and she let that be known right under the gate the night she was elected she told the city of Philadelphia upfront she was going to be hiring hundreds of cops implementing stop and frisk and getting to work on locking everybody asses up shorty wants to use the police to stop and search people in such a way that even the Republican she was running against said it wasn't possible to have officers do what she wanted without violating people's rights and please know as soon as she got into office office she got right to Banning and criminalizing ski masks and expanding the police force which is why it should come as no shock that Philadelphia Police murdered 28-year-old Alexander Spencer while stopping and frisking him but let's leave Philly and bounce back to my beloved New York city so we can discuss greed should not Shock you that Eric Adams makes this list again what can I say I can't help it his greediness is precisely exact actly why he's been federally indicted for illegal Kickbacks straw donor schemes illegally misappropriating $10 million and public funds for his own campaign taking Brad trips and doing favors for Turkish government officials it's why his entire fing Administration is resigned because they were all out here doing dirt trying to make sure quote Everybody Eats as one of them put it watch my second Eric Adams video the end of Eric Adams to get deep in the weeds but if you watch my first Eric Adams video you already knew knew this greedy thie been lons at IRS from time there is a popular widespread belief that Eric Adams lives in New Jersey even though he now insists he lives in Brooklyn because he needs to live in New York City in order to be New York city mayor go figure why does that matter in terms of his greed well it's that line that got his greedy ass caught up a IRS see Eric Adams had bought a bedy apartment building from the federal government when he was an NYPD Captain M for just $361,000 m and that didn't pay taxes in 2017 2018 or 2019 on any rental income he collected from his tenants and he reported to the IRS that he spent just enough on repairs to the building to write off the entire amount he collects in rent this and he also reported that he did not live in the Brooklyn apartment building he now claims he resides in because property owners are allowed to write off their expenses on rental units not residential units they live in so it's either he doesn't live in Brooklyn for real at which point he's lying now or he does live in in Brooklyn at which point he was lying then either way he was lying to IRS to avoid paying what he owed Eric Adams dodging paying his taxes meanwhile New York has spent $14.5 million of our tax Bay dollars to cover nypd's police misconduct settlements which is nearly double what we paid in 2020 before Eric Adams became mayor but we not done with greeting New York just yet Richie Torres bring that ass here boy if you don't know Richie Torres he's a bronx Congressman now now Richie is many things he's a congressman he's black he's Latino he's queer but Above All Else he's in deep in apac's Pocket okay that mother goes up for Israel okay you don't know not ner a Zionist or Jewish man fighting for Israel like Richie Torres fights for Israel and that's because APAC is that top campaign contributor and it's not close either and that's greed and that greed his need for APAC money has him out here like ceasefire throw and protesting college students the out from the river to the sea I lock you terrorist [ __ ] up that mother does not play about Israel I tell you and he will tweet you into Oblivion about it and block your ass with the mother quickness child anyway I don't know about y'all but when I think about greed I also think [Music] about when I think of greed I think about gluttony but on crack I think that's the only way to describe the level of black people selling out black people going on in Atlanta because the greater problem is that while Atlanta masquerades as a kind of black Mecca the reality just does not quite add up and it hasn't added up for a while in Atlanta they it's referred to as the Atlanta way a lot of cool Scholars have sort of like fleshed out this concept you know throughout the last century of how the Atlanta way works and it really is sort of like this strategic partnership between black political leadership and then white economic leadership where they really work hand inand of course you know just for the upper class Elites and at the cost of you know especially Atlanta's black residents Atlanta in the last you know couple decades has gone from a majority black City to now black folks comprise less than 50% of the City's population because of all of these policies you know it's such a sort of Ground Zero for major development really rapid development um the Olympics in the 9s they tore down a bunch of public housing they passed a bunch of new anti-homelessness laws like really sort of explicitly racist things were happening activists found that basically before like big events in the Olympics police were going around with these pre-printed tickets that had on them African-American male homeless and just rounding them up and throwing them in the jail is that what you all end up with I recently heard about like the Red Dogs yeah this sort of like notorious police unit that was like disbanded after you know a bunch of you know horrible high-profile incidents but then like sort of been you know as a lot of these units do they often get you know sort of they new life with different games you know yeah and that brings us to today there's a gentleman named Bill torpy who is a um an opinion columnist at the AJC and I can't remember which of his pieces this was but he often falls back on the line that like hey this is this is a black mayor and multiple black city council members who came to this decision therefore like like you can't say anything about it and he is um and that's yeah there's a lot of falling behind um sort of the myth of the black Mecca here and I again I feel like that's starting to unravel finally yeah remember I mentioned the cop city they're trying to build in Baltimore well where does all this cop City Madness begin well people already familiar with the stop cop City movement might assume the answer is Atlanta but it's not Atlanta's wasn't even the first the first you know in 2017 Chicago started working to build cop Academy um which has this sort of similar compound nature to it you know this mock Village in order to train um and so cop City followed Chicago's cop Academy and now you know there's proposals sprouting up all over the place all over the country rural urban you know huge one proposed in Baltimore um you know it's they're they're really all over the place the plans you know are not just to train you know a city's police force it's also to train with each other and that's domestic and International I mean the the connections are everywhere um you know in in in Israel there's a training facility that they refer to as mini Gaza that has existed for years you know it's just like this is it's all over the place exactly because they're learning they're learning the tactics that they want to use on those particular people like and that's right that's the most obvious part about where it's popping up Atlanta Chicago Baltimore where you're hearing this you know they're not trying to do it in [ __ ] West Virginia's backyard right right and and you know in the same way that you know they call Palestinians terrorists they're calling Atlanta activists terrorists you know it's all it's it's this you know frame of you know once you call someone a terrorist you can do anything you want to them and you know I think pop city is is part of that plan domestically and internationally so what is cop City so cop city is the name given to a proposed um Training Center that has been known to the public now in Atlanta since about spring summer of 2021 um it was met with immediate uh Fierce opposition from a really really diverse group of folks throughout Atlanta and since then um it's been an incredible story of um resistance from the people and repression from the state and the city um where we're at right now is a protester has been murdered um there are 61 over 60 people in this massive RICO case um something like 40 of them have domestic terrorism charges um it's you know there have been multiple militarized SWAT style raids on activists homes including some very recently it's pretty scary and like you said this is it seems like a local issue but this is deeply a national issue um I just saw a really good I forget who put this together if I figure it out I'll shout them out but um research that shows there are three states in the entire country that are not thinking about or in the process of creating something like cop City in Atlanta I think the states that are not building it is Vermont shout out to Vermont that's where I'm from uh I want to say Nebraska and West Virginia which I should say very very white States all of the states not building them are in like the top five whitest states in the country God I guess let's go back to 2020 because that's what they're trying to do so in the indictment this like massive sprawling very strange document that just kind of like seeks to criminalize like leftist organizing that's basically what the RICO does they connect the start of the stop cop City movement to the uprisings in 2020 you know in Atlanta a gentleman named rard Brooks was napping off a couple of drinks at a Wendy's he was murdered by Atlanta police there was like massive uprisings tons of folks in the streets um you know demanding that Atlanta police be be defunded very similar to the messaging that we saw across the country and it kind of feels like this is a direct response to that which is to say the most oppositional response you could get from a bunch of people asking for Less police funding you know to start this incredibly expensive um dangerous project against um huge opposition so you know there are folks on the ground here who um still want to support the Atlanta way which I would say is a real like black white Coalition Pro business very like Pro capitalism Atlanta's a big business City in a big business State I think the sort of powers that be whether that's folks who are elected or Business Leaders are trying to say to developers and other people who might see Atlanta as a place to make money go ahead you're good you know this thing happened in 2020 but don't worry we're not going to let that happen again in this massive militarized facility that we're building in the middle of a for us is going to help ensure that that doesn't happen and while the current mayor Andre Dickens has become sort of the face of the cop City problem it didn't start with him how did this start I mean we are now on year like three oh no my math is rough um of of this movement so it was back in the spring um of 2021 sort of following the 2020 uprisings there was this you know massive sort of backlash frontlash from you know a lot of sort of like Atlanta's Elite ruling class actors um you know the area of Buckhead is this really white wealthy part of the city a lot of corporations are based there you know they all freaked out about you know the protests the cops you know freaked out they started calling out sick they were you know doing this blue flu form of protest um you know so all all these powerful institutions are like seeing that people are in the streets they're you know breaking windows they're burning cop cars they're like really rising up against the status quo um and of course know these these institutions were not having it and so early early 2021 the ad mayor kha Lance bottoms um announces that they're going to be turning this um you know almost 400 acre plot of land in Southeast Atlanta just outside City Limits um into this massive you know they call it a police training facility we call it cop city um because it literally you know part of the plans for cop City include a mock City with all of these like Pretend City buildings in which you know they're going to be practicing all forms of you know Urban Warfare militarized tactics um and so that was sort of the starting point it was the mayor announcing it um but it was also um you know all of these corporations immediately releasing statements through these various you know public private Partnerships that they have supporting it um and saying you know we're we're fully behind this we're going to fund raise for it you know whatever the Like Chief Architect of the plan was the Atlanta Atlanta police foundation um which is this you know private nonprofit um police foundation that rakes in enormous amounts of money from various corporations many of which are based in Atlanta um and then in turn you know pumps a lot of that money into policing buys a lot of real estate provides um housing for cops um they run the city's surveillance Network Atlanta is one of the most surveilled cities in the world um and so they really have their hands in like all things policing in Atlanta um and they were the ones who really like designed this plan so that that's that's the start of it and the problem doesn't start and end with atlantis's black mayor many of their black politicians are in on it throughout this there have been a bunch of votes the initial vote was are we going to lease the land to the police foundation to build cop City and then there were a couple different votes on the actual funding for cop City at each stage there's 15 council members at each stage there's been four no votes um there's one council member who's like been pretty vocally opposed some often um the rest have really not said much at all I mean the level of like support from any leg ative body whether it's city council state government is basically zero and then you know I mean to to your point about you know the makeup of the council it is you know a majority black city council and part of what gives it so much coverage is like one of the main council members in favor of cop city is Michael Julian Bond the son of the you know the famous Civil Rights activist Julian Bond and he uses his dad all the time you know to justify his votes in favor of more policing keeping the jail open you know all all all of these things and so like Atlanta also really uses its like civil rights history Liliana bakari District 5 um has has pretty regularly spoken out against cop city um you know I think that Liliana is really the the only one who has been outspoken in any way which I think sometimes leads to not saying as much because then there's a lot of backlash um I would say there's no true champion on on the city council but while the politicians may not be opposing cop City the people of Atlanta are but the elites just don't give a I've seen a huge shift in Atlanta and I think it's really like radiated beyond the city as well you know the referendum attempt this summer got over 100,000 signatures that's like more than a fifth of the city but the elites who gave them the ability to do the referendum and be heard clearly never anticipated the referendum to stop cop City would be successful so they started trying to fight the referendum in court which is important because it's not the first or only way the people have resisted cop City in Atlanta the other protest of resulted in Atlanta police straight up murdering a protester 26-year-old Torita the autopsy revealed what other protesters and Witnesses said from the jump that Torita literally had their hands up don't shoot but that did not stop the police from shooting them 57 times the police claimed that Torita refused to come out of their tent in the forest and that Torita shot at the officers wounding one first before police decided to riddle them with bullets however the coroner said the autopsy did not reveal any gunpowder on tor need his hands to support them having ever held or fired a gun just 57 bullet holes showing the police sure did although police claims their investigators later found particles consistent with gunpowder residue sure although police claimed torig shot at and wounded an officer before police decided to kill them a responding officer was actually heard on radio during the incident stated quote you your own officer up so people believe the officers actually shot their own officer by mistake while they were shooting at torig and does it shock you to learn that the Atlanta da did not charge the officers they said that it was quote objectively reasonable to riddle this 26-year-old climate activists with bullets and it's not just this murder Atlanta officials generally abuse Rico charges and overp policing their own so it should be no surprise how else they've responded to the cop City protesters which is what makes it so important that Atlanta officials also ignored the referendum because they use the law what some would say is the right way to do things there are 61 over 60 people in this massive RICO case um something like 40 of them have domestic terrorism charges it's you know there have been multiple militarized SWAT style raids on activists homes including some very recently it's pretty scary and like you said this is it seems like a local issue but this is deeply a national issue the referendum that I just mentioned was this very cool attempt last summer um to make this like a direct democracy thing and actually put the issue of cop City on the ballot in Atlanta that's a really interesting example I think one of the most radicalizing things about this movement has been how clearly it shows people even when the state tells you there's an acceptable way to protest and you're not doing it the right way but if you just did it this way things would happen have like years now of seeing just people get gas lit by the state you know and the referendum feels like one of those things like you know go vote or some sort of platonic like this doesn't actually mean anything and people were like okay what's also interesting is where they're building cop City it's it's just like anti-democratic through and through and through and I mean this land was of course you know originally Mogi Creek land you know they were violently dispossessed of this land then for like almost a hundred years it was used as a prison farm where people incarcerated by the city were forced to work on behalf of the city um and now it's they're trying to turn it into cop city after you've seen how black Atlanta officials give it up as it pertains to the sin of gluttony and their overuse of Rico and violent supported the police state it shouldn't surprise anyone that for the sin of Wrath we're staying in [Music] Atlanta if you expected Atlanta district attorney Fanny Willis to pop up when we talked about lust because of her affair with Nathan Wade the prosecutor she gave the Trump case to you're losing the plot a bit you are losing the plot there are too many legitimate serious criticisms of her for me to get involved with low brow Mis serin War to put a lot more sauce on her relationship with that PR utor than anyone would have ever put on it had she been a man I'm sorry what I want to talk about is who she is as a prosecutor which speaks to my fundamental issues with any celebrations of prosecutors or the continued elevation of them as Progressive Champions because the reality is at its core what prosecutors do is jail okay and those who try to truly be Progressive the Chas of Bin of the world get pushed out by media campaigns that were designed to vilify them and blame them for manufactured crime waves and to disappear as soon as they've been replaced with the status quo it's why I've said in multiple videos that although I undoubtedly wanted kamla Harris to beat Donald Trump and we are all going to regret that she didn't I was always weary about the long-term impact that would have been had on the black community especially little black girls would have grown up idolizing the first black woman president who would have been a prosecutor we would have been guaranteed at least another generation of black people invested in the idea that they can be a progressive prosecutor or worse they wouldn't even want to be a progressive prosecutor they think that the black community needs to solve issues brought about by Decades of intentional under investment and overcriminalization with more prison and they not only think that they would do it with a Vengeance and it's that Vengeance that wrath that had Fanny Willis out here using Rico charges to prosecute and jail 12 black teachers for allegedly changing children's test scores so they wouldn't get left behind in a school system that has been starved the average third grader in Atlanta isn't even reading at grade school level but instead of recognizing that the school systems need resources that teachers are underwater that there's a lot going on that motivated what happened Fanny Willis went out of her way to not just criminalize these teachers she used Reco charges and pushed for the harshest sentences possible in a world where those black teachers could have been punished by losing their license or maybe have been assisted by giv resources and support Fanny said jail and I'd argue she's guilty of the sin of Pride as well because there was an outcry of critics and people begging her not to do what she was doing and her response was quote so if what I am being criticized for is doing something to protect people that did not have a voice for themselves I sit in that criticism and y'all can put it in my obituary end quote truthfully every politician we've discussed is guilty of this sin so I figure why not end this video with this Jam we cannot only worship Gandhi we must practice Gandhi so I'm Gandhi like I think like Gandhi I act like Gandhi I want to be like Gandhi I wanted to be the modern day ramayana and say that we can lead against the forces of evil and take us to the next Direction

have played out the way it did I wouldn't have wrote this [ __ ] okay because I'm not in a spirit to to be on black politicians ass even the bad ones like I'm done I'm I'm exhausted I'm sure yall are
