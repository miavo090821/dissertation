Rabia is a chill, but she is not stupid and wouldn’t make up that they have more evidence and that someone should be arrested by the end of the year.  Why don’t you just wait? Your confidence is scary, because I imagine you would have shut down this case long ago and maybe have an innocent person behind bars. Our justice system is designed to have  10 innocent people getting away with crime, rather than one innocent person being falsely jailed. So your confidence here and unwillingness to just wait and allow for any doubt in your mind is scary. Really really scary. I think Adnan is somewhere between 60-70% innocent, I have room to believe he is guilty. But the investigation is open and active, we will have to see if it leads back to Adnan. But again Rabia wouldn’t lie about what she said a few weeks ago. Arrest by end of year.",

In the note his buddies wrote all over the back their plans on harassing Hae Min by asking her sexual questions and implying that Adnan got her pregnant to force her back to him. He never defends Has Min from those sexual questions or bats an eye at her feeling disrespected. Because he never respected her. He always viewed Hae as his property because that's what his mosk taught him to do. The prosecution even brought up the fact that Pakistani men would often flee the states or Pakistan to avoid being prosecuted for honor killings. Women and girls are horrifically overrepresented in honor killings and one of the triggers for honor killing is rejection of proposals by a woman. Adnan was raised in a culture that told him if a woman ever rejected him he had the divine right to kill her where she stood and that he would be respected in his community for doing so...And which community stepped in, willing to lie about where Adnan was the day of the murder? The local Muslim community at the time...Those people don't respect women. They act nice and placated and innocent but in reality they don't respect anyone or anything but their own egos.\n\nHae Min Lee was not only killed by Adnan Syed but by  his disgusting culture that vindicated his revolting actions that day.",

Easy to manipulate by specially foreign criminal call out injustice some foreign men see the white women as easy meat. Adnan syed killed Hae min lee out of rejection and jealousy threatened to kill her in the letter   she sent him and he carried out his evil plan and killed Hae min lee by strangling her. Strangulation is a heinous crime l'm sure Hae min lee beg for her life. What l find disturbing is Jay wild help Adnan syed disspose of Hae min lee body l believe Jay wild is telling the truth he should have told Adnan syed to get one of your Pakistani friends to help you disspose of Hae min lee body Jay should have gone to the police. Jay wild personally knew Hae min lee and said that she was nice l have often thought about this Jay wild is evil he personally knew Hae min lee. But instead he help Adnan syed disspose of Hae min lee body. Lauren Dal You made no condolences or sympathy to Hae min lee family.  My thoughts go's out to Hae min lee family 👪.",

People's of the Arabian peninsula was not interested with the jews and their pagan built on semerians creation mytholog zoroastrian and other pagan religions. Jews have done identity theft from these pagan religions. People of the Arabian peninsula was not interested with the jews and their pagan religion. They had their own pagan religion. Only when Muhammad comes along with his so call  vision of the Angel Gabriel later on the people's of the Arabian peninsula join pagan zionist god club  no one never witness Muhammad talking to and the Angel Gabriel never told people that Muhammad was a prophet to witness this and never mention nothing about Muslim. No pagan jewish imaginary been god of Israel Yahweh never existed yahweh is the name of a sumerian pagan god 4000 years BCE before the jews ever existed and copy the name yahweh or Allah to zionist Muslim you believe in a Jewish imaginary been who never existed.

There was nothing here and European whites built the country. Other races coming here and filing for social service benefits is the polar opposite of that. Every other race can have \"pride\". Whites say they have pride and they are deemed racist. It's unfucking believable what bullshit white guilt has done to people. Whites should be proud. More proud than anybody. They've accomplished more than any other race ever despite being less than 10% if the earth's population and what do other races do? They bitch about whites and blame them for their own shortcomings.

        "text": "@clem.3894 Sorry but that’s just plain wrong. First of all, let’s please not bring in the idea that Adnan actually has a religious footing in anything that he did. That’s absurd. By already having a girlfriend/secret lover outside of marriage in the first place, he was already clearly breaking one of Islam’s important injunctions. So to act according to that “sin” in any way is already invalid & wrong by default. This guy was just a homy & jealous immature imp who lacked any self-control. To suggest that he acted out of religion is grossly short-sighted & missing the entire point. So to quote the Qur’an itself on this:\n\n*”Are you really going to believe in one part of the Law, but then disbelieve in another? What can be the repayment for such people among you who do that, other than humiliation in this life? **_[i.e what Adnan presumably got]_** And on the Day of Resurrection, they will be subjected to the most severe torment. And God is not unaware of anything that you do!”* _(Qur’an 2:85)_\n\nNow as to your actual claim about the Qur’an, you are simply incorrect. First of all, the word “fasād” in Arabic (فساد) literally means _”a state of disorder, destruction, annihilation, consumption, waste, or ruin” (Lane’s Arabic Lexicon)_ It is the exact same word the Qur’an uses to describe how the universe would “be destroyed” or “fall into utter chaos & ruin” if there were actually more than one god (thus why monotheism makes sense).\n\nSo in context of Qur’an 5:32 (the passage at hand), it clearly refers to violence, evil, destruction or terror that might not “take a life” per say, as the preceding phrase mentions, but nevertheless would be deserving of capital punishment (and hence the exceptions made). In other words, the Qur’an here is saying that all life is sacred and off-limits from taking—but to remove any ambiguity or confusion (since it also teaches equal justice & not pacifism), the two qualifications are made—namely that if someone murders, you may justifiably take their life as you would in any governed society & court; and likewise, if they spread violence & chaos such as highway robbery, r***, torture, war-mongering, etc.—even if such things may not end any lives per day, they can still be punished with capital penalty, and not incur the massive sin that is being outlined for those who “take an innocent life.”\n\nSo it certainly has nothing to do with mere “sinning” or “indecency.” In fact, that is why you seem to have missed that the phrase in the original text is precisely worded as *”those who do ‘fasād’ ON EARTH”* which is specifying that this is large-scale crime against humanity or society, which harms and damages the entire land, rather than just being a personal or ‘localized’ sin such as mere ‘indecency’ (which has its own unique words in Arabic).\n\nMoreover, this is further solidified by examining other examples of the word ‘fasād’ in this formula throughout the Qur’an. Early on in just the second chapter of the Qur’an, we already have a CLEAR description (arguably even a definition) of the word “fasād” in the following verse, which clearly has to do with spreading physical chaos & violence, rather than mere “indecency” or small-scale wrongs:\n\n*”When such a person gains power, he strives to spread corruption (fasād) on earth **_[note the exact same epithet here as Sūrah_** **5:32**]— *BY DESTROYING PROPERTIES AND LIVES.* But God does not like violence & chaos [fasād]!” _(Qur’an 2:205)_\n\nThere you have it—clear as day. The word “innocent” in my earlier translation above was actually just my own summary of those two qualifications of Qur’an for taking life (namely murder & violence), which I merely condensed into “innocence” for the sake of ease & summarization. So I didn’t “miss” anything. Though I’m afraid you did. But no worries. I appreciate that you gave me the chance to clarify this point.\n\n*P.S.* It’s notable to mention that this passage (Qur’an 5:32) starts by actually stating that this Law (the sanctity of life) was actually originally revealed by God to the Children of Israel (and being re-established here), as an eternal lesson taught to humanity from the Cain & Abel story (which had just been narrated by the Qur’an in the immediately preceding passage)—and what’s interesting is that there has actually a debate raging debating among the scholarly Jewish community as to the actual original rendering of the Talmudic/Rabbinic maxim that states this sanctity of life.\n\nSome Jewish versions have it: *”Whoever destroys a single life IN ISRAEL is considered by Scripture to have destroyed the whole world”*\n\n…While others omit the “in Israel” and leave it open & generic. Well among others, a Jewish believer & writer of the famous Jewish column _”Philologos”_ (now _’Mosaic’)_ actually argues that the Qur’an PRESERVES the original rendering, which is a generic, open-ended, unrestricted & universal condemnation of taking of life, that is not bound by faith, culture, ethnicity, or national ties. So even Jewish people (the original audience of this moral lesson) are interestingly relying on sources like the Qur’an itself to support their belief in the universalism of this divine injunction. Just thought I would point that out for what it’s worth.\n\nPeace.",

I'm just saying that the religious motivation of sin leading to corruption and thus needing to extinguish the source of that sin is the main problem here that shouldn't be ignored in any context.\n\nThis exception of capital punishment which you mention renders the point null, though, especially for people like apostates or adulterers etc.? That in itself disproves the sanctity of life.\n\n “Waging war against Allah and His Messenger” does not only mean those who bear arms and attack Muslims. In common Islamic terms, this also stands for those who oppose and ideologically fight Islam. Ibn Kathir on 5:33 says: \n\n“‘Wage war’ mentioned here means; oppose and contradict, and it includes; disbelief, blocking roads, and spreading fear in the fairways”.\n\nThe second reason given is “corruption”, which is essentially “spreading Islamically unlawful acts in the land”. \n\nMeaning doing everything that is outlawed in Islam. Ibn Kathir on 5:33 says “Mischief in the land refers to various types of evil”. \n\nAnd I mean, yeah 5:32 isn’t to tell Muslims killing someone is like killing all humankind, what it does is assert that God told the Israelites that this was a rule and they became transgressors after.\n\nFasad, in an Islamic context, can refer to spreading corruption on Earth or spreading mischief in a Muslim land, moral corruption against God, or disturbance of the public peace.\n\nClassical Quranic commentators commonly interpreted \"corruption in the land\" as open disobedience against God or its result. In certain contexts, classical jurists took it to refer to the legal category of Hirabah, comprising armed assault, rape and murder. Some contemporary Muslims view destruction of the natural environment to be among the central meanings of verses referring to fasad.\n\nAll of the above can subsequently be true. They're not mutually exclusive. And that isn't even to say all Muslims believe such things, obviously you and many others do not. But to act like these teachings don't have any sort of material harm is wishful thinking.",

The reason he should not be deemed not guilty- is because victims who are deemed not guilty of a crime are entitled to monetary compensation to the tune of three million dollars.  NO WAY does this shameless man deserve compensation for murder.  That's why it's important.  What's more- the family deserves that.  The community deserves that.  If he supposedly didn't do it- then finger pointing is un-necessary and will never lead to \"finding the real killer\" because Adnan did it.  Notice how cool and calm he was in prison. No innocent person would take it in stride.  They'd be crying and saying that it wasn't fair.  They'd be angry and want to find the actual killer.  That's absent because Adnan is the killer.  He probably cringes when Rabia writes about this case, and goes on and on about her \"baby brother\" who could never have done this.  Yes Rabia- people do kill and commit crimes of passion.",

We’re supposed to take seriously that Adnan Syed carried out a well thought-out, premeditated murder, sanitized all crime scenes including: his own car, his own clothes and shoes, even his entire house they examined for soil samples, Hae’s body, Hae’s clothes on her body, Hae’s car, Hae’s belongings in her car, the shovels from Jay’s relatives and basically left not a single trace of physical evidence to implicate him in the murder but somehow this criminal mastermind just forgot to come up with a credible alibi. And at a time when crime shows were only aired at 10pm and google was only 5 months-old (but he didn’t even have a computer at home). An almost perfect crime all by a 17 year-old, no less! Not to mention, he was threatened with the death penalty if he didn’t admit to the murder and was later found guilty. Adnan didn’t budge and maintained his innocence. A kid with no criminal history and in a program at school most people might consider nerdy. But Jay, on the other hand, a considered criminal caved in and “confessed”.",

All we have is her voice, her words and the words of adnan. That is a lot of trust that I don't think she earned.. but if you space out the episodes by a week, and stay engaged with her social media etc  there feels like a mutual bond is being cultivated. She dumbs herself down and tries to sound relatable.. it works. She also takes advantage of the time lapaed between episodes.. things that immediately stood out as complete contradictions she's made or flat out lies.  Some trivial lies and some more meaningful lies. But very subtle that I can imagine I'd miss if it wasn't for the fact that I just listened to episode 3, two hours ago,  opposed to 2 weeks ago.. does that make sense?",

Initially, I would not even be able to say that with conviction because when I first stumbled this case I was only 70%  to 80% leaning it was Adnan but after going through so many videos, articles, and podcasts and focusing on the timeline of that day and the investigation proceedings, everything just comes back to Adnan. Even after considering all the speculations/theories that these podcasts use, it could not even prove he is innocent. This is so horrible for Hae's family and a justice system that can be just bent and overturned based on speculation and politics even though there are all the damning evidence and arguments/motive. Just because the DNA of the killer is not present on the body already exposed to elements for one month doesn't mean the murderer can be acquitted of the crime. As Hae's younger brother said, this is not just a podcast for them, this is their life. Everyone who capitalizes on painting Adnan as the victim just totally lost the plot, this case is about finding the killer of Lee Hae Min not making the state apoligize because somehow everything, everyone spent all the crazy efforts just to frame a muslim guy in 1999 who has he motive and access to harm Hae Min. Everything looks bad against him for a reason and that is because he is guilty.",

For example, in one of the trials, there were two different people where Adnan was going around boasting that Hae wanted to get back together with him.  However, he didn't know at the time that Hae wrote in her diary either on the day of her murder or the day before how much she loved her new boyfriend and thought he was her soulmate.  Adnan made those claims because he knew Hae wouldn't be back to dispute his lies.  Adnan has had many, many different stories over time.  First, he tells police that he asked for a ride and then was busy so he never showed.  Then, he said that he was working on his car in the school parking lot with a friend.  Then, he says he was actually with Jay Wilds but was also at the mosque with 80 people who won't testify for him.  This is speculation, but I suspect when Adnan called Hae with his phone number, she told him that she was on the phone with her new boyfriend and had to go.  This probably enraged Adnan, he gave her one last option to change her mind about him, and he decided to go ahead with his plan.",

Serial did a stellar job doing this. Entertaining? Sure! But carefully deceptive and certainly not investigative journalism. The WM3 committing those crimes to those 3 boys they had no connection to is comical to say he least. it's just playing into the moral panid and propaganda of the time  involving satantic death cults and devil sex orgies! these dudes were just awkward misfits in high school that were dabbling in a bit of counter culture / teen angst! The cops botched it big time and they know it hence why they gave them the alford plea. P.s the evidence that exonerated them was a hair follicle consistent with the dna of one of the step fathers who was originally overlooked from the beginning. The significance of the follicle was that it was found tied into the knots used to bind one of the victims. There was another follicle found on the rope that was a match to a friend of this same step father in question. May i remind you that no dna evidence has been linked to the wm3 to this day. Explain that? Do you think amanda knox is guilty too?",

In fact, she said she's gone through it now 3 times since deciding to really do a deep dive into researching, but that she's also sourced as much as she could find throughout her research. She even gave disclaimers at the beginning saying she knew well of the podcast as well as the book Adnan's Story, written with a bias, and she recognizes the bias as well as how it might have initially clouded her original judgement. It seems to me she made that disclaimer because her deep dive has altered her previous thoughts. I think it's fair to see where these episodes go before interjecting this early on, because knowing the previous work both she and the 2 of them do together, she's very robust in using as many legitimate resources as possible for her research. I can get where her initial statement might have come across that way to you, but I re-listened to it and I feel like she's eluding to her recent deep dive leading away from the podcast. Just my take on what I heard 😊.",

Try thinking a girl family memebr or friend of yours was killed and you all just want to find justice for her murder. Just for once, try not to focus on the narrative that somehow everything and everyone went out of their way to frame and point to the ex-bf because of his religion. Based from Hae's diary and all their friends, the breakup only happened in Mid-December which is fairly fresh and only few weeks prior to Jan. 13, Adnan have motive plus, ask yourself when did he wrote the the 'I will kill' note on their initial breakup letter? Why did his phone pinged for an outgoing call near the burial site when he said at the time he was at the mosque? Adnan said he lent his car to Jay bcos he is hanging out with him to kind of remind him to buy Stephanie, Jay's girlfriend, a gift, if that is so, where is this gift, when did Jay got the gift and gave it to his gf?",

There’s a 14K gold bracelet and gold plated ring with a pink stone. Even though she mentions Jay did see her on the day of her birthday, it was some time after 11pm and he didn’t give her the gifts then. And this is despite him claiming he asked Jenn to take him straight to his girlfriend because he was so worried about her safety, when Jenn picked him up at 8pm from Westview Mall/or his home. As for the trips to the mall, Jay said he and Adnan went to the mall together before taking him back to school. Adnan says they didn’t. Interestingly, Jay also says he went to a mall a second time with Mark Pusateri, Jenn’s younger brother. Finally, as for the flowers in Hae’s car, it’s very hard to say when she received them and if she even received them from Adnan at all. If we’re to go by the State’s timeline, it would be hard to imagine Adnan being able to get the flowers between last bell at 2:15 and the CAGM call at 2:36. That would mean Adnan would have had to be walking around school with a bouquet of flowers but no one says anything like that.",

        "text": "​@laurendal1588 Thank you! Very good points. I was thinking he could have bought the flowers during his vacant time when he was with Jay at the mall then, just hid it in his bag or locker during his last class.\n\nSaw a news article recently saying, one of the DNA matches a man related to Adnan to which many say could be Bilal. I think Bilal may be guilty but only as accessory to the murder because the crime could have been easily done by two people and Adnan would not have to recruit the \"pathetic\" Jay in the first place. The fact that Jay possessed information that could only be known to those involved directly to the murder such as the location of Hae's car and position Hae's body upon burial means that even if Bilal have motive, he could not have worked alone. The fact that Adnan was seen with Jay mutliple times that day could only mean either it's Adnan-Jay or all three of them in on the plan. Among Adnan, Jay, and Bilal, we know who has the easist opportunity to get close to Hae, isolate her then, strangle her to death without much signs of physical struggle inside the car and all within that short window of time between the end of her class at 2:15PM and her appointment to pick-up her cousin at 3:30PM. I don't understand how people could be so conviced that Adnan is innocent when he has strong motive, weak ambigious alibis that no one can corroborate, an accomplice confessed with first-hand guilt knowledge. It was the tower pings on top everything else that sealed his conviction for me. How about you? What do you think about this case?",
