what's up guys sean here and today you're gonna give my honest opinion on captain marble it's finally out Marvel's captain marvel is the movie that we've all been waiting for 11 years that's how long it took for Marvel to finally give us an MCU film with a strong female lead the film that all of us in society kind of needed women especially needed it because we needed this film and in my honest opinion which I'm going to tell you about honestly we honestly did need this film and it was honestly probably the most important film since the invention of the camera but most likely the most important film since the invention of the photograph camera now this movie takes place in the 1990s and it rewrites some of Marvel's history I only wish that it took place before the Big Bang so Captain Marvel could ignite the Big Bang and thus would be the creator of the Marvel Cinematic Universe because we need that in society because women create and men destroy did I mention how much society needed this film that is a product made by multinational corporation in order to make a boatload of money alright all joking aside as many of you know I did make a video prior to the release of this movie to talk about some of the negative attention that the trailers of the movie were getting some of the reaction to brie Larson's comments which her comments were dumb and I talked about them in that previous video but overall I was urging people to wait until the movie came out so that they could actually judge the movie based on its merits and not on any outside forces that video was mostly directed at the people who were making like 30 videos a day about the controversy and about little snippets of the trailer but now that the movie is out I can tell you with 100% certainty that it is substantially mediocre don't get me wrong the movie is watchable you won't fall asleep in the theater there's some interesting stuff and some fun moments with Nick Fury's character although I didn't really need an explanation of Nick Fury's backstory and actually think his overall character is hurt by backstory but Sam Jackson in the movie is good he gives the killer performance and he's probably the best part about the movie that and Ben Mendelsohn's character he plays one of the scrolls again great performance on his part but overall the movie is just really mediocre now look I'm not gonna mince words with you guys the number one thing holding Captain Marvel back from being a good movie is the feminism it is the politics without a shadow of a doubt and I don't usually say that if you watch any of my previous videos that I've done on pop culture outrage I always say that the politics of a movie or show can be completely opposite of my own but if the characters are good if the story is good if whatever political message is weaved in seamlessly into this story then I can still appreciate it as an art form and I almost hesitate saying that it's the feminism that's bringing Captain Marvel down because there are feminist shows and movies that are actually good it's a specific brand of feminism that's featured in this movie that just killed everything going for it and that's the woke sjw brand of feminism because it completely destroys any chance Captain Marvel has of being an actual character [Music] war is a universal language I know renegade so do mercy never occurred to me that one might come from above I've said this before and I'll say it again the number one issue people have with strong female characters is not the strong female part it's the character part because when your characters only trait is that they're strong and they overcome things they're not really a character they're a bland uninteresting power fantasy and that is one of the biggest issues with Captain Marvel in this movie she's not a character she doesn't have a character's arc we never see her get beat down so we have no reason to root for her to overcome any obstacle the message of this movie essentially is that Captain Marvel had all the power all along she doesn't need to learn anything she doesn't need to overcome anything she just has to be herself because she's inherently right because she's a woman this movie completely puts message over story and characters for instance the main villain of this movie tells Captain Marvel over and over and over and over again that she's too emotional now do we see one instance throughout the entire movie where Carol Danvers shows an emotion and that impacts her negatively or impacts the people around her negatively no never happens so what we're left with is that the main villain is telling her that she's too emotional because she's a woman and the main villains a man now this is especially out of place because the guy who keeps telling Captain Marvel that she's too emotional is a Creed he's a member of an alien race so why is this alien racist society constructed like a gender studies majors fantasy it makes no sense the only reason that Captain Marvel is told throughout the film that she's too emotional is because the writer has a cartoonish depiction of American Society like they literally live in a bubble where people in that bubble talk about how evil men always tell women that they're too emotional and the second reason is because this writer also thinks that members of the audience are incredibly incredibly stupid because if the writer had any respect for the intelligence of the audience they would have used an allegory and probably the worst thing about this movie is that there is actually something in the movie that could function as an allegory but it's criminally underused but again the writer must think members in the audience are dumb because instead of using this allegory they tell you what the message of the movie is over and over again in the most hand fisted and clunky way possible and the thing that they could have used for the allegory that I'm talking about is a power inhibitor that's actually placed on Captain Marvel's neck throughout the course of the movie now the inhibitor is touched upon in the movie but it should have been focused on a lot more if you're trying to convey a message in the movie in a subtle way instead of the most hand fisted way possible like they decided to Captain Marvel was repeatedly told throughout the movie that the inhibitor helps her control her powers but in reality it helps the Kree control her a lot of this movie hinges on the fact that the Kree are actually the bad guys and the scrolls are the good guys so wouldn't it be interesting if at that same point Captain Marvel figured out that the chip that they put in her neck is actually inhibiting her powers rather than helping her control them you see telling the story this way serves the message that she's being lied to controlled and actually suppressed by an evil organization but it fits the story of the movie way more than a weird alien race that somehow functions on a cartoonishly bad patriarchy [Music] we have no idea what threats are out there the other big issue in this movie is that nothing really impacts Carol Danvers nothing changes her as a person like she works with Star Force or whatever the frickin cria organization is called in the beginning of the movie it is told to us the audience that she's been working with them for six years and presumably she would have developed a bond with them but when she finds out that they're evil and that the scrolls who she spent the last six years of her life the only part of her life that she can remember fighting are the good guys she kind of just takes it in stride because you know she's strong strong female I mean if you guys found out that you were brainwashed by an evil alien race and all you could remember was a light the people you trusted live with work with for the past six years were evil and hiding things from you you take it in stride too right that's that's a normal thing that a character would just gloss over well Captain Marvel does because strong female another issue in the movie is that Captain Marvel just solves every problem in the movie by powering up there's a really interesting sequence I would probably call it one of the best sequences with her character in the entire movie where her hands are bound and she has to fight her way out of a situation because she can't use her energy blast it's shown to us earlier in the movie that her hand-to-hand skills are kind of lacking in that regard and she needs her energy blast so it was interesting to see what she would do when that was taken away and it's fun for a little while but then she just powers up and melts the handcuffs and uses her energy blast because she just got stronger in that moment now it would be fine if that kind of thing happened one time or maybe it happened due to her letting go of her emotions because the Kree are trying to suppress her by telling her she's too emotional but it happens three times and all three times it happens without a real justification so you end up watching a character that's not really that compelling because you know if she ever gets into a bind she's just going to power up and get out of that by [Music] I'm not what you think I am there's also no real moment that shows that she's special that she's uniquely heroic for example in Captain America the First Avenger a general throws a grenade at a bunch of soldiers everybody scatters but Steve Rogers jumps on the grenade to save his comrades it turns out to be a dud but it shows us in the audience in a fantastic way that Steve Rogers is Captain America and the super-soldier formula is really just a formality war gets two of these moments in his first movie where he stands up to a killer robot when he doesn't have his powers and gets beaten down for it and the second one is when he destroys Rainbow Road in order to save the frost giant now the reason I point out that this type of scene is missing from Captain Marvel is because this type of scene is really important it makes us want to root for the hero it shows that what makes them a hero is not their powers it's something innate it's something inside that they're also integral to character arcs Thor started out as an arrogant prince who wanted to destroy the frost giants for glory during the course of the movie he's humbled he's sent to earth he falls in love and his character arc is completed when he destroys the path to what he wants the woman that he loves in order to save those same frost giants costs right what good [Music] Captain Marvel has no such scene and the sad part about it is that there's a perfect scene that could have been in the movie and it's so obvious I'm convinced that at one point it was in the script but then somebody decided that this would actually make her an interesting and compelling character so they took it out it is established that Carol Danvers and her friend who I will refer to as her friend join the Air Force at a time when they didn't let women fly in planes now the way that Carol ends up getting her powers is that she flies an experimental plane that shot down by the Kree the plane explodes and she merges with another Kree who's posing as a military scientist now the scene that's missing from the movie and so obviously should be in the movie is the scene where Carol proves to the scientists that she is worthy to fly this experimental plane what made that Kree scientists choose her above all other candidates what makes her special it didn't need to be anything crazy just a scene that shows that she has a higher level of integrity than the other candidates or she has something else that Marvel was looking for in a pilot maybe she does really well and the Air Force decides to make her the first female fighter pilot maybe she proves herself but the Air Force still doesn't let her be a pilot maybe the Air Force gives her an exemption from the no female rule but doesn't exempt her friend and she decides that she's not going up without a friend because her friends been with her every step of the way and she thinks that she also deserves to be a pilot then the scientist sees that she's willing to give up her dream for her friend because she feels like both of them earned it and it wouldn't be right for her to just get it and her friend to be left out and then the scientist recruits her into the secret program that's how she ends up the pilot of the plane the plane crashes and that's how she gets her powers you know something to show us that the most special thing about her isn't that she shoots lasers from her hands it's the kind of person that she is something that makes her more relatable something that makes her a character instead of just a strong female who happens to be wandering through a movie and honestly it's just things like that that make this movie really disappointing there are so many missed opportunities that could have made it work but instead they wanted to convey the message that doing whatever she wanted and just being herself makes her a hero when in real we want to see somebody be heroic so that we can consider them a hero so yeah Captain Marvel in the bottom tier of Marvel movies so far it could have been better had they actually you know thought about the ideas that they were trying to explore in the movie instead of just pushing social justice nonsense in the most ham fisted way anyway those are my thoughts let me know what you guys think in the
