Somehow people became relevant against Thanos (yes he was weakened and it was an ambush) but exactly what happened to Rhodes should have happened to all of them. Thanos dropped Norrin in 6 blows, Fucking Ironfist was part of the raid crew (feel free to correct me if this is wrong) and somehow survived! No one on that team was remotely close to his level yet they somehow survived. Like I said, Civil war is NOT a showcasing of their regular power level. It was a mess.",

Carol Danvers has no dynamic character arc, which could work if the movie was written to use a flat character arc (much like how shonen character arcs are written), but the surrounding story beats heavily suggest that some sort of character progression should be taking place and none ever happens. It felt disjointed for beats to go by and you'd expect change of some sort, especially in regards to Carol apparently being too emotional as the movie stated that it was a problem 3 times before the climax (if I remember correctly), but nothing ever comes about. Lazy writing made a potential 8 or 9/10 a 5/10.",

She enhances his character with her virtue. This subtlety seemed to be missed by many. Capt. Marvel where can she go? If she's \"flawless\" and has no romantic mobility what's the point. What seems to be frequently missed is that action scenes are the bonus for most men, we still want a story to follow. \nNever heard guys bash Widow, Underworlds, Wonder woman, Resident Evils, etc where there were strong lead female characters...folks like Brie have incorrectly identified a \"problem\". \n\nWhat I am saying is that I agree, it's not necessarily the \"feminist\" slant... it's the character and the story that were problematic and missed the mark.",

    "text": "Dude you are 100% right about what makes a hero a hero. This is why I often find myself looking at those early Marvel movies as worthy of being canonical they show us all their journey from average individual to the pantheon of greatness where the true heroes dwell. The first third of the Captain America flick is an amazing retelling of Steve Rogers' life and his beliefs. He refuses to back down from bullies despite the fact he was a little guy with no chance at winning. These acts of character, like despite the odds or outcome standing for what is right against a bully are as big a heroic symbol as the emblematic Captain America costume itself. Cap is the essence of truth justice and the American way to the old school fans. Without all of that Steve Rogers is just some super soldier fighting for his country. But when you add his morals into the mix he becomes this throwback to the purity and naivete of the 40s and 50s. Its his heart that got him chosen to begin with and that small realization is what codified Cap into the hero he is well was now that SJW Marvel writers turned him into a sleeper agent of Hydra which is why despite his best efforts can never defeat them.  SJW writers ruin everything IMHO",

    "text": "I would say that the single best example of how to fit politics into a movie without ruining the movie is Casablanca. While we don't think about it in the modern day, that movie was absolutely made as a political allegory which people at the time would've noticed. Even though it was released in 1942, it was filmed before Operation Barbarossa, in June 1941, as evidenced by the fact that Renault mentions the Germans fighting on only one front. Notice how the characters are all allegories for the country they come from. Rick is an isolationist, and someone who doesn't care for the politics of the outside world and simply wants to rake in the benefits of it. Renault secretly hates the Germans, but puts on a very good face when dealing with them, and makes them seem like his friends. Laszlo is a man with nothing but the clothes on his back, not even a country to return to, and yet he never gives up fighting, no matter what the consequences might be. The whole point of the movie was to convince America to join the war, but they don't beat you over the head with it",

They’re “terrorists” apparently, but if you ask the skrulls they’re refugees. \n\nBut my favorite line is when Captain Marvel is talking to the Supreme Intelligence and their justification on what they did to the Skrulls (persecution based on lies) was “were just trying to protect our border!” \n\nIdk, it came off weird to me.\n\nEdit - as someone pointed out, I misheard What Ronan said, or mistook how it was supposed to sound. I took it as him correcting him that she isn’t the weapon, but he probably meant that he’s gonna come after her because she’s basically what they were after originally or whatever. \n\nBut the whole border parts are still a little odd to me.",

I think there can be a theme that might be more associated with politics, but as long as it’s not directly about politics and obvious it’s fine. There’s a difference between showing women can be strong, powerful, and independent without constantly showing jerk men with ‘toxic masculinity’. It’s just the worst.",

    "text": "Can't say I really found myself caring about their attempts of a feminist messaged movie, but that is probably because I found the character to be so ridiculously bland I found myself concentrating more on the side characters then her.  Wonder Woman was interesting and had depth....this person was about as flat as a piece of paper...finds out her comrades were lying the whole time,  no reaction....what should be an emotional scene of her friend being concerned about whether or not she was talking to her friend or not just her body...no reaction. The cat showed more reaction then Captain Marvel. Finds out she's stronger then she thought...easy uses and controls her powers...not the trial and error like Iron Man or even a bit of the clumsiness of Steve Roger  when they first started out...just perfect for the get go. It was all ridiculously bland",

(I'll acknowledge that some people are hard to please: powerful woman=Mary sue, woman who overcomes literally any physical barrier=unrealistic, woman who outmarts men=sjw character.). Captain marvel was always going to be an unsatisfying movie because the character is essentially invincible.  \nI have no problem with a movie with a female character who is better than men even if it's inexplicable (star wars) because it's a fantasy. I have a problem when a movie sells itself as smashing the patriarchy, and says anyone who disapproves is sexist. \nEven then my only real problem with captain marvel is people saying that it is the best. It was just ok, and that's ok. It's not the best marvel movie, and it's not the worst (that's thor 2). It just is.",

The reason characters like Iron Man, Hulk, Thor, and Black Widow do so well IS because they have faults and had to hit the bottom at some point. Tony was arrogant and almost died at the hands of his own creation. Then he had to over come the position of dying in a cave to save himself and then completely change his way. Thor was a similar story. Bruce had the problem of dealing with the Hulk and tried to kill himself when he was at the bottom. Then he came to terms with what he is and grew to control it. Black Window has a dark bloody past she always has hanging over her. Carol in the movie gets huge amount of power with pretty much 0 downside.",

You could have a female lead character and still have her be strong, the problem lies is that just not remembering how awesome you are but still being awesome isn't anything. All the other heroes have problems they have to over come and no not problems like the makeup used by captain marvel. They got hurt and had to redeem themselves. Marvel does t have to redeem shit she just takes a thing off her neck and remembers her past....ooooooooo such a challenge. Her hair doesn't even get messed up during her last fight let alone get a bloody nose. I mean fuck...if she is that tough why was thanos even a problem??",

That conclusion is ALL YOU that is not in the movie.\n\nThe message of the movie is about finding the confidence within yourself and that you are more powerful than you believe.... There is NO cavaet of 'Only if you are a woman'...  \nThis is a universal message of self empowerment, NOT limited to feminists and women.  Yes it obviously applies to women and yes the lead is a woman, but YOU are the one who is thinking it is purely a feminist message.\n\nYou repeatedly add 'because she's a woman'... That is all YOU... that is your bias showing through.\n\nThe whole 'you're too emotional' thing was about being honest with your feelings and not hide from them.  That applies to men just as well.  And goes to the self-empowerment theme.\n\nHonest question. You said \"it is established that Carol Danvers and her friend...who I will refer to as 'her friend' \".... Why did you say this? I honestly don't know what you are alluding to.\n\nYOU are the one hung up on the cartoonish characture... in this case of an activist liberal 'SJW' Disney screenwriter.\n\nYou obviously when into this move looking for feminist elements for you to hate.  You never really gave this movie a chance.  You wanted to hate this movie because you hate SJWs SO much.  That comes across in this video loud and clear.",

    "text": "Look at Mythra for a strong female character with bonkers powers and a real arc for it, her whole damn story. Yes, it's a video game, yes Xenoblade 2 has writing issues, doesn't change the fact she is prove that writing a technically overpowered female character (like any) is possible; and before you argue that she is not the lead character, look at the story from different angles. Many characters are very fleshed out, especially in the later released prestory. Looking at it like that, Mythra and Malos become the key main characters in this Jungian play.\n\nSpoilers:\nThe thing with XC2, with all its errors, is that almost all its characters are written so strongly they can stand on their own. Jin is a fall from grace, consumed by nihilism after the loss of his love. Addam, who seems a too perfect and strong hero, a leader and ruler anyone would wish for, is revealed to be quite wary of his weak points and insecurities that he knows he cannot show as it would demoralize everyone. Rex is an inexperienced naive late teen with a kind heart, yet he knows little about the world and when it is better to retreat instead of keep charging recklessly headfirst against an ultimate force, devastated at losing the only father figure he's ever had in his life and only known for a brief few days who sacrificed himself for him and his friends before his eyes - still teaching him something all the while. Malos, the antagonist has depth too. He could have destroyed the world easily at any moment, including during the prestory. He has that power, just like Mythra. Yet his plans encompass more than that, he is not merely about destruction of everything.\nMythra herself, with her equally strong powers? She is afraid of them, a battle with the Jungian shadow, that permeates ever chapter in this story (an issue Nia shares with her). She kept herself short for Addam could not control her at first, but even then it was just a glimmer of her true capatbilities. When she lost control and destroyed more than just Malos, the grief and trauma was so strong she never wanted to touch those powers again and created a fake personality, a split in herself, if you will.\nThe reemergence came only in a dire moment to save a loved one - looking like a classic japanese Deus Ex Machina moment, yet knowing the story it makes perfect sense and still has limitations.\nIn effect, it turns out to be a battle between godlike powers in which all other characters are mere backdrop. Something to make the time worthwhile and interesting and give meaning: Life.\nEventually, Mythra learns to integrate her shadow thanks to her friends and loved ones and thereby gains the true power of herself which allows to overcome any obstacle together.\n\nIn end, even Mythra's lack of cooking skills would make for a greater character flaw than anything Captain Feminist Face has.\nSomething so frustrating to Mythra that her fake artificial personality was able to cook the most sublime of things.\n\nMythra's personality grows from a coldshouldered snobbish tsundere reckless with her powers, to a meek ever kind loving friend afraid of her powers, to someone truly integrated in the self at peace and balance with herself, ending in self-sacrifice for her friends and the world itself. With this arc no matter her powers, she is an interesting an lovable character.\n\nCaptain Marvel on the other hand? Never a change. Boring, bland, irrelevant. A true power fantasy. A feminist fetish story.",
