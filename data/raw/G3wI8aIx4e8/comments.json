I live in a nice building but the law requires a certain amount of section 8 units.  Since my city is highly corrupt, leftist city, it's usually criminals that get these units i.e. they pay someone off to get bumped on the list and placed in a nice building.  All my neighbors and I have ring cams, we call the cops and know them on a first name basis so they get arrested and evicted a lot until a new one lands in one of those units.  They rarely last 6 months.  They pay the first month then squat.  Dirty entitled people.",
