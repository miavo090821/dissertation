It's so easy to just dismiss all of their pain and suffering when you never had to live in constant danger or go through all of the problems they went through in their original country. Coming to the US illegally is typically done out of necessity - they weighed the pros and cons of doing it and ultimately the opportunities/potential for a higher well-being for their families take priority over the risks. And like you said, many people do not have the time, money, or safety to do it legally. The situation for many of these people is just not that simple.",

Donald Trump’s movement essentially uses all the same tropes as the Nazis used to get in power, xenophobia, anti-intellectualism, ultra-nationalism, traditionalism, newspeak (e.g. fake news vs lugenpresse), economic populism (but not really), communist fear-baiting, reactionary politics, anti-establishmentism, dog-whistles, and of course, violence. And trust me, there’s plenty more where that came from. But people are basically taking the stance that until we start seeing mass genocide in camps, we cannot draw that comparison. Well I hate to state what is surely obvious, but by then, it will be much too late.",

In other words, they were in very bad shape (dying) when they were found and brought to the facilities on the border. Sadly, not all could be saved.\nYou should ensure your news diet is varied. This channel is a bit much sometimes. I remember well how he framed the extraordinary rapid and succesful muslim military campaigns of the 7th - 8th centuries, and the occupation that followed as 'more or less peaceful shifts of governments, followed by a benevoulent, tolerant and generous muslim rule'. Obviously, the Steven Crowder version of these events is a bit much in the other direction. 3 Arrows and him are opposite extremes.\nBe well.\nPeace...",

I would like to see you applyn this superficial “everybody was good once” philosophy if it happened to your family, not just as a theoretical thought experiment where its easy to pretend you would do otherwise. \n\nIf your wife and daughter get brutally r*aped and murdered in front of you, i would like to see how you apply your naive outlook then.

Looking at history, there clearly isn't.\r\n\nYour anger is understandable, it should be respected and it's not a virtue. Correcting injustices done to you by punishing the wrongdoer is an inherently human response. But who does it help, really? \nYou're right, if someone hurt my family or if I spent my entire life living under the thumb of a seemingly distinct group of people,  of course I'd feel rage. Of course I wouldn't listen to reason. But so what? That wouldn't make me right, it would make me a dangerous liability, as any isolated angry man is.\nWe can't ignore such angry men, of course and it's not quite true that their feelings are completely counterproductive, as they help them and their loved ones deal with their trauma as well as highlight injustices that societies should work to rectify but(!) we also try to placate them is because if we don't they'll likely form into some kind of militia with no accountability. \n\nAnd now, to exemplify why people are telling you that your thinking is wrong.\n1) These people are committing atrocities against us, we must do something about it!\n2) Any action we take against them is completely justified, no matter how punitive! Brutal deaths, torture, they're doing the same to us!\n\n\n3) Ok so it turns out, people aren't okay with us brutally killing their friends and family so they've exacted revenge on us, for this reason, let's start preemptively killing the friends and family of the bad group too.",

        "text": "@d007ization  im glad you took the time to lay out your position. Let me honor that by laying out mine. i have kids, and i know what innocence looks like. There is an inherent innocence in humans and there is an inherent value and moral goodnesss in preserving that innocence as much as posssible. Naturally, the brutal conditions of nature have turned man into beast, set them upon each other, out of desperation at first and yet for many, malice and pleasure is derived soon thereafter. Innocence is lost,\nperverted and raped. \n\nI do not consider my anger a virtue, in fact i fully aknowledge that it is partially kin to the abomination that i wish to do away with, yet the key difference is that it is indeed justified and understandable, and i would argue inevitable. It is the natural opposite reaction to the dark imperfections of this world. You ask who this anger helps? This anger that drives the natural human response of seeking justice? It helps victims find closure, it helps future victims avoid crossing paths with the degenerates that chose to victimise others because they were afraid of becoming victims themselves. It is a motivating force that gives you strength to be selfless and ferocious against the wicked.\n\nThis nihilistic form of moral relativism where one asks “who does it help, really?” I find to be little more than a rationalised helplesness, and I refuse to be helpless. I reject the belief that it helps no one. I am batman. Jokes aside, i find it unreasonable to tell oneself that there is a rational reason why rage is unnecessary in face of genuine injustice. As you mentioned before, it is the natural response. The mere fact that you can rationalise about it, doesn’t automatically make it invalid, and unworthy of being acted upon. It would not only make you right to act against genuine oppression, to stand for those who cannot protect themselves from abuse, rape, pillaging, etc. it would make you moral. \n\nI am aware of the irational nature of such a path, and its kinship to the very forces of abuse and oppresion it seeks to destroy. I am aware of the pitfall of rage consuming purpose and becoming blind, effectively becoming the same thing it set out to destroy. Qanon is a good example of this. Certainly, it is a volatile thing. But in my opinion, that is precisely why rational thought and reasoning should not reject our natural impulses of righteous rage. It should seek to temper it, to direct it and to realise its destiny in destroying all those who seek to take the light and innocence away from the world. \n\nA bully cannot be rationalised with, a bully cannot be pleaded with, or even bargained with. A bully will understand only one thing and that is might, fuelled by righteous rage against the injustices they subject the world to. And if we want to get past human oppression, abuse, rape, tyranny, we must not render ourselves impotent of a response by using our rational capacities to established a rationalised helplessness, we must use our rational capacity to employ our justified anger as a mount, and trample all those who chose to spit on their own innocence and humanity beneath its fiery hooves. Destroy all those who chose to build their joy on the tears and wailing of families torn apart, peoples enslaved, daughters defiled. It is inevitable, it is angers purpose and destiny.\n\nThe sooner we accept that anger is part of the equation, the sooner we may learn how to master it and not be blindly lead by it. Like shaolin warriors, who professed love and harmony with all living thing and yet had to employ their anger of seeing their homes and peoples pillaged, in order to perfect tools of righteous retribution. \n\nWe cannot sit idly by and calmly rationalise the monsters of humanity away. This is precisely the sentiment that allowed hitler to come to power and commit the atrocities that he did. Never again ⚡️⚡️⚡️",

        "text": "@templecreations2351 To right wrongs it is justice that is required, not vengeance. Vengeance is deeply personal and afflicted with the sins of man. A man seeking vengeance wishes to see his enemy experience the pain enacted upon him, and thus brings unessessary suffering into the world. Justice, however, is ideally impartial. Defined by the rule of law, and judged by the citizens of the nation, justice seeks to deliver impersonal punishment that the majority of society can agree is just. Vengeance will turn a people against each other, prompting them to enact suffering on one for the actions of another. \n\nThe night of broken glass was a movement of vengeance against the Jewish people for the assassination of a German diplomat by a French Jew. Justice would see the Jew brought to trail and be judged for his actions. Vengeance would see the slaughter of his people to cause him great anguish.\n\nYou liken yourself to Batman, but the reason why he refuses to kill is because he believes that it would lower him to thier level. He delivers evildoers to the justice system to see thier crimes stand before trial, to have them be judged by the masses instead of by himself. Perhaps you agree with me.\n\nThe reason why justice is important is because nobody can claim to be the wise king, perfect judge of morality. Humans are deeply flawed creatures who easily fall prey to possession by personal demons or collective evil. It should be expected that humans are not born good or neutral, but tribal animals who must work to adopt morals and avoid possession by the collective will. The nazis rose because the collective will shifted towards them. The general consensus amoung Germans was that of humiliation and exploitation, which was aimed at Europe and perceived traitors to the country such as the Jews. The man who promised to set things right and bring vengeance upon Germany's enemies ended up taking power.\n\nHundreds of innocent Iranian lives were lost because US citizens wanted vengence for 9/11. Many Iranians sought vengeance against the west in turn. Both sides felt righteous fury for the wrongs done to them and thier people.\n\nAfter WWII the allies did not seek to  enact vengence upon the German people for the evil they helped nurture. They sought to bring justice upon those who did the most wrong, and then extend compassion to the German people, as though possessed by the hatred of the Jews, they were only human. Doing so prevented the unnecessary humiliation and suffering from the first war.\n\nEvil is as rooted in humanity as good. Even a relatively moral man can find himself chanting for blood along with the mob. Seeing those who commit atrocity as human makes us aware of the fact that evil can easily take root within our own hearts.",

When your daughter is raped and murdered, even if you were generally a honourable man of the law, you can kiss all that rationale goodbye, and that is completely understandable. While i do not think we should condone vengeance, in certain situations we can certainly understand why the need for it arises. Lets not pretend we are above it. \n\nAlso, you conflate political vengeance with actual personal vengeance. You speak of sin, but i do not share your sentiments of an existence of such thing. There is rationale,\nMorality and our impulses. And its a\nConstant balancing act between then. In general i am not against the sentiment that one needs to be careful of not letting rage take over and lead to even more violence, but thats not what ive been talking about in general, so thats kinda of a slippery slope fallacy.",

Lindbergh runs on a very simple, easy to comsume and repeat platform of \"anti-war\" isolationism, nationalism, and dogwhistle rhetoric and in the end defeats FDR and becomes president. The series primarily follows a middle class Jewish family from New Jersey and chronicals their lives under and leading up to the Lindbergh Administration.\nIt also explores how certain members of marginalized communities can actually become complicit with the people marginalizing them which is something I very much relate to as a leftist jew with right wing relatives.",

You have no choice where you are born, who you are born to, what jobs you get, how people treat you, your genetics, plus all the shit your Brain does unconsciously. So by generous estates you have maybe control over 20% of your life. Unless you ignore the mri and twin studies. Then it’s like 40z science has been arguing nature vs nurtured psychology and biology basically stoped arguing about free will in the 40s. So yes it has \nTwin studies and mris pretty much price this. \nNow where you are correct is that we cannot predict these outcomes. There are way too many variables. So it’s not determinism it’s basically random chance. But random and free will are different \nWhat we now know about humans is that we are probability machines. So for example we are twins separated both play music, but both are competitive. So the one with siblings that play sports, plays sports. So music is probably genetic and sports is probably nurture. \nGood people aren’t a thing. And yes good people can very easily made to do bad things. It’s proven time and time again. Unless you mean exceptional in which case there are very few good humans. So there were the originator of the Nazis, the followers, and the victims those are the inherent groups. \nThen there are the regular people and the resistors.

Secondly, I said that it’s not determinism. We don’t know the outcomes. It’s way too varied. If you are told to kill someone by a rando you likelihood of doing it is very low. But if you are familiar with them or they have authority or are in a group and the group is doing it those all increase your chances of murdering this person. Granted you may be the type of person who will never murder. Those people exist too. Just like there are people who won’t defend themselves.\nThird, once again we are probability machines. If you get rid of consequences probability goes way up. If we have free will (which if we do it’s small)then the actual free will part is choosing our environment to maximize the desired probability. Getting rid of consequences is not the same.\n\nNow I would agree if you say something like God  made us and there is no free will \nThen maybe we get rid of jails. \nHowever, then God made us make jails\nAnd we can’t get rid of them or he wants us to get rid of jails. \nSo even then...",

You use the word punishment but the bear isn’t being punished. We all understand that the bear doesn’t really have a choice. We accept my statement when it comes to animals. We don’t accept it when it comes to people. \nOk if a child is beat it will cause them mental health problems for the rest of their life. They have literally no control over that. That person may manifest it internally (beating themselves up) or externally (hurting others). If they have the money to get mental health treatment they may overcome this. However, without the resources they can’t. So what choice do they have. They had none really. \nThe fact is mostly choices are illusions our brain  create. Knowing this our genetic codes are all probability then the environment is all we can control. That isn’t guaranteed. \nMost Nazis were regular people who only chose to fight the Nazis before they got into power. Then once the Nazis were in power they just went along because they had been programmed to. Children who were educated by the Nazis all chose becusse they were told to. Then the ones who resisted were also taught to resist. There was little to no choice involved.

        "text": "@Ninjaananas what the Nazis did was indeed evil but the question is. Did the Nazis themselves find it evil? \n\nThe truth is, many of the Nazis didn't think their actions were evil at all and many others did find it evil but it was justified. The bottom line is they think they are of good moral standing while carrying out atrocities. \n\nVery few people are actually psychopaths who know they are doing evil but dont care. Very few people are also sociopaths who don't see their actions as evil at all. Psychologists debate weather if it's even possible to have a true psychopath. \n\nYou can't just dismiss the entire German people a sociopaths or psychopaths. These are incredibly rare disorders. The Nazis were just common German people who were probably convinced their actions were righteous or justified. It's important to understand how they may have come to that conclusion so we don't repeat it ourselves.\n\nBut one element I want to point out is the Nazis thought they were moral. That means you or I could easily think of ourselves as moral but on the side we can totally be hiding skeletons in our closet. The thing is, we wouldn't even realize it because we think we are morally right. We could be part of a ideological bubble making fallacious arguments about the opposing side and trying to get them cancelled with smears and lies. We could be writing for CNN or Fox News. None of that stuff is even close to what the Nazis did but it's just ways we can act dishonestly and still think we are morally right. We have a tendency to follow the heard in this regard so we can easily slip into the far right crowd or far left crowd without even realizing it. That's what happened to the Nazis.",

        "text": "@Ninjaananas You are right to a certain extent:\nYou cant explain away personal responsibility over an action taken.\nBut you speak from a superior, historical perspective. And you dont seem to understand how fascism works. Its a totally different social paradigm, under it we wouldnt be able to discuss this topic, not only due to obvious censorship, but due to it probably never coming up or you having no incentive to discuss it because it would be easier for survival or social standing or even for your worldview and personal pride- which in this case, quite different from more free societies, would be closely linked- not to do so, thus it being disincentivised for the majority of the population.\n\nFirst: to make the \"moral\" descision one would be able to get access towards an objective truth. The information around the descision free from manipulation. As long as the Nazis controlled the media, people had only access to the truth the propaganda ministry put out. Add to that criminal charges like \"Wehrkraftzersetzung\" \"undermining defence force\" or \"Führerbeleidigung\" \"insulting the leader\" or criminalising listening to unchecked \"foreign propaganda\" like non-german radio stations or even music.\nThus making any effective public positioning towards the real crimes by the NS regime who tried their best to keep up an air of plausible deniability- really hard. To a point where it would be suicide, nobody will listen to somebody willing to commit suicide. You will be categorised as a maniac, a fanatic, out of a sheer need for self protection which I will cover in the next point. Also- who would start such a movement? Who can be trusted not to be a Gestapo spy? Rooting out \"internal enemies\" was the first thing the Nazis did, people kept their opinions close at heart and all the public- at least through every channel of gaining information- seemed to support them, down to a level of a party-controlled neighboorhood guard which made even personal exchanges of non-approved information rather difficult.\n\nSecond, that descision requires freedom to make said choice. Because besides the first paragraph people SAW what was going on. Rumours WERE going around. Why did only a point of a percentage of people act on this? Because it was easier not to act to keep up the official lifestyle and deny repression. It was easier on the conscience because it denies personal responsibility in a \"Volksgemeinschaft\" kind of \"we are all in it together system\" if one imagines crimes dont happen- remember, the Nazis ruled with nominal democratic legitimacy. If the crimes committed and the surpression system around them become so horriffic at a certain point people will just... ignore them, either to be able to sleep at night by forgetting what \"our guys\" are actually doing or just to be able to live ones own life without persecution. \n\nIts all foreign propaganda! As if such a thing was possible! We are the good guys!\n\nThis gets accompanied by subconscious guilt,- people arent that stupid and usually have a conscience- which is solved by neglect, vain justifications like \"they do it to\" and aggression against people who speak out because they became a threat for you and your worldview that may expose the dark you managed to hide beneath a thin sheet of normality. \nIt basically tearing apart the social and the private- your social life is under foreign controll, all the input you receive is normed- this will shift you as well, make you more easily controlled. Those are basic triggers of human social life and their controll is often outside your own sphere of influence. If you grew up with a certain definition of pride for example, that pride can be used to manipulate you if the critical information channels blancing this are closed. Or with a definition of \"us\" vs a definition of \"them\". Its the subjectivity were human conscience is hackable.\n\nAlso you must consider the role of individuals in this. Hannah Ahrendt famously wrote of the banality of evil if you are aware of that concept- how far is a cog in the evil machine able to act evil itself? Sure, the head, purpose and controll of every part of the machine can be considered as such, but was the train driver who had to transport \"prisoners\" eastward to the KZs explicitly evil for doing his job? What about the soldier and the firing order against civilians- if refusing it is possible but frowned upon? What if said soldier was in a \"Strafbattallion\" and unable to controll his situation? Is the KZ prisoner manifacturing V2s in order to receive food and not be send to the deathcamps evil because he enabled the bombing of London? The Kapos, were they evil?  Its a question of the liberty of millions of individuals to make thousands of individual moral choices daily- you can cry \"liberty or death all you want, but death is what you certainly would receive-, the subjective categorisation of that choice, how it was carried out, and why. \n\nThis requires constant monitoring of ones self and the society at large, defences against the erosion of democracy into fascism. \nI would heartily recommend reading \"The Wave\"- a story that explains how people slip into such a societal gridlock that enables this shutdown of reason that you so correctly identify. Highlighting this doesnt deny the individual responsibility of the people involved, but it explains how those systems come to pass. Its like committing crimes when drunk- under fascism people get drunk on some mythos and commit brutal acts in the name of a collective they wouldnt do otherwise, because under the system they live in, it benefits them and offers the temptation of an alternative reality that denies any personal responsibility.\nBut there is also responsibility in getting so drunk that we committed the crime in the first place.\n If we can understand the drug, we can prevent people getting drunk. Prevent people getting drunk and you may prevent the crime.\n\nOn the other hand, pretending you are unable to commit a crime because you are always reasonable is the first step in getting drunk. It negates critical thought for pride. If there is no motivator to question oneself, people will act on their worst impulses, especially if empathy is artificially surpressed- for example by racist ideology, even under the flimsiest pretence one is able to commit horrible acts if one can pretend that they are necessary.\n\nSo its important to identify the system that led to the crimes in order to prevent the crimes, not bash anyone around for complex individual choices they probably werent able to make to the extent you would like to think. \nAnd sry for me saying this, but if you are not one in a thousand, you would just go with the crowd. In their shoes, you probably will take the same actions because quite often, the rational choice in the moment was more concerned with staying sane or alive or simply being able to sleep at night, to protect your family. Your conscience isnt your only motivator if you have bigger responsibilities. \n\nThere are forces in human society that go far beyond the actions of individuals, and fascism is a system that denies individuality contrary to the narrative in the first place.",

You do not have to discuss this with someone to know that murder is unethical and there have been many Germans which independendly deduced the immorality of the nazi regime. The least you could was being non-conformist and this could have beem done by anyone with low risk of consequences. \n\nYou can make moral decision based on logical conclusions. Like concluding that genocides are not okay and not falling for the lies because there is no justification for it.\nAnd the regime did not last long. Most people knew a time before the regime.\n\nI do not blame people for not daring the visibly opposing the nazis. That was dangerouse. I blame those who activly supported the nazis. Those who supported the ideology and those who helped the murdering. \n\nYou had the freedom to to stay away from most active support. You could have lived your life trying to support as little as possible without getting suspected. \nIt was very apparent that the nazis destroyed the democracy. \n\nThere were enough signs that the nazis were not the good guys. It begins with the logical conclusions that murder and persecution are not ethical. \nThen there is the obvious oppression which create the fear of opposing the nazis in the first place.\n\nI am considering the individual all the time here. What do you think we were even talking about? \nIf you know that your job will lead you into doing attrocious things and there is a safe way of quitting the job, then you should do so.\nWhat you are doing to survive because you have no other choice is excusable but many thing were not necessary for survival. \nYou did not have to become member of state organs. The doctors did not have to make horrible experiments and the spy did not have to \"realize\" a possible opposition towards the nazis. You did not have to become a spy to begin with. \nI never demanded anyone to risk or sacrifice his or her life. \n\nThat is what I am about. There is a responsibility to all this. I know that there are reason why someone would act like that but it is unethical nonetheless. There are temptationes but there are no excuses. \n\nThat would be again not using the reasoning properly. Self-reflexion is not about creating yourself and illusion of yourself. You have to be aware of dangers and possibly crimes you could do and thus try to avoid them. \nIt is important to know that everyone can act evil and that we need our ethics to keep us from becominf actually evil.\n\nOne in a thousand? Every sentient and mentally healthy human has the ability to act ethical. That is what makes us different from animals and that is why we have this responsibility in the first place. We all can be ethical. Maybe I am one in a thousand for actually caring about ethics but it certainly does not have to be this ratio of ethical people to blind people.",

I agree that in hindsight people are responsible for their actions under said system, but only to the extend where they had a choice for their survival. . But you place the level of choice under such a system far to low. You can be the hero, but you wont be for long.

        "text": "A few points to why this is:\nGerman and English share the same linguistic ancestry, but English ist much easier. for example English doesn’t have grammatic genders (is this the correct term?) or cases that are expressed within the noun and the English sentence structure seams easier to me compared to German.\nWe are confronted with the English language early on in school and most movies etc are produced in English.\nGerman has a rather large vocabulary with very precise words to describe something. Those of us who listen or speak English often tend to search for the most accurate translation for the precise German word we would use..\nBut while it is easy to articulate our thoughts in the English language, the pronunciation is the tricky part. Dan does quite a good job there.. \nyou’re still allowed to make fun of our German accent by the way 😅",

Hell, within just a few days of this post, despite an entire campaign and propaganda blitz about how the border needs to be locked down until the immigration \"invasion\" is handled the Trump admin specifically welcomed white South Africans and ONLY white South Africans to the US under refugee protections based entirely on a racist conspiracy about white South Africans experiencing a silent \"white genocide.\" He fancies himself a king, doesn't feel he should have to abide by term limits like everyone else and is weaponizing the DOJ to arrest local judges and threaten to arrest duly elected Congressmembers who speak out against their fascist smash and grab takeover of the US.\n\nBut hey, the Nazis just popped into existence in 1939 and nothing of note occurred in the years leading up to WW2.

That's \"meddling\" in the affairs of Left fascists, which I have absolutely no problem with.\"\n\nThis argument died decades ago with the Cold War, and for good reason. It was always full of shit. What 'freedom' was won out of Iran through deposing Prime Minister Mossadegh and replacing him with a corrupt monarch? Not a damn thing, and you know it. What it did is give them a dictator who was willing to sell out the country's people to provide valuable resources to the open market at a premium. I think it goes doubly amusing how you try to blame the US's problems on \"left fascists\" (This term means absolutely nothing, it's a negative connotation with no tether to reality) when it was the actions such as this that brought about other country's hatred for the US, and decades later still send shockwaves we have yet to recover from.\n\nThere is no justification for things like Reagan's involvement with the Contras, a covert decision that not only did more harm to the people we claimed to want to help than good, but also did harm to our very own country both domestically and internationally. I don't care what bloody revolution is happening in  a country that is not our own, if we wanted to actually help the situation then we could have handled it completely different. It's not about helping, though. It's about games of geopolitics, special interests, and corrupt or incompetent leadership.\n\nI'm also wondering what planet you live on where you convince yourself there was any good reason for the assisted military coup against Evo Morales, a democratically elected president, loved by his people, who committed the terrible crime of not considering the coca plant within Bolivia's borders a target for the disastrous embarrassment that is the War on Drugs, a decision which by the way was widely popular throughout the country. I'm sorry, but when you start making decision based purely on if they are beneficial for the USA and not respecting policies made by an autonomous country with its own ideas and goals, you demonstrate the reality it is not \"policing the world\" that the USA engages in, but unambiguous imperialism. Any country that is prepared to damn an entire nation of people to dictatorship for the sake of resources and personal gain is the stuff of evil, the kind of force we're supposed to be making a stand against. It's this very act of casual, brutal destabilization we've committed on such a regular basis for decades that has brought the world into the state it is now. You treat socialist uprisings like a force of nature, a freak accident that is neither explainable nor brought up by any consequence of the abuse of power. This is not even exclusive to socialists, but fundamentalist and reactionary terror cells that we personally fund and train, doors we have personally opened, that have participated in the utter destruction of any hope we may have had in bringing democracy and peace to these corners of the world. Now the chickens are coming home to roost, and there's no more room to blame someone else for the quagmire we've steeped ourselves in.\n\nI want to ask you an honest question. Do you believe the USA would or has ever committed to a change in regime that they did not stand to directly benefit from? We're both reasonable people, I think we can safely agree that there is no such thing as a 'benevolent' foreign intervention done by any one country. If something required genuine humanitarian work, it could usually be more easily carried out through the UN where we as a single country would not need to burden ourselves with the sole budget, logistics, or diplomatic collateral that would accompany it. \n\nWhen you strip away the facade of what we claim our foreign policy stands for, so too does the narrative they try to push. It becomes at that point difficult to trust anything that is stated to be done for the good of the country, and for good reason.",

Often these arguments are accompanied by further unsubstantiated claims along the lines of immigrants bringing crime or abusing welfare (which I appreciate that you've not done).",

I'm fine with just deportation, but it seems that no one thinks that's enough.\n\nI don't think housing refugees is a permanent solution either. Those people had houses in the country they fleed from and, to me, it seems the solution would be to re-obtain those houses for the people that have been displaced. In the case of the Jews in the 1920s, that would involve declaring war on Russia for persecuting the Jews. Now though, would it be invading Mexico/South America because they're bad at economics. . ?\n\nIs occupying South America and re-educating them with North American culture feasible or even desirable?\n\nEveryone is saying everyone else's solution is bad and no one is giving a good solution.",

The more desperate people are for things, the more willing they are to commit crimes to get what they want. This makes the greedy rich and the needy poor immoral.\n\nPeople who come here legally may or may not be desperate, but by following the process they have shown that they are not willing to sacrifice their principles to get ahead. They are worthy of being here, more worthy than most Americans no less.\n\nThe people who will hide out in the desert, jump fences, steal identities, and avoid the state are not worthy of being here. They are proving through action that they are selfish and immoral. I don't think that's something that deserves punishment, but it's certainly not deserving of aid or citizenship. They aren't being persecuted in Mexico, they're just poor and their country is shit because their culture is corrupt much like ours is trending towards.\n\nMost of all, I hate how the whole country, or even the whole world feels compelled to talk about this problem when they don't even live here. They don't see the gangs in central Phoenix, they don't bear witness to the sex trafficking or the drug dealing or the micro-societies that have isolated themselves from our state and even subdivided our cities. Just talking about it is making me borderline rant because if the solution is really that simple, why don't *you* fix it?\n\nHeck I've got some savings, I will buy a whole gang of illegals some plane tickets and they can be delivered directly to Germany since apparently they're so experienced in this regard! We'll get on with our lives in America and Angela Merkel can gas the Mexicans as per their Nazi traditions. I mean they already got all of Europe united under one flag smh",

I don’t agree with him at all, but it was as if he hadn’t really ever seen a fair representation of how bad they are. He’s only heard Tucker Carlson and Ben Shapiros take on it. Either way the result is the same. He feels the camps are justified and will continue to vote for atrocious policies - whether or not he considers himself a racist - which he doesn’t. he’s Jewish btw so he really plays the you-can’t-call-them-concentration-camps-because-I’m-Jewish card.

The guards did not look after the children and instead asked the older children to look after the younger ones.\n\nTruly all of those deeds were acts of compassion and contributed to saving the children's lives.

Of course in sake of survival and keep up living and continuing your lineage you should walk away from the war zone and seek asylum somewhere, it's natural for them to migrate to seek a better place, true if it's in a huge influx and they couldn't adapt with local custom also be a huge problem, but you shouldn't try to persecute them, I know social fusing is taking really long time to succeed. And I know this is a huge dilemma, but by arguing with this reason is just straight wrong in moral essence and could be describe as sociopathic, no compassion, no empathy, again human might be much worse being than demon actually from seeing this video, from seeing those mass genocide was committed by people with same mental stability and feeling no guilt at the end. At least ICE shouldn't separating the children at all, that's really an unnecessary measure being ever taken, that's too far, and resulting not much of success in stopping the illegal immigration. Or maybe think it in your position context as this, you are a rural folk with a family who want to move out into the big cities for a better living condition and discover lots of opportunities awaiting there, then when you're trying to migrating there and entering the big city, the city police stops you and inspect you, and then tell you're forbidden from entering to the city for bureaucratic issue, and then you are being taken into their special confinement complex to keep people who have problems in entering the city, really lucky if the facility is a well-maintained and sanitized and grant you free access to interact and communicate with your family members that are also following to move out with you, but what if you don't have those perks at all? You are isolated, couldn't know what happen with your family, being treated poorly since have sub-standard service there, that's why the idea of using concentration camp might be much worse than being imprisoned since at least if you are imprisoned, your family might not be taken into custody in the jail as well and still be able to communicate in daily or weekly basis.",

He's a propagandist paid by billionaires to spread lies and bad faith talking points to brainwash people into a false radical right narrative, he's also PAINFULLY unfunny. But the thing about Sargon is that he isn't doing this just for the money. He doesn't have corporate donors. He legitimately believes this shit 100% and is doing this as an act of passion, and he's said abhorrent things that not even Steven would say, for example:\n\n\n\"I wouldn't even rape you,\" to multiple women, saying in his videos that they're \"too ugly to rape,\" and some of them were political figures, I think. And multiple other things at that level. And now he's saying that these people WANT to be in ICE camps, and that these kids aren't suffering. FUCK YOU, Sargon. Please, get off the internet FFS.",

However I mean what I said that actions done on the southern border to promote white jobs in the US seems like the same evil logic used for destroying Jewish businesses in Kristallnacht. \n \nBut as you say- evil is subjective. And in this case of kids in cages, I really hope what you and I consider evil are the same. Biblical interpretations could be split, because as you mentioned interpretations are hard to change rather than impossible, but let's agree that it's bad?\n\n\n\nI'm a little confused about why you think that just because I am not the absolute judge of good and evil that I shouldn't call people \"borderline fascists\" (remember, the first comment you commented on?). You are under a reaaaallly weird impression that I want to kill and silence these people. I do think we should take the words of borderline fascists with a grain of salt. Maybe we're actually in agreement on that , but what started this is that in your first comment I replied to you said that moderates listen to the extremes and in your second reply that most people have good reasons and we should acknowledge that- and here is where I push back. Sure view all evidence, but appraise it and if their reason is bad call them out on it.\n\n\nBecause if you can't interpret things as good and bad and then call people out for bad stuff, you're going to be really bad at following the Bible.",

I gave examples like Adultery, Drinking, Drugs and yes Fornication. \n\nIf you are personally offended by my stance because it might hit close to home then it's doesn't matter. Fornication leads to Bastard Children (Again you may not care about a proper lineage of family created by marriages but your opinion is irrelevant) Children growing without Parental Figures or even Aborted if the Fornicators decide to. That's enough reasons to be against Fornication. Fornication is only used to satisfy a temporary urge and it has zero consequences given you aren't in a marriage contract and you can simply leave if anything unwanted happens or maybe it was a one night fling which makes it more awful because it makes the people look like a toy for satisfaction and not a person to be loved.",

        "text": "@mattmattmatt131313 More people should learn about language implicatures. If a ship´s first mate had written in a log \"Today it was a good day, the captain is not drunk\". The implicit meaning in that sentences is that most days he is drunk and then the Captain would be very upstet. It can be very well that the captain is a sober man and what he wrote would be true, but then he wouldn´t have a reason to put that information because it is irrelevant. If you write something like \"I wouldn´t even rape you\" there a few implicatures: the first is \"you are not worthy of rape (the \"even\"), which is one of the worse things you can say to another person. It means I see as having so few worth as a human being that I wouldn´t been defile myself with you by raping you.The other implicature is \"I would rape you if the circumstances were different, so \"if you were a little more attractive, for example, I would consider raping you to not be beneath me\". Sargon might not have wanted to convey those meaning, but those are the meaning conveye in that \"joke\", which fuck, those are some of the worst thoughts you can direct to another human being and totally lacking any semblance of empathy. You can say the media misrepresented what he said and he in no way meant to say that the Captain was a drunk man, that it was a joke and in no way an attack on the Captain, but he wrote what he wrote and probably he new what he was writing. So, ehre the same, either Carl is so stupid and doesn´t know how sentences in his native langauge work (which is a posibility, I won´t deny it) or he purposefully threw one of the most demeaning things you can to a person. Given that later he said \"If I had a few beers I could cave in.\" I would pick the second (but I won´t rule out the first, both can be true at the same tim).",

        "text": "@saoirsecameron - I can't speak for the majority of Americans of Native American descent. But the majority of my close relatives don't fervently oppose \"illegal immigration\" of Central and South Americans. I have one Fox News uncle, out of 5 uncles and 1 aunt, who might. And then I have some distant Fox News relatives who probably do.\n\nThe rest of us have empathy or sympathy for people who are fleeing violence and/or poverty. And we notice the hypocrisy of of people getting so bent out of shape over legal formalities, considering what the U.S., Great Britain, France, Spain, etc. and some of their people did to Native Americans in what is now the U.S. And then, of course, the Trump has even implemented the policy of treating all lawful asylum seekers as illegal immigrants and separating them from their children if they have any. But these people aren't as upset about the Trump violating the U.S. Constitution and international law and separating children from their parents as they are about regular people crossing the border illegally (which is just a misdemeanor, anyway).",

Oh wait, I see, what you are trying to do. You actually just don't want immigration if you think making a pathway to citizenship/residency easier is \"open borders\".",

Compare that to 3,100 cases of fraudulent claims being made by migrants over an entire year (these claims don't just include migrants bringing unrelated children with them to the border, but stuff like migrants lying about their age, etc.) and it's really hard to see where your 1 in 3 number comes from. \n\nSeriously, if you have the study just link it, it can't be that hard.",

One way wants to structure everything, one want's to structure nothing. In one you get too centralized organizations up for the power grab (left), one leds to no opposition to the most powerful (right). In the end it doesn't matter. Democracy and freedom are a delicate marblegame and it takes energy to take the marble in the middle such that it allows us to  keep things like humanity and compassion, which are the first things dictators, left or right, wanna take from you because if they succed you become their accomplice.\n\n1. America has sled so far to the right that concentration camps become a thing. Could it be the left? No... they are not in charge and also the main shtick of the governing partyin USA  is freedom at all cost (including freedom). Freedom however needs boundaries. Structures on the other Hand need adaptability. \n2. The very first thing a dictator of any of both kind would do is point at the other side,  scream BUT the Leeeft... ( ...the Riiighht)  to distract from their own misdeeds. Of course they also need their accomplices, which do it for them.\n\nSo... i answer the implicit question in your post, even though it was whataboutism: Your point is valid, however not in the moment. If the marblegame tilts heavy to the right already, pushing it even further won't help. USA and other countries have pulled so far right already that they start asking of their citizens to forget their human core values. Don't become an accomplice. Thats the basic message you should also get from the video. Compassion needs energy to be kept up, like all good thing, but it is also the one thing to hold on in order not to be manipulated. It's your personal inner trust center to cling to. If people ask of you to accept inhumanities, they are the bad guys.",

You have to actually show how the two cultures are different from each other in ways that are relevant to the matter at hand.

You could argue that anglo-american culture is more individualistic than german culture and the individual traditionally holds more power over the state (except when they are black and enslaved, I guess). You could also say that anglo-american culture is more profit-oriented (by virtue of its individualism) and a genocide or at least abuse of power against minorities is more likely, if it profits those in charge. \n\nI haven't seen Sargon's response video and I'm not gonna bother, but I highly doubt that he made these or similar arguments. \"We are different\" is not an argument, if you don't show how these differences are relevant.",

They won't make the connection or they'll be dead before any of really bad effects on people in their region or country become undeniable.\n\nWith vehicle emissions, fuel economy, etc., they're almost certainly not going to notice the bad effects. Even if they have to spend more money on fuel, it's not likely to take a huge additional chunk of their money, and they'll just pay and carry more debt if necessary - probably even still buying SUV's if that's the type of vehicle they want.\n\nModern society allows a lot of people to be very irresponsible and childish, whereas they probably would've been more likely to feel the negative consequences of such behavior in the past without modern technology, so many government services, and so many people trying to make our lives better.",

Hell it's why I'm more of a centrist now. I still am against illegal immigration but I never understood why they had to separate the kids and why the right made a big deal of defending it. Honestly a lot of right wing talkers on YouTube always make it seem like all the problems in the us of a is the lefts fault. Honestly it's just radicals in general who've been tearing this country apart. I honestly have started to move slightly more towards the middle after some people started really pushing that white replacement theory which I think is really gonna just fuel a race war. Ironically the youtuber that really made me question my right wing stance was American Krogan. He made a video called Wokenstien where he talked about how wolfenstine Youngblood was a bad video game but the part that freaked me out was where because Nazis in a fictional video game weren't portrayed 100% accurately he got super upset and basically defending the Nazis because they didn't like communism, almost going as far as saying they should have won wwii and that because the allies firebombed german cities we can't criticize what they did because of that. It was that day I realized that the radical right ain't any better and that there is a reason to fear both. Hell it's why I'm voting for tulsi instead of Trump. Trump keeps changing his mind on shit and keeps shilling to Israel. Honestly the tribalism and divide in this country is reaching a fucking boiling point and it's gonna explode and I'm worried we may just become 1920s Germany.",

Their mugs, which each man had brought from home, were grouped around the kettle on the hearth of the central furnace which incidentally heated the irons and knives.\n\nThey had legends on them like A Present From the Holy Grotto of Ossory, or To The World’s Greatest Daddy. Most of them were chipped, and no two of them were the same.\n\nAnd there were the postcards on the wall. It was traditional that, when an inquisitor went on holiday, he’d send back a crudely colored woodcut of the local view with some suitably jolly and risqué message on the back. And there was the pinned-up tearful letter from Inquisitor First Class Ishmale “Pop” Quoom, thanking all the lads for collecting no fewer than seventy-eight obols for his retirement pension and the lovely bunch of flowers for Mrs. Quoom, indicating that he’d always remember his days in No. 3 pit, and was looking forward to coming in and helping out any time they were short-handed.\n\n\nAnd it all meant this: that there are hardly any excesses of the most crazed psychopath that cannot easily be duplicated by a normal, kindly family man who just comes in to work every day and has a job to do.\"\n\n\n-- Terry Pratchett, from Small Gods",

Not even during Japanese internment did we separate families from each other. Several children have died living in the inhumane conditions at these concentration camps. Sargon created a straw man argument and then proceeded to tear it down. He then argued a logical fallacy by basically saying that if they're not as bad as Nazi Germany, which is a unique experience to Germany, then shut the fuck up. The logical fallacy is that, you don't need to embark on a journey of racial extermination in order to treat other human beings in cruel and inhumane ways. He completely missed the entire point of the video. He spoke about England's history and how it is fundamentally different from Germany's racial extermination. Different yes, but still evil. Britain's quest for world domination killed untold millions of people and subjugated millions more. There are a lot of different ways  a government can be unfairly cruel to other humans. What Trump is doing on our border is cruel, unnecessary and clearly racist, as he has targeted American citizens just because of their skin color, regardless of immigration status. Sargon proved this video's entire point by trying to normalize this kind of evil and racist behavior. Sargon is not American and honestly doesn't know anything about America. His videos are filled with misinformation and straight propaganda... he knows his audience and has fully sold out. This is coming from someone who used to watch him a lot.",

You people mean nazi concentration camps which Sargon talked about. You created this retarded argument, now own it. We're not talking about Japanese concentration camps, we're not talking about german concentration camps from the 1920's. The context is clearly nazi concentration camps. \nWhat do you mean inhumane conditions? We know what conditions they have/. There are enough photos and videos. They get food and shelter. The children are seperated from their parents because a recent study showed that 30% of the people coming in with these children aren't related. Sargon also showed it in his video. So there is a good reason. It's not done to be ''an evil nazi''. It's done to protect these children. If you don't like it don't come to the US the illegal way.\nHow is England or US evil for protecting it's borders? It's not their fault that people come to them. You can't just let people come though your border unoppossed. You need a system to look who these people are. Are they MS-13 gang members or normal people who want to legally immigrate? But that makes you a nazi in Three Arrows mind.\nHow is it racist cruel and (enter other buzzword)? At the border they literally stop EVERYBODY. Regardless of race. It's not racist to keep illegal immigrants out. He has said numerous times that legal immigrants are good for the society. But illegal immigrants are bad. Nothing wrong with that.\nIt seems to me that you don't know anything about America or even about the words you're using. Reffering to racism when talking about stopping illegal immigration is just ridiculous.\nWell what is propaganda in his videos but not Three Arrow's videos? Sargon literally just wants nations to exist with borders, have controlled legal migration and laws like free speech. While you leftists consistently try to push for your retarded open borders ideas and hate speech laws. And when you have no argument you call Sargon or others a racist. Sounds good, doesn't work. Think of a better argument why controlling your borders is racist and hatefull. Go back to your university and ask your marxist professor for some more anti border leftist propaganda to counter my arguments :)",

Well I do find it hilarious when reading a great deal of opion pieces, actual articles, hyperfocus on the Atlantic slave trade in education (Even though the Arabian slave trade was more expansive & led to a great amount of cruelty & loss of life). Whilst they act as sicophants for a person who shares the same family name as a truly messed up individual, that inidividual being the Conquistador Cortez. \n\nOkay other flaws in your argument. Using tokenism of the acts of The Quakers to, what shall I call it, reverse virtue signal, yeah I lioe that.\n\nWell i happen to have been born & raised in the UK. Britai was the first nation to employ anti-slavery laws the world.has ever seen. These laws were introduced by William the Conqueror in the early 1100s. We are also a nation that committed half our Naval power to ending the Atalntic slave trade  (We had the most poweful Navy in the world at the time).\n\nNo my dear. It seems like you are missing a gteat deal of information. Of course I don't believe it will lead anywhere but to you creating rhetorically insufficient arguments.  I certainly don't believe it will predict any \"supremacist\" views. Which interestingly is about the most delusional thing said in our exchange so far.\n\nMaybe you could explain the behaviours that would lead from \"not having enough infor\" to \"holding supremacist views\". You will of course need to formulate an argument that would guarantee the outcome being a \"supremacist view\".\n\nGood luck with that.\n\nPS In b4 the length of my comment being used as evidence of an emotional state.

Srsly, that's some trippy head games you are trying to play.  \n\nI mean,  I've read every book written by a slave or freed slave.  There's a reason no one wanted to be sold in North Carolina or any of the other big cotton plantations (but NC was particularly scary to any slave on the auctioning block)... because they were well known as being particularly cruel. Do you comprehend the level of cruelty involved in \"breaking\" another human being? \n\nIn my mind,  the white slave owners were really fucking cruel - as cruel as any others, particularly plantation owners.. It's almost a requirement in order to feel entitled to OWN another human...  It's unjustifiable... but it happened and instead of getting all butthurt about your white supremacy bubble being burst- why not just take it as a piece of history ALL humans can learn from to avoid repeating? \n\nTrying to minimize it doesn't do anyone any favors.  If confronting reality head on makes me a \"SJW\" (a meaningless term thrown at anyone you perceive as the \"enemy\") - so be it. I'd rather be a social justice warrior than an ANTI - SJW.

There's nothing original about working class ppl falling for those bullshit seeds planted by the people living in wealth.  People like Donald Trump.

Auschwitz wasn't just \"one big death camp\", the Death part was Auschwitz II, or Auschwitz-Birkenau, the rest of the Auschwitz facilities had different purposes, but \"Death Camps\" were purpose build and VERY different from concentration camps.\n\nA concentration camp is any facility to \"concentrate\" and hold a specific type of people for more effective processing by local authorities...\n\nI mean, the brits invented the concept back in the collonial times, I bet they didn't equate them to \"only use for mass murder\".\n\nBut I guess using the grossly misinformed definition is the new MO for the supposedly \"well educated, fact based\" society that prides itself on it's \"impirical logic\" and \"facts\" or something.\n\nI don't know why someone would call the detention facilities concentration camps, but they are technically not wrong.

        "text": "@fulcrum2951 it's a common phenomenon. Psychology is fascinating to most people, since it offers insight, so naturally psychological terms (like depression, anxiety, even schizophrenia, etc.) spread among laymen and women and the meaning gets distorted. I personally welcome the dialogue. The more people are open to discussion, the more likely they can change and take control over their future. As for the phenomenon, that nowadays \"everyone\" claims to have e.g. depression and anxiety: it doesn't bother me. I only feel sorry for those who _really_ suffer from it (got properly diagnosed and are in treatment for those conditions) since they put in the effort and work on their mental health. People who claim those clinical labels for themselves but weren't diagnosed and are not in treatment, just make others with those diagnoses look bad imo. It's like claiming to have a toothache, but not going to a dentist and rather bringing it up as an excuse for most things. Mental health takes work, just like physical health. If someone doesn't want to work on it, they should refrain from using clinical terms... just my 2 cents 💝",

        "text": "@bonda_racing3579 What you call \"crony capitalism\" or \"corporatism\" is still capitalism, it's just no longer competitive or \"free market\" capitalism. Capitalists still own and control most of the businesses, the factories, the banks, the land, etc. etc., and they still withhold that control of capital to coerce labor from those who own less property and to extract surplus from that labor to make a profit. Under these conditions, even this \"degenerated\" form of capitalism is still capitalism.\n\nFurthermore, under an initially competitive capitalism, i.e. under conditions that have rarely been observable since before the gilded age, when (plundered) natural resources and land were still abundant in North America, even in a scenario where all firms start off on approximately equal footing, firms that make the most profits and grow the most enter later periods with asymmetric advantages and gradually increase their market shares until in the absence of sufficient regulation against it they become oligopolistic firms, and barriers to entry by newcomers are nigh-insurmountable. This was one of the features that emerged from the gilded age, from the 1870s until monopolies and oligopolies were partly \"busted\" in the 1910s, the same period during which these increasingly corporate businesses, along with imperialist capitalist governments in North America and western Europe, desperately scrambled to carve out sections of African, South American, and Pacific territory for themselves to exploit as North American \"nova terra\" was nearly exhausted or already claimed.\n\nSince the beginning of the neoliberal period (early 1970s), we've seen the steady re-emergence of gilded-age oligopolistic conditions in the US. Again, somewhat competitive markets, closer to the ideal liberal conception of capitalism, after enough time degenerated again into oligopolistic conditions as earlier winners swallowed up newer smaller losers whole and all firms came to rely more heavily on greater exploitation through austerity at home (Keynesian deficit spending on social services was no longer \"sustainable\" from the perspective of sustaining profit growth - except military spending, of course) or through imperialism abroad (hence the continued military spending - easier to keep sweatshops and mines operating at gunpoint) to continue growing their profits, leading once again to what Marxists call \"late-stage\" capitalism.\n\nThis is the corrupt \"crony\" capitalism we're dealing with nowadays and have dealt with for the better share of the past century, one in which the most successful firms are those that were successful decades ago and snowballed into megalithic entities with internal economies larger than those of many developing nations (examples such as Disney and Amazon come to mind), one in which they've been able to successfully buy off politicians most of the time because the government answers to the interests of big capitalists firsts, small capitalists second, and the working class last. While extensive use of antitrust law to break up these almost-monopolistic entities (apparently what \"watchdogs\" like Elizabeth Warren want) would temporarily cripple their ability to dominate the market and lobby the government, under newly competitive conditions winners always eventually re-emerge and devour the losers. \n\nThe only permanent solution to this problem is to _nationalize_ these mega-corporations and place them under the control of their workers and the voters. Doing anti-trust every few decades is a neverending cycle; solving this requires accepting that these \"crony\" corps aren't going away and should instead be taken away from their crony capitalist owners, thereby embracing a socialist (or at the very least social-democratic) approach to this problem. Companies like Walmart and Amazon have in their pursuit of profit developed their own internal centrally-planned infrastructure; placing such infrastructure under democratic control, under the people's control, would allow people to democratically plan production and transportation of goods that are desperately needed but which aren't always profitable to give to people who are priced out of buying them.\n\nThe US is also uniquely positioned to attempt such nationalization because there is no US military to invade the US to shut it down and force privatization at gunpoint, or impose trade sanctions in retaliation like they've done to social democracies like Venezuela for taking similar measures. US soldiers would have to point their guns at their own fellow Americans to prevent it, and some of them may not be willing to do that.",

If that doesnt prove it, what does?\". \n\nPeople like this use racial self-aggrandisement at the expense of others in need to justify further mistreatment. Its a justification not to employ any empathy at all, that in itself should be a red flag, and not to reflect on ones own actions (like starving ones slave workers) that drove those people to that state in the first place, as well as fallaciously negating the effects of the power imbalance you are trying to justify, namely the people you are responsible for being responsible for actions they have to take out of need, but somehow NOT being responsible for your own response to defend said power structure that also happens to serve you, even if said response is sadistic overreach.\n\nIn my eyes its the ultimate loss of humanity, and yet it is so banal and easy. I mean how low can a human being get? \n\nIts a slippery slope towards more dehumanising policies because it negates any reaponaibility and reflection on part of the perpetrators. And this philosophy is 100% applicable to the justifications on the situation on the southern US border, hence the comparison to the Nazis concentration camp system. The are carried by the same general malice. Mistreatment for mistreatments sake, justified by the logical conclusion of the last mistreatment and negating ones own role in it.",

Also, what's this, concentration camps not being, \"logistically viable\"? There doesn't really need to be any logistics for them, since the premise of them is to make life miserable, which means depriving those kept thereof sanitary, working facilities, and a half-decent standard of living, which many of them do. \n\nAnd yes, people can call those who think that ICE is doing a great job, despite brutalizing migrants, racist, or calling those who support the critically under-funded camps xenophobic/racist, because you would have to have some sort of sub-conscious hate of migrants and/or brown people to think that's okay. \n\nThere are plenty of other ways to handle migration, but building and maintaining a country-long wall (with what funds?), and placing migrants in disgusting conditions is not one of them.

        "text": "Michael Vander Wal the whole point of this video is that the concentration camps committed their atrocities very slowly, to the point that there’s no clear distinction between the Germany that committed genocide and the Germany that was a healthy civil society that respected everyone’s rights. It emphasizes the fact that holocaust historians don’t start their studying with the first Jewish death at the hands of the nazis or even when the Nazi party was first formed, but rather when German society began to lay the groundwork that allowed Nazi rhetoric to be seen as not too extreme. The phrase “never again“ doesn’t mean “something this horrible will never again happen” but rather “we must remain vigilant and oppose any and all pivots towards fascism so these atrocities will never again happen”. Claiming that any country has “zero chance” of devolving into a genocidal dictatorship is antithetical to wanting to prevent future genocidal dictatorships. You can’t meaningfully oppose fascism while also operating under the assumption that ur country can never become fascistic.",

        "text": "@paaklapi The most effective antidote to fascist politics is explicitly socialist politics - socialism seeks to meet the needs of working class people frequently getting the short end of the stick under liberalism, while fascists offer false cures for those same needs. Both left and right have the potential to flourish when the status quo becomes unbearable, as it did for Germans after the Treaty of Versailles cratered the German economy. In 1919 German socialists attempted a revolution like the one that had just created the Soviet Union, but social democrats betrayed the German revolution, assassinating leading figures such as Rosa Luxemburg early and (temporarily) preserving the newly formed liberal Weimar republic.\n \nWith revolutionary socialists incapacitated and social democrats insufficiently able to address German workers' problems, Nazis were able to exploit their growing angry sentiment. The German social democrats were eventually falsely branded \"social fascists\" by the (justifiably) angry Comintern under Stalin, so an effective antifascist coalition failed to materialize when it was needed most. This allowed the Nazis to win power by blaming scapegoats such as the Jewish and Roma diaspora on the problems of capitalism. In countries like the US, UK, Hungary, Brazil, and India, we're now on a similar path, for lack of sufficiently influential explicitly socialist political forces with humane answers to the problems created by neoliberal economic policy in the aftermath of the 2008 global recession.",

In fact most of these points by Sargon illuminate why learning how the Nazi State worked should basically be mandatory, because people treat Nazi Ideology like an impossible snap of the fingers that drives people Fascist and bloodthirsty, instead of the systemic dismantling of Weimar democracy and one of the *first* parliamentary systems of its time (not to say the the Imperial diet was amazing or anything, but it does demonstrate just to what extent power was consolidated within the Nazi Regime).\n\nThe portrayal of systemic elimination as 'necessary' and not necessarily enjoyable is eerily mirrored in the talking points around the detention centers, the lines by which we define \"well we're just trying to figure out what's going on\" and \"well we're not killing them\" (funny how Sargon keeps using 'We' despite not being an American, in the administration or anything, almost as if he's referring to a wider group or something) , and clear categorization for a group where what that process entails is evidently afforded more lease, and more methods than would be acceptable with other groups, especially ones that subvert democratic processes that would once have been implacable, now become 'weak and indecisive' and have to therefore be maneuvered around. e.g. Executive Order 13769, 13768 and of course, the Separation of children at the border. Its even easier to do so with Immigration because they don't even have citizens rights to provide a buffer from such federal decisions.\n\nIts easy to see the failures of historical education on the Nazis when the bottom line for comparisons to Concentration camps is outright Industrial scale murder, and not identified by their inherent prerogative to contain a specific segment of a population, it hasn't been 100 years and yet, alot of the edifices of the Nazi Regime are viewed like Historical antiquities with no bearing on modern politics, because for most people the Nazi ideology starts and ends with the Holocaust, not the means by which a small outlier party within the Reichstag's parliament NSDAP party came to control every aspect of German society that had democratized not even 20 years ago",

        "text": "Eltaccos thank u for continuing ur streak of conflating the morality and effects of leftism with those of fascism. The “hostile actions” of communists against liberals and conservatives surmounts to calling out the racist people and structures in our society for their racism, protesting, and the occasional assault of an actual fascist who these supposedly innocent conservatives and liberals sympathize with more than the minorities whose lives are endangered by the mere existence of fascism. The “hostile actions” of fascists are literal acts of domestic terrorism, like the murder of heather heyer, the unabomber, the Oklahoma City bombing, etc etc etc. To conflate the two is akin to saying the black panthers and the kkk were both violent. The kkk’s violence was lynching innocent black ppl, while the black panthers violence was opposing racism literally “by any means necessary”. And ur whole “means-justify-the-ends, but ur means aren’t effective” statement is ridiculous and falls apart given any historical analysis. If u think that being nice to fascists is enough to change their minds then I’ve got a bridge to sell you. If you think that conservatives and liberals will cede immoral capitalist social hierarchies if we just debate them politely enough or appeal to their morals earnestly enough then I’d recommend you take a real deep look into any civil rights movement that’s ever had success. The events that change the course and perception of those movements, and that are actually pertinent to history, aren’t the kum ba yah drum circles that make everyone feel all warm and fuzzy inside. The events that matter are the ones that are ugly and uncomfortable. The ones that disrupt civil society. The ones that, sadly, often result in injuries on both sides. The slow transition from monarchistic to democratic society was likely absolutely terrifying to the monarchs. But we don’t care how the monarchs felt ab it, bc monarchy is an immoral system. Ur essentially asking leftists to ignore this historical precedent of demanding change in order to see change in favor of the tactic that the democrats have been using, unsuccessfully, for three decades. It doesn’t matter how many hours of debate are had in the halls of Congress, nor does it matter how many facts and data u whip out in order to support ur position. The fascists will never compromise. And by assuming they might change their minds or that you’ll humiliate them into submission with a sick debunking in front of the public, you’ve just given them a megaphone to broadcast their propaganda to a whole nation of extremely gullible ppl.",

    "text": "What i never understood is why people are always so insistent that we don't \"humanize\" the nazis and the people of Germany before and during WW2.\n\nI'm sorry to break it to you all but the nazis and the people of Germany were human. They were not some kind of lovecraftian abominations or inhuman monsters. They were for the most part regular people who allowed themselves to be hooked by hate and extremist ideals.\n\nPeople always do that, when something horrific happens they always want to push it away and disassociate themselves from it, claiming that the people responsible are monsters or otherwise \"not human\".\n\nThe way i see it, that act of disassociating from horrible events is harmful because it denies one of the most fundamental facts about being human - that we do horrible things. Repeatedly and consistently. \n\nHuman history is filled with evidence that we do horrible things, yet we want to delude ourselves that we don't. All of those horrible events were not us, it was \"the bad-guys\", \"the monsters\" or \"the evil ones\". We're the good guys, see. We're nothing like them. Right?\n\nBut here's the thing - if you manage to convince yourself that you're fundamentally \"good\" and that your beliefs are right and true, then do you think you would notice if it started to seem like you were not? How far would you have to go before you started questioning yourself? Could you kill someone if you were convinced it was for a good cause? Could you perhaps even kill many people? Could you look away when people were being tortured or raped if you believed it to be necessary or that they somehow deserved it? Do you think that a criminal sees themselves as a monster or even a bad guy? Do you think that the people of Germany did?\n\nIn recognizing nazis as human, we don't make their actions any less reprehensible. What it does however allow us to do is to accept the fact that we are all capable of both good and bad, and that it's thus even more important to try our absolute hardest to do good. \n\nWith the exception of very few, people are not born good or evil. Hell, outside of human societies, concepts like good and evil or even morality itself probably don't exist. It is our actions and the beliefs and ideologies that we allow ourselves to adopt that defines whether our peers see us as good or bad. And unfortunately we are all highly susceptible to suggestion.\n\nWith this in mind, let me propose an idea. I say that we stop disassociating from the nazis. We stop vilifying them and painting them up to be monsters or inhuman. We don't excuse them, but we own their actions and recognize that they are part of us. We use this knowledge as a tool to check ourselves and make sure that we are not following in their footsteps. Because it is my belief that when a person is actively aware that they have the capacity to do serious harm that they are the most likely to try and do good instead.",

Many people campaign for harsher and longer punishments for all sorts of different crimes but more and more studies show that oftentimes harsh and long sentences either have no positive effect or have outright negative ones.\n\n\nAs for your view on what laws are there to do, i disagree. Laws are not there to \"punish evil\" or \"reward good\". Laws are there to outline what kind of behaviours that society will and will not accept. That's it. It's basically a glorified list of what is and isn't allowed under various circumstances. It's not the law's job to determine what is \"good\" and what is \"evil\". If anything i'd say that it's important that the law and those who enforce it try to remain as neutral as possible. \n\n\n\n\"Good\" and \"Evil\" are at their core emotional concepts. They are based on how a person's behaviour makes the people around them feel. If people love you, you are good. If people hate you, you are evil. Having a system like the law that is used to determine the lives and futures of living breathing people be based on something as unstable as emotions is a recipe for disaster.\n\n\nThe law should be based on observable and logical fact. Things that can be proven to be true. For example - killing people causes harm to the victim and the people closest to them, therefore it's illegal. Speeding in/on a motorized vehicle increases risk of traffic accidents that have serious consequences for everyone involved, therefore it's illegal.  etc. etc.\nDoes this mean that a person who has committed one or several of these crimes is necessarily \"evil\" or that a person that has never committed a crime in their life is necessarily \"good\"? Of course not. Which is why it's not the job of the law to judge whether someone or something is good or evil.",

Is following the law moral? If not, is it moral to over throw the government and eliminate all borders? Is it even possible to do this without cleansing 100s of millions of people? \n My answer is borders are moral. Border law is moral. \n Morality is very subjective. Everyone has a different idea.  We ALL decided violence against humans who don't deserve it is wrong. Enforcement of the law requires violence so some violence will be permitted If resistance is met. So laws have to be moral. \n But aside from all of this. Humans have ALWAYS fought over borders. ALL borders exist because of war. Humans are very territorial like animals.  So the land and resources will be fought for. The humans can be just as wild as the animals. \nWhen we look at society, we have way fewer violent deaths than 100 years ago. Society is good. No one is gonna kill millions of people in the USA. But the USA might be doing deportations.  That's within the law and borders. If there are no borders... there can be no social welfare programs granted from the government, for if there are no borders, there is no government.",

When people break the law you have to have a mechanism that detains them and such a mechanism is always going to have problem. There's no detention facilities, jails, prisons anywhere in the world that aren't subject to things like mistreatement of people, deaths, etc. When you're dealing with people who do not respect the rule of law you unfortunately are left with no other option than to detain them with force, which leads to injuries and sometimes death. Obviously we should strive to make these places as safe as we can do with the budgets that we have, but ironically it's the sheer volume of illegal immigration that means detention camps are often temporary structures and facilities which are not staffed or funded as well as we'd ideally like them to be. It's the illegal behaviour of others that cause these problems, if people simple followed the rule of law none of this would be required.

You know, the ones that didn't found a party to dismantle it. \nI think it is very, very hard to understand a country as an outsider. Confronted with american/british/other european countries politics I usually just express bewilderment and move on when I realize I can't see it from their view point because of my own bias. \nAnd then there are people on both sides who make videos on it.",

The closest thing the English have to a 'volk' are Angles and Saxons, but even then a lot of English are not Anglo-Saxon including my English relatives who look more like Spaniards than Germans. In The Netherlands where the other half of my family is from there is a concept of a volk that is the same as in Germany, which is racial/ethnic and about blood relation, the Dutch anthem even mentions that the Dutch are of German blood.

Trump is pretty much doing what Business democrats were doing in the 80's because that is what he was politically and his rhetoric didn't much change from back then.\nTough on crime, tough on illegal immigration, tax cuts, making trade deals etc...\nWhat Three Arrows is doing and what other left wing youtuber's are doing is nothing but pure sophistry and ignorance of history and not only that but modern left wingers tend to whitewash American bigoted history by focusing only on National Socialist Germany.\nModern  left wing values from the West were pretty uncommon in the 1930's/1940's  even among left wingers.\nEven Anarchists were bigoted against other races and the Jews because Anarchism was created by racists and anti-semites. Proudhon called for the extermination of Jews and Bakunin was the one who was pushing the idea that Marxism is a Jewish conspiracy.\n\n\nHistory is something we use to explain to people what did happen and not a tool for propaganda in order to manipulate people in order to get emotional response from them.\nEverything Three Arrows said about America today in this video can be applied to America before Trump so there is no need to talk about National Socialist Germany.",

But nationalism will eventually, in certain conditions, lead to  what I call, mystic nationalism.

Because The Third Reich built a new Germany with new Germans, but has nothing to do with USSR attempt, but with forging history to create the wishful thinking, ocultist utopia saw as the German past. \n\nThe view that you are a special nation with a mission, while others are inferior, unreliable is at the base of this construct, and Sargon is over his head with this view.

I have been able to build bridges with some folks like that(maybe not super extreme that way but still).Idk if the culture of assimilation is there anymore which makes those folks really scared(it may not be fear but it seems that to me) \n\nI can understand in part  the white westerner's concerns because they see what the europeans did to the natives when the europeans refused to assimilate so they fear the same will be done to them. \n\nI don't get it often anymore(depending on where i go in the west) but during the most recent M.E refugee crisis i had started getting comments like ''are you one of them?Eventually they told me they meant ''muslims terrorists'''  and it was just .....''sigh...idiot'' \n\nI'm born in the middle east so it's not out of the norm, but it's just an unpleasantness.I could rant on this forever.\n\nlastly, there's no doubt many illegals aliens(i'm using the legal term to avoid any  problems with my language) and many very well may be hispanic(because of the southern border). Yet the assumption of them being illegal has always bothered me (hispanics in general). I do believe however that once one comes to the west (or in this case North america) there needs to be a path to citizenship say give them 30 days to apply for citizenship or something. \n\nMany assume malice and i'm sure there are those that come to NA to exploit the system but to assume all do that is nonsense.

I pointed out that Sargon didn't say that. You then shifted your position to arguing that Sargon equated the cry of the clip (which you described as a 'cry of anguish' resulting from a separation from his/her parents) to a child's childish need for toys or snacks. I then argued that even if the child did cry out of anguish, there wouldn't be much that could be done about it; after all, it's a common practice to separate people who have committed a crime from their children.\n\n\nYou'll notice I haven't shifted the goal posts once.

And then they simply stay, after their visa has expired. How is a wall going to help against that? And the vast majority of those who cross the land border do so through border crossing stations. After all, that's where the roads go through. The only ones crossing unmonitored stretches of the border are individual families, and those aren't the ones causing trouble anyway. The _criminal_ elements that Trump is faking concern about, come in by plane, boat or border stations - legally. So what's the point of paying for an expensive plug for areas that won't really benefit from them?",

        "text": "@TheUrbanSimian \nSingle parent families suffer risks due to having, on average, lower incomes and less support for child care/time to spend with children (usually due to needing to work longer hours to keep up with expenses). It is extremely important to recognize that this is a risk caused by financial factors primarily, not some kind of natural law. Children of single parents may not experience anything worse than children with two (or more for extended families) parents when income and childcare/time able to be spent with the child are accounted for, and children with more than one parent experience similar outcomes under similar financial and time constraints.\n\nStudies on the children of same sex parents indicate they do just as well or occasionally marginally better than children of opposite sex parents. Children of same sex parents do not suffer psychologically due to the combination of their parents sex. Some do experience the negative effects of discrimination against their parents, but the solution to this is not to blame the parents any more than you blame parents for children suffering from discrimination of their parents' race, religion, or age.",

If you suspended your thinking and hardened your heart at that point, then you'd be on the same page as Sargon.\n\n\nHowever, any idiot knows there's more to the story.\n\n\nWe also know that children have been separated from their parents. I'm sure you're not an idiot, but nevertheless in case you didn't know, this is traumatic for children and furthermore in contravention of the UN Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child (pity the US is not as signatory though). We also know conditions in the facilities are \"egregious\" (NY Times) and \"squalid\" (The Guardian). The comparison of  children crying due to being disciplined by their parents with children crying in detention would be a laughable false equivalence if it weren't such as sad incitement on how some people rationalise cruelty.\n\n\nWhat's the title of this video again?

Probably not. I'm gonna guess and say you'll find some other reason justifying this cruelty.\n\n\nTo answer the question on your sister, I'm glad you asked. Don't worry. Children cry all the time. Your sister isn't a Nazi (Unless she also happens to detain minority kids in concentration camps then maybe worry. But even then, only worry if they're screaming uncontrollably - otherwise it's impossible to tell from not getting what they just. Manipulative little bastards that they are).",

Neoliberalism, for example, agrees with the values of the Right and is not part of the Left. \n\nSo do \"authoritarian\" and \"antiauthoritarian\" have agreed upon meanings. Carl, for example, claims to be part of the antiauthoritarian Right. However, it has been documented that extreme antiauthoritarians can be \"triggered\" into becoming extremely authoritarian. Carl (partly at least because he is dependent on his authoritarian base) has been carrying water for authoritarian practices during the Trump administration.

They just see it getting spread around on gamergate crap and Pepe macros and think it's a synonym for \"libtard\" or \"SJW\" or something. But a political scientist using the term absolutely knows what it means, and they use it on purpose. It's a example of a dog whistle. There is no other accepted meaning for \"cultural Marxist.\" If you use the term, either you don't know what it means and just pretend that you do to sound smart, or you do know what it means. There is no middle ground where you know a different meaning. If you are talking about actual Marxists, you will just call them \"Marxists.\"",
