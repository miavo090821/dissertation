record on computer all right and we're off so um yeah so we we're doing this interview because we me and eddie started this this journal that i think the goal of it is to be able to bring to working-class people a socialist narrative in a way that's non-alienating as some of the other leftist platforms are so part of that is being able to both grab elements from academia marxist philosophy politics and also have elements that can give a concise example of what the working class experience is like and specifically um industrial work and since we're based in in the midwest uh we we called this whole shebang midwest marks so we figured uh as as you're known in the labor club circles as the embodiment of the proletariat that you'd be a perfect subject for for an interview on what being an industrial worker is like what being a part of the union is like in the midwest um so yeah do you would you like to give yourself an a short introduction of who you are and kind of what you do sure um so my name is stephen meyer stephen louis meyer would have been november of 2018 i hired into john deere which means i'm a member of the united auto workers union which was founded in 1935 john deere is mainly agricultural plant but they do make construction and forestry equipment as well so john deere dubuque would be a little bit of both a little bit of construction and forestry and a little bit of agricultural so i worked when i first started there i was in production driving a fork truck in the backhoe department and then shortly thereafter i was working on skid steers which tobacco and skid steer would both be considered construction equipment and they're also two of john deere's biggest sellers customers in russia global brazil all over the place wasn't my first union my first union was actually the campaign workers guild um so that experience uh being a campaign worker organizing um ourselves into a union because at the time we weren't getting paid 15 an hour while the candidate that i was working for was talking about a 15 minimum wage so we unionized ourselves uh ended up getting uh compensated fairly well compared to other state-run campaigns in the state at that time um so chalk that up as a success for the working class not only for ourselves but for kind of just the whole movement of not just saying fight for 15 but actually fighting for it in a real meaningful way so that was where i got started with uh i guess you could say my infatuation was wanting to be in a union or around union organizing in some capacity i had a cousin who for years was telling me to apply at john deere i never thought that i would get hired because i lacked the quote-unquote experience um but turns out that uh pretty much any job where you punch the clock is just like any other job where you punch the clock so that's where the union kind of comes in you know once you're in there even if you lack experience it's pretty hard for them to fire you so you're you're awarded the opportunity to fail a few times before that boss just comes grabs you snatches you and throws you out of the building so i mean just starting right there walking in the door at john deere nervous that i didn't have any experience quote unquote it was very comforting knowing that you know there was some guidelines that had to be followed that i could familiarize myself with and it wasn't just some company memo that didn't really mean anything it was actually a binding contract um so i mean just that uh stress off of your of your plate as an individual um meant a lot to me so in return you know you gotta you gotta do uh you know what what you gotta do as a union brother or sister or friend um so i started going to the meetings and been doing that kind of stuff you know uh started the labor for bernie and dubuque organized around same same kind of issues spoke about labor at one of bernie's rallies here in town in front of like 700 people um so i mean john deere in the in the midwest i mean it i mean i'm sure you guys know and i'm sure anybody watching this knows john deere is a big deal you know they're they're a brand like no other um so from kind of a outward view of working at john deere in the midwest it does come with some sort of status i suppose but that isn't really how i look at it i didn't get a job there because i wanted to tell people i worked at john deere i got a job there because i knew the uaw was there and i knew that moving forward at my age being almost 40 when i got hired there i couldn't take another job where my security was left up to if some supervisor decides whether or not they're gonna like me because of my age my sex my race whatever the case may be um you know so yeah that's that's one of the one of the things that me and eddie have been focusing on as for the site um that relationship between what's considered industrial or agricultural labor labor that's directly related to to the process of of production and the labor that comes after like like service jobs and stuff like that um would you mind speaking a little bit since you've been sort of in both um in both classes in within the working masses um what you see as the main difference between between being in an industrial or agricultural job and and um and being in a service job i mean really there isn't much of a difference so i mean you know i worked as a as a line cook for years and years it's the same concept as working on an assembly line you need to be able to communicate with the guy next to you everything that you're doing is dependent on what they're doing and vice versa um safety becomes an issue not just for yourself but for the guy standing next to you who you know standing above 165 degree fryer you know you don't want to be screwing up because he could get hurt so it's just same on assembly line you're not just looking out for yourself it becomes a team issue the the separation being is you know in the industrial world i mean the chances of you dying is a little bit higher than it is say in the service industry so there's a hazard you know factor but in terms of the camaraderie that needs to be built amongst the folks that are working those jobs it's it's the same um you know the the pay is obviously different but again you know that that really has no bearing on on what you have to do as a as a working-class individual in those situations to make sure that you're not only protecting yourself but your co-worker and nine times out of ten the boss is kind of in the way of that process really being the way it should be yeah no absolutely i um i think eddie eddie would agree as well that um one of the one of the focus that we really wanted to emphasize is uh that we feel like is missing on the left is is the focus of uh industrial and productive labor as as a tremendous source of power that is absolutely necessary in the building of socialism i think with uh with some of the influences that the u.s left has had from the new left elements which no longer really seeks uh that traditional working class um as an agent of revolution the the focus has been mainly on other sectors of the working masses so i think our project is not necessarily a rejection of that other part and so in so much as as just a focus of bringing to light on the immense power that's in industrial labor and agricultural labor and i think you're right to say that essentially the relationships between people the camaraderie um the solidarity between workers regardless of the workplace they're in is essentially always going to be there but one of the elements that we like to examine is how the relations of power manifest themselves in the different sections of of the working masses so in terms of of power and and what can bring like a a substantial shock to the economy um what differences do you see when when you were in in a service job or uh when you were in a plant in in or when you when you're in a plant in john deere um like essentially like if if there was if a strike were to happen within service jobs and if a strike were to happen within john deere a general strike where would you see the most influence taking place well i mean john deere at least here in dubuque if they went on strike that's essentially i mean i can't put a number on it you know but i'm sure it's a pretty large percentage of the you know consumer spending power that would be missing from the from the economy um whereas if the four or five burger kings or mcdonald's what have you if they went on strike there's not going to be any real dip at all so just that uh you know that buying power that comes from john deere um that could have a massive effect if uh you know there was ever such a thing as a wildcat strike in iowa um and it came from john deere that that would be a huge thing but uh you know i don't know how sustainable it would really be either because at the same point in time um which i think you guys were going to ask me about later was what i would like to see unions change and it's a good good time to bring that up is you know if i if we went on strike we're only getting a couple hundred dollars a week so it's about it's about like what's going on with this this pandemic right now folks are gonna lose that 600 bonus and they're going to be getting a couple hundred dollars a week it's kind of hard to focus on uh you know the dictatorship of the proletariat when you are trying to figure out where that next meal is going to come from so you can't really be out on the picket lines uh you know when you got a family to feed so i think that's where the unions really need to start making some some changes they do everything from uh what happens if the company comes after us standpoint instead of let's look after our membership first and then worry about what happens if the company comes after us so they all have these huge legal funds strike funds what have you but they're they're just very reluctant reluctant to ever really dip in there and make some real impactful you know the the auto workers could have went on strike for a year if their unions would have just paid them but instead they made a ton of unnecessary concessions because they had to get back to work so i you know that that's my my want and my need uh for the uaw is to step up and be that union because that's where we we started you know we we quote unquote built the middle class i think it's time for the uaw to rebuild the middle class and it's not going to happen if we're uh you know too worried about that 800 million dollar strike fund and and not actually dipping into it and using it what for what it was intended for and that's to hold power absolutely um eddie on that note do you have any questions um i don't know i just i think that's uh really good what you said because when when act 10 was happening in wisconsin and they were looking to take away teachers collective bargaining rights some of the the teachers went on strike which like we said doesn't have a huge effect but um but also some of the manufacturing unions and stuff in wisconsin went on strike in solidarity but like you said it just wasn't sustainable um because people had to get back to work to feed their families so they weren't able to get they weren't able to get anything honestly so that's probably the reason why they're so hesitant to continue giving the unemployment bonuses because they want people off the streets right now and they can't seem to do it by beating them so they're going to try starving them to death right absolutely as far as the actual physical workplace um what are some some changes in your sort of everyday uh routine um at work that you would like to to see and connected to that um how can the changes you think that the union itself should make help in acquiring those um those goals of changes within the actual workplace um well so that it's gonna be a little bit of a long answer so i don't want to necessarily throw john deere in particular under the bus so i'm just going to make a more broad statement on an industrial work in general so there's a lot of fossil fuels that get burnt in those buildings for example not every building has fork trucks that are electric a lot of them still run on natural gases so i mean there's just one simple thing right there that you have 1400 people inside of a building all day long with um a lot of fork trucks driving around doesn't just happen at john deere it happens that caterpillar or wherever else so not trying to throw john deere under the bus by any stretch the only way those things can change though is like if we make major reforms to uh how we look at bargaining and right now our bargaining power rests in wages and in healthcare and you know there was a time when working conditions were really at the forefront of of most negotiations you know you establish a wage across the industry and eventually then you're negotiating working conditions but that that hasn't happened for a long time there's a lot of buildings that i'm aware of across the country that are in need of massive overhauls to get up with the times again burning a lot of fossil fuels when alternative energy options are available um so i i think you know these things all kind of come hand in hand the union needs to do a better job of protecting workers in terms of where they're spending their dollars politically and they also need to protect them better in where they use their bargaining power with with the companies that they represent or however you want to look at it absolutely eddie do you have any questions on that um not really i think um uh the probably the last question that um we would ask just to not have it be too long um because we have to like make it into a transcript and stuff but um would be uh one that's that's more so the relationship of basically um us and yourself like what do you see the the relationship being or the the role that academia can play within within the struggles of of the working class one of the one of the things that um that is a focus of to me and eddie is how in other revolutionary movements one of the most common common things are that radical circles of academia and the intelligencia are working within working-class people and in latin america that's the case a lot of the marxist scholars from there that i follow they're militants and they're within working class circles but it seems to be that here and then in the u.s or more broadly in the west um radical academics are in one circle and then three miles away from them uh are are workers so it's it's it's kind of a yin and yang situation where each one has a void of the other and they both really i think they need to click in order for there to be some sort of uh revolutionary movement in the united states so what would you see the role of of academia and and the working class struggle as and how can that relationship in your opinion be mended where where radical academics and radical politics can can work with labor in the u.s ah well i mean so there there's a lot to pack there so i'll try to keep it as short as possible um i i organizing it i mean has to be the the answer there and i'm not really sure how you blend academics and traditional union organizers but i know a couple guys that do it fairly well and their their approach um seems to be based more in a reality of what goes on strictly in terms of working class issues and doesn't stray too far into you know talking about uh dialectics and things of that nature um so really just staying at home with hey your boss does a b c or d and it's related to capital in a simple easy to understand fashion and this is what you can do as a worker in a real simple without having to have read all eight volumes of capital or seven or however many there is just being able to relay it um but that's hard for any organizer to do you know even if you're talking to somebody about like medicare for all you will find yourself wanting to get into the walkiness of things and that's really the turn off to people because they they do have a genuine concern for these things but when they feel like you're approaching them like they don't know what's going on in their life uh that's that's a major turn off so i mean in terms of you know just making it real simple i think if if academics want to continue to to organize in these spaces they need to leave the books at home uh roll up their sleeves and really try to get a sense of like what it means to be out in the field picking strawberries for less than minimum wage and it's 100 degrees outside you know wrap their heads around that a little bit more and and worry a little bit less about being perfect in the nuances of the ideology that they are trying to adhere to to be what i mean i'm guilty of that myself and i'm in the in the working class you know so i have to remind myself when i'm speaking with my co-workers that they don't all fully understand capital and its relationship to what you know we do in our day-to-day lives they don't they don't always see the connection where to me it's glaringly obvious those contradictions sometimes don't land um as as bluntly on you know people because of american exceptionalism this idea that if you're in a factory and you're working 10 hours a day you're some sort of uh man or you know stronger individual so a lot of times there they got a large wall built up to some of this stuff so you just got to be able to find that way to get in there and really you know show that you are you know standing right next to them in solidarity absolutely and i think um to be completely just paradoxical and a conversation that we're talking about having to get away from the books i think hegel would provide provide a perfect example of this because the thing is that um traditionally we see like the material world that's what's concrete and the idea is as abstract and hegel's formula flips that and says that actually the idea is it's it's what's concrete and and what's material is really just an abstraction of the idea and it seems to be that academics um in being in this field of what is considered abstract are really doing the easiest stuff they're in the concrete and what they really have to do is flip it and verse it again negate it and and really be in the field in what's considered concrete but to like a hegelian would be the abstract which is the concrete reality really go to the fields and pick and understand what um what that lifestyle is like in order for them to maybe after be able to provide the work that's necessary to blend the the relationship between radical politics and academia and and the working class um well i mean you you can't uh just dismiss the resentment that's been built up over decades and decades and decades of you know class war in this country so when you're when you're coming from when they know that hey this person's a professor at a b c or d college and you know maybe maybe three or four people in their entire family is i ever graduated from college because of lacking the means for individuals to go to college because of cost of college in this country there's resentment built in there that's i mean that again comes to you we gotta like and myself i'm guilty of this too because i'm white male so i do have a certain amount of privilege that you know my brothers and sisters in the union might not come from so i have to remember that when having these conversations that maybe my level of education is different from theirs and i'm looking at them like hey idiot how come you don't understand this it's right in front of your face when i should be realizing that i'm coming from a place of privilege and that's why i have those thoughts so i think a lot of it is the same sort of things that we're dealing with you know just really recognizing uh that we do have uh uh we are an imperial nation uh coming to grips with that coming to grips with the the the costs of uh living the american dream all that plays into everything that we're talking about with unions uh corruption you know we got a large hurdle to overcome and a lot of it has to do with our history and that's where i really think academics can really play a huge role uh i'm just not sure exactly how that plays out in terms of organizing and you know making it real yeah i want to add i think um you talked about the division between you know people who haven't come for privilege and people who have but and i also think that's uh like the ruling collector like it's a ruling class strategy to sow that division and at least in my own experience growing up in in wisconsin my dad was a teacher so you know we were fairly middle class and then when they took that when walker was taking the teachers collective bargaining rights i saw these working class republican kids just kind of unknowingly backing walker and they were you know all these attacks about how the teachers were lazy and you know i've watched my dad work his butt off his whole life he has a second job at coca-cola to put me in my fam for me my brother my sister through college and then i'm hearing all these people calling lazy and i started to build up resentment against anyone who was working class you know i thought they were uneducated and i thought they were just pawns when when really when you allow yourself to um to build that contempt for working people you're being upon yourself you know that's that's exactly what they would like us to do you know to sew that rift in between um in between academics and the in the blue crawler working class there so yeah no i mean i definitely i agree with that because i've seen it from both sides you know i've held that resentment against those in academia and then when i was going to school i kind of seen myself kind of being like won't these people just go get an education so i mean it works both ways you know i've been on both sides of it and it is it is definitely a hurdle but i mean you guys have been doing a great job with the labor club a lot of the stuff that you guys have been doing you know you make a welcoming environment for folks to show up and be able to participate even if they have some different views so you guys been doing a real good job with it so there's definitely hope for old birds like me who are walking around uh an industrial uh uh warehouse full of guys wearing make america great again hats and stuff so thank you thanks for thanks for keeping it going fellas we appreciate that that's uh that means a lot to us that's i think uh i think that that was just totally the the point of the labor club because we were surrounded by a bunch of kids in a private institution who looked down upon people who work so um it was it was important to spread the ideas of socialism but also to to spread ideas that in work there's there's dignity it's um it's something that's dignified and that is it's the source of our economy and everything we do have um everything that we have we have to thank labor for so um yeah and i think a good point that you made like doing it is so important like i part of what helped break down the stereotypes for me was i went and i worked concrete for a summer and i was like these are the hardest working dudes in the world and their lives absolutely suck and their boss is so rich and he doesn't work at all and and they weren't dumb like i had thought they would be especially the ones who were illegal immigrants there because you know it was the only job they could get was this kind of crappy concrete place they were super intelligent and fun to talk to and like doing that work gives you the respect and there's no way to even understand how tough that lifestyle is until you've done it like i've wrestled my whole life and working concrete was harder than anything i've ever done by far the the last job i had at john deere before i got laid off was a pretty pretty laid-back job but the job won over for me was a pretty difficult job and the dude that did it ran around all day like it was nothing you know and i kept looking like man i couldn't even do that job this dude like runs through it well that dude ends up one day when i'm joking about like man you move fast or whatever he tapped his wrench on his leg and pulled his pants up dude had a titanium leg on one leg so here i am like man i don't even know if i could do that job and this dude was running circles around that job with one leg so i mean there's guys with you know missing fingers out there you know doing welding jobs and [ __ ] and you look at them like how does that guy even hold the thing like you know so people make a lot of sacrifices for you know just just to be able to send their kid to school and [ __ ] like that and it go it gets overlooked quite a bit in this in this country you know some something i feel like if we lived in a different country you know we would be having a little more a little bit more respect and maybe that's all that's missing in this country is like teaching people like the proper respect that's due to anybody that that puts their life on the line to make anything better definitely absolutely yeah i love how like celebrities uh um one fun quote from celebrities is treat the treat the janitor how you treat the ceo it's like you know you don't [ __ ] do that no you should should treat the janitor better than the ceo because ceo's fine he's fine he's fine absolutely um is are there any uh closing remarks that you would like to to say louie already um i mean i'll i'll say that um you know that there is a lot of doom and gloom right now with this the uh whole where we're becoming a fascist state and all this crap and you know a lot a lot of folks are are getting information from people that are making it seem like this just started happening three years ago and i think uh you know you guys and the work that you're doing uh should feel really proud that you're kind of shining a light on that this is isn't a problem that started three years ago uh started a lot longer than that and the only thing that's ever really beat it back has been labor uh whether it's you know the uaw participating in the civil rights movement you know being there in solidarity you know all the way through so you know labor is a big deal and i'm glad you guys are continuing to work on this because it is going to be the the biggest tool in the toolbox when it comes to beating back fascism and everything that we're faced with right now absolutely yeah thank you thank you for coming on the week we really appreciate it um and uh and yeah go labor and and uh oh yeah i'ma stop the recording now he could probably stay on and chat everyone
