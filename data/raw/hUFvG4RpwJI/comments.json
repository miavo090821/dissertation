You really didn't think it through did you? I'm kind of bullying you now but it is kind of true that you didn't think it all the way considering the examples you give.

I agree with you they shouldn't have a baby but I'm part of the faction that think for pure monetary reasons not because of anything genetic. Please don't into the argument that they are since what would be the point of eugenics if it culls a population that could provide someone genetically good if they get out of being addicted? Wouldn't that be just bias? I'm pretty sure you know it is, but since it's advantageous for you you're not going to question it won't you? Eugenics is going to have alot biases if given to people like you and people in general so we shouldn't promote it unless there's a neutral entity to regulate it but it's kind impossible.

I think I can confidently state that it will benefit future generations at least if done right. If you need to prop up birth rates just engage in some positive eugenics and provide incentives for the right people to have more children. That being said i'm not entirely sure our age demographics are as much of a problem as one would think. I suspect we are entering into an age of mass automation of labor anyway and may be better off with fewer mouths to feed should we run into a situation of mass unemployment. Of course the transition is going to tricky regardless but I certainly don't think re-population by whatever means necessary is wise especially when it results in ethno-demographic shifts from populations with a poor history of maintaining first world standards of society. \n\nDone right proper eugenics programs would certainly benefit me and in far more significant ways than petty pride. Honestly anyone who wants to make societally altering decisions just to stroke their own ego has to be a pretty fucked up and childish person. So your argument here is that should we dare go down this taboo line of thinking that it just might lead to genocide? Ok so what? If someone can make a compelling argument for why exterminating a group of people is necessary and morally justifiable then i'm all for it.

I don't think eugenics will ever work on a large scale due to clear human biases that's bound happen, and would also be a clear violation of human rights but you don't care about that anyways right? As long as it feeds into your own biases, and what you think will give better benefit to humanity even if it's coherently questionable. It's much better for us to watch the world stabilize the population than do anything to impede, and probably worsen the situation. A good notable example for population control would be China with their one-child-policy, and look how that turned out. Don't think it won't backfire and don't start dismissing China just because it's different, and it's a shithole or something.",

        "text": "+Automatan Potato\nIt seems to me that China's policies were just poorly thought out. They probably should have reacted more quickly to changes and adjusted policy over the years. Of course it still may end up being in their best interests in the long run. Given their rapid industrialization an explosion of births over the last few decades could have had them in a far worse spot than they are right now. I'm not really trying to convince you by the way. Just looking to pick your brain to see what counter arguments you have concerning the subject. Also I didn't say forced steralization was a \"natural risk with power\". I said that any power you give the state comes with the inherent risk that governments will abuse said power. If you are suggesting that I don't really care if certain minority populations are disproportionately effected by eugenics policies well yea I don't. Is there any reason I should give a shit about the population share of certain groups decreasing if they aren't a net benefit to society relative to other groups? I don't really consider diversity to be a virtue in itself.",

        "text": "@dbojangles1597 No, it actually wasn't poorly thought out, or at least in proportion to your own arguments. It seemed logical to do (like the way you think), and they did it since they didn't think of the possible consequences. Also, they're one party, and authoritarian so of course they could've reacted quicker but why do you think they didn't? You're only able to say \"*ThEy ShOulD'Ve ReActEd MorE qUiCkLy*\" now is because you already know about about the problems, and they didn't. They couldn't exactly grasp what was happening since they had no prior knowledge, and it took time for the data to come (it doesn't happen quickly, and they actually introduced a 1.5 child policy) but by that time it was already too late. They didn't exactly realize that there birth rates were going to go down in proportion to their industrialization anyways(considering other countries), and the one-child-policy created an unnecessary rift, and complications in the proportions of the males, and females. The government eventually acted to introduce a two child policy instead(there birth rate is 1. 54), and is now actively promoting marriage due to the disproportion. Due to the disproportion it's estimated at least 1/4 young males in China are unlikely going to get married, coupled with the fact there's still leftover women, tripled with a low birth rate, quadrupled with a extremely large aging population, and with that population making up almost 45% of their profits in the economy China isn't going to benefit from the one-child-policy anytime soon. I mean like how? If they didn't mess with their populations to begin with they weren't going to overpopulate to 2 billion anyways. They're not India, and India is also naturally stabilizing. China is in a much worse situation and thanks to it they might need to actually increase their population, and wait decades until those problems subside. Also, why are you using semantics to invalidate what I said? You know for a fact what I said isn't coherently wrong but you still called out for it. Why? Is it something you think is actually inaccurate or you just want something to latch on? I actually read what you said and I should've just quoted it properly but pretty sure you were going to latch on about it if I said it somewhat incorrectly. Maybe you did it on purpose? One last thing, there's a difference between not caring, and persecution (7th step to genocide). Eugenics is never going to work due to biases, and especially with your dehumanization of people. I mean actually tell me who you think are eligible to be part of the breeding program. It's been way too vague for long, and tell me who'd be culled without simply calling them \"degenerates\". We'll go in limbo forever if you don't tell me especially when you seem to decisive on implementing it. Wouldn't it be wierd if you were indecisive on who? Or are you going to tell me it's only necessary after you can implement it?",

First, the principles of Satanism, if we mean LaVayan satanism, which is what people generally mean when they say Satanism, is pretty darn anti-Marxist, as its really closer aligned to Ayn Rand's Objectivism in character, and isn't far from the ideas of the American Libertarian party. Which is pretty far from Marxist.\nOf course, you could believe in ancient 'Satanism' and if you do mean such, I recommend you look to any scholar of the subject. Or even go read King James' book, Demonologies. Both of which will tell you there is no such thing as \"Satanism\" before LaVay. (At least, King James will tell you there was none in the Elizabethan period of England--and abroad, and in the known past. And he is literally writing the book on hunting for witches, wizards, necromancers and 'agents of Satan' and even his book will tell you there were never 'satanists'.)",

Those are Nazi's, and they adopted the name to make themselves more agreeable to the German masses, since naturally the masses would not go for mass genocide. They are not \"socialist\" in any sense of the word. The National Socialist platform calls for conservative sensibilities. Its racist and xenophobic and highly right wing. National Socialism distrusts outsiders and those that are not racially pure. The way it handles corporations is also different from a Representative Democracy (US) or Communism (Soviet Union/China) major corporations and sectors of the economy maintain a level of autonomy but are still highly connected with the government. And example would be Nazi Germany and the Reich Aviation Ministry. As well as other sectors of the German war machine and we all know how that ended.\n\n\nBut national socialism is by no means actual socialism. An actual socialist government would truly care about the well being of its citizenry as a whole. Instead of dishing platitudes and gaslighting them while blaming outsiders who in the case of Nazi Germany were blaming Jews and Jewish Russian immigrants migrating into Germany many of whom were attempting to escape Soviet rule and persecution. Or current right-wing Americans who are blaming those rascally Mexicans for everything, even when they aren't to blame. find a problem? Blame the Mexicans and illegal immigrants. \n\n\nSounds like a socialist doesn't it? Enough of that.\n\n\nOf course, we all know what happens when Nazis rule at least what happened in Germany. 6 million Jews murdered in those camps. And those numbers were probably higher, those were just the Jews, doesn't account for the other non-Aryans the disabled and generally people that saw through the lies. Gassed or shot like dogs when they weren't slaving and working to death for the war machine.\n\n\nThe idea that the Nazi's were \"socialist\" is about as much of a weak lie when they came out with it as it is now.

Let’s hear from his own words:\n\n\nHitler on Marxism\n“National Socialism derives from each of the two camps the pure idea that characterizes it, national resolution from bourgeois tradition; vital, creative socialism from the teaching of Marxism.” – \n\nJanuary 27, 1934, interview with Hanns Johst in Frankforter Volksblatt\n\nHitler on Teaching Socialism\n“There is a difference between the theoretical knowledge of socialism and the practical life of socialism. People are not born socialists, but must first be taught how to become them.” – \n\nOctober 5, 1937, speech in Berlin\n\nHitler on Capitalism\n“In those countries, it is actually capital that rules; that is, nothing more than a clique of a few hundred men who possess untold wealth and, as a consequence of the peculiar structure of their national life, are more or less independent and free. They say: ‘Here we have liberty.’ By this they mean, above all, an uncontrolled economy, and by an uncontrolled economy, the freedom not only to acquire capital but to make absolutely free use of it. That means freedom from national control or control by the people both in the acquisition of capital and in its employment. This is really what they mean when they speak of liberty. These capitalists create their own press and then speak of the ‘freedom of the press.’ In reality, every one of the newspapers has a master, and in every case this master is the capitalist, the owner. This master, not the editor, is the one who directs the policy of the paper. If the editor tries to write other than what suits the master, he is ousted the next day. This press, which is the absolutely submissive and characterless slave of the owners, molds public opinion. Yes, certainly, we jeopardize the liberty to profiteer at the expense of the community, and, if necessary, we even abolish it.” – \n\nDecember 10, 1940, speech in Berlin\n\nHitler on Socialism\n“Socialism as the final concept of duty, the ethical duty of work, not just for oneself but also for one’s fellow man’s sake, and above all the principle: Common good before own good, a struggle against all parasitism and especially against easy and unearned income.

        "text": "@keyan1219 Plenty of it. Just read mein kampf. How many times does Hitler mention socializing the people? There are many passages showing he was anti-capitalist and saw a different type of socialism from communism. The SPD did as well. You have him remarking how his socialism is different from fascism and communism. I would refer you to the youtuber TiK history. He spends three hours pulling the quotations and making the case. Guess what self identified national socialists agree it was socialism. The video we are responding does make a point there isn't one type of socialism or even one idea of capitalism. Hitler being socialist doesn't mean Stalin or even Bernie Sanders are Nazis. It simply means that National Socialism was a split off branch from earlier socialist movements. I am pretty Libertarian but capitalism is only a necessary condition not sufficient for freedom. i don't support Pinochet because he was capitalist. I am not saying someone who supports \"socialism\" is a Nazi. I am saying 99% of those saying they support socialism don't have a clue as to what it means or what they are talking about same goes for 99% who are against socialism. \nThe danger is unlike me realizing without proper protections for individuals in constitutions that capitalistism won't be enough, socialist seem to think all you need is socialism. It misses Solcnitzen's point that it was the all powerful government of the transitory state that corrupted people. The idea of a powerful government to coerce people into socializing to look out for the common good fails for that reason. When the government is that powerful it seeks its own ends not some utopian idea of the individual working for the good of society in some Picard non-sense that some transitory government will bust heads until human nature is changed. Orwell knew this too well. In road to Wigan Pier he notes that the socialist don't like the poor but hold them in contempt, they had the rich. It is an act of selfish for their own good that they support socialism not some lofty ideal of the betterment of mankind. It is just take what someone else has and give it to me screw the poor.",

You probably look at in the vernacular as purely economic and not a social philosophy based on changing human nature through busting heads until as Engles put they no longer have to be coerced but rather apply the socialist principles on their own without coercion. The parts you site are attacks on the KPD and SPD it isn't a repudiation of socialism. They didn't put socialism in the name just because it sounded cool. They believed fully human nature had to be changed to be socialized. National Socialism took the class conflict theory and changed to a tribal conflict theory. We call it race today but Volk was not race as we use it today. It was much more of a tribal notion of blood and soil than a racial idea as we would see it today. Again for the millionth time the fact that Hitler didn't like other forms of socialism doesn't mean he wasn't socialist to him they were the real socialists and all others were misguided. Socialism today and then is more like a religion speaking of true prophets while denying other sects than it is a pure intellectual way to structure economic transactions. This is in stark contrast to the Friedman style Libertarians who see classical liberalism as the way forward with individual liberty paramount and capitalism as a way to organize economic activity in a way that preserves freedom. The difference is while capitalism is part of the philosophy of public life, we know the limits and where it has gone wrong in places like Chile when the government was authoritarian. Socialist call on the high preist to say that wasn't socialism and we just need the right people in charge. Hayek was dead as was Solzhenitsyn that when you give governments too much power it will work for its own ends with the worst seeking the power you give them, it won't lead to socialist utopia where the government withers away and some Picard like federation exists. It will lead to some of the worst tyrannies man has ever known. It was the socialist idea of socializing the people to change their nature that led to all of this. It gave raison d'etre for the authoritarian state and made people believe they can eliminate the rich or those of another \"volk\" for the betterment of humanity. This simple idea that conflict is only one thing and if we take away class or make it all one people it will be utopia is the danger socialist don't want to recognize in their rhetoric of equal outcomes and people possessing one thought ideas. As far as TIK being discredited I have seen the response it is a lot of that isn't real socialism we are the real socialists. I still laugh at an undergraduate presentation some idiot in a red beret telling a Russian that he was the real socialist and the USSR wasn't socialist. State capitalism doesn't exist. It is people like Wolff obfuscating the fact no society is 100% capitalist, socialist, command, or market and cherry picking small packets of agriculture to ignore the massive state ownership and command economy of the USSR to say they weren't socialist we are. It is just I know you are but what am I.",

It is a philosophy of intergroup conflict and a need for a strong state to remove those groups to get to some Moore like utopia to put it shortly. It isn't health care for all or economic equality. It is the idea man is too flawed and has to be whipped into shape to do the best for the public so the all powerful state will somehow be benevolent and just wither away when it isn't needed instead of flawed people not being willing to misuse or eventually give up the ultimate power you have given them. Marx was dead wrong human nature would transformed by a strong state and go away. The more Friedmanite Libertarian philosophy is the opposite and more correct when you give a group of people too much power they will not only misuse it but cling to the power you gave them. People working in self interest gives them incentive to provide for others and to block others from violating rights. This idea we can have a benevolent state that whips everyone into shape and then go away is a pipe dream Hitler and National Socialism spouted with no intention of ever withering away just as Lenin and Stalin had no intention of the state going away.",

Again the rich and powerful who could afford to be absent for a few months at a time, unlike the craftsmen or small farmers, a situation that was even worse in the less developed south that on average would be the farthest from D.C. amongst the states until they at least crossed the Mississippi 45ish years after the declaration of independence and about 30ish years after the constitution was passed in the continental congress.).",

Depite the hypocrisy, it still gave (and still gives) a vital launch pad for the people to make the government's actions (and \"We The People's\" day-to-day cultural values) match that noble ideal.  Maybe all great improvements in human treatment have to come from hypocrites (still partially trapped in their past cultural values).

Maybe I have a right to it, but the pen has no rights. So, this is just a code phrase for the rights of people with property. The constitutional system was founded on the principle that the rights of people with property have to be privileged; they have rights because they're people, but they also have especial rights because they have property. As Madison put it in the constitutional debates, the goal of government must be \"to protect the minority of the opulent against the majority\". That's the way the system was set up.\" - Noam Chomsky",

        "text": "This is for all you Socialist/ Marxist Sycophants on this thread , Hitler Was a Socialist Who Learned from Karl Marx. Let’s hear from his own words:\n\n\nHitler on Marxism\n“National Socialism derives from each of the two camps the pure idea that characterizes it, national resolution from bourgeois tradition; vital, creative socialism from the teaching of Marxism.” – \n\nJanuary 27, 1934, interview with Hanns Johst in Frankforter Volksblatt\n\nHitler on Teaching Socialism\n“There is a difference between the theoretical knowledge of socialism and the practical life of socialism. People are not born socialists, but must first be taught how to become them.” – \n\nOctober 5, 1937, speech in Berlin\n\nHitler on Capitalism\n“In those countries, it is actually capital that rules; that is, nothing more than a clique of a few hundred men who possess untold wealth and, as a consequence of the peculiar structure of their national life, are more or less independent and free. They say: ‘Here we have liberty.’ By this they mean, above all, an uncontrolled economy, and by an uncontrolled economy, the freedom not only to acquire capital but to make absolutely free use of it. That means freedom from national control or control by the people both in the acquisition of capital and in its employment. This is really what they mean when they speak of liberty. These capitalists create their own press and then speak of the ‘freedom of the press.’ In reality, every one of the newspapers has a master, and in every case this master is the capitalist, the owner. This master, not the editor, is the one who directs the policy of the paper. If the editor tries to write other than what suits the master, he is ousted the next day. This press, which is the absolutely submissive and characterless slave of the owners, molds public opinion. Yes, certainly, we jeopardize the liberty to profiteer at the expense of the community, and, if necessary, we even abolish it.” – \n\nDecember 10, 1940, speech in Berlin\n\nHitler on Socialism\n“Socialism as the final concept of duty, the ethical duty of work, not just for oneself but also for one’s fellow man’s sake, and above all the principle: Common good before own good, a struggle against all parasitism and especially against easy and unearned income. And we were aware that in this fight we can rely on no one but our own people.

The whole of National Socialism is based on it.’Why’, I asked Hitler, ‘do you call yourself a National Socialist, since your party program is the very anthesis of that commonly accredited to Socialism?’\n\n‘Socialism’, he retorted, putting down his cup of tea, ‘is the science of dealing with the common weal [health or well-being]. Communism is not Socialism. Marxism is not Socialism. The Marxians have stolen the term and confused its meaning. I shall take Socialism away from the Socialists.\n\n‘Socialism is an ancient Aryan, Germanic institution. Our German ancestors held certain lands in common. They cultivated the idea of the common weal. Marxism has no right to disguise itself as socialism. Socialism, unlike Marxism, does not repudiate private property. Unlike Marxism, it involves no negation of personality and, unlike Marxism, it is patriotic.\n\n‘We might have called ourselves the Liberal Party. We chose to call ourselves the National Socialists.

Won't anyone think of the poor protestants?! One of them went on tv and claimed that it was a threat to Northern Irish democracy and Protestant rights. That the only realistic thing to do, that obviously everyone agrees as totally reasonable and democratic, is for Sinn Féin to be moral and give them some of their newly elected constituencies so that the balance for Protestants was fair. They continued indefinitely to refuse going to their publicly paid job where they had been elected to actually walk into the building. \n\nUs Northern Irish don't have the best history of naming things contrary to implied meaning.

Like whites waited for natives to turn away and stole the soil bit by bit. Fuckin stupid. Its called conquered territory. Anyway, rant over, props for not \n\nAs for mass killing, cuddles with struggles, kidnappings and pillaging, etc.\n\nYeah, every conquering people have done just the same, i wish it wouldn't be a part of humanity but it is as it is. Communist countries have done it, socialists, capitalist and fuck just tribes fighting other tribes do it\n\nIts a sad truth. One that children do not need to learn, children should focus on being children, enjoying the time in their lives when their parents take care of them, forming friendships and developing their character. Not learning about the horrors of war, that can come after the magic of their formative years have dissipated.",

And we were aware that in this fight we can rely on no one but our own people. We are convinced that socialism in the right sense will only be possible in nations and races that are Aryan, and there in the first place we hope for our own people and are convinced that socialism is inseparable from nationalism.” \n\n– A. Hitler , August 15, 1920, speech in Munich at the Hofbräuhaus.\n\n“Germany’s economic policy is conducted exclusively in accordance with the interests of the German people. In this respect I am a fanatical socialist, one who has ever in mind the interests of all his people.” \n\n– A. Hitler , February 24, 1941, speech on the 21st anniversary of the Nazi Party\n\n“All the more so after the war, the German National Socialist state, which pursued this goal from the beginning, will tirelessly work for the realization of a program that will ultimately lead to a complete elimination of class differences and to the creation of a true socialist community.” \n\n– A.

At least Native American slavery was talked about. I never heard that Natives were slave owners and that Europeans were enslaved until I looked it up on my own. Europeans had centuries of being enslaved too, you think that would be talked about more. European countries were also conquered 100s of times like the Moors that conquered Spain and enslaved like 1.2 million for 3 centuries. Also what about the Mongols, Persians, other African and Arab tribes, etc. It’s happened 100s of times. \n\n\nBeing educated doesn’t mean you are left, it’s just that the left is more in control of methods of influence and are more smart promoting certain stories instead of all sides of a conflict/story to have an open discussion/discourse where everything is discussed.",

And we were aware that in this fight we can rely on no one but our own people. We are convinced that socialism in the right sense will only be possible in nations and races that are Aryan, and there in the first place we hope for our own people and are convinced that socialism is inseparable from nationalism.” \n\n– A. Hitler , August 15, 1920, speech in Munich at the Hofbräuhaus.\n\n“Germany’s economic policy is conducted exclusively in accordance with the interests of the German people. In this respect I am a fanatical socialist, one who has ever in mind the interests of all his people.” \n\n– A. Hitler , February 24, 1941, speech on the 21st anniversary of the Nazi Party\n\n“All the more so after the war, the German National Socialist state, which pursued this goal from the beginning, will tirelessly work for the realization of a program that will ultimately lead to a complete elimination of class differences and to the creation of a true socialist community.” \n\n– A. Hitler, March 21, 1943, speech for Heroes’ Memorial Day",

It's when the state owns the means of productions. \n\nYou're wrong when you say that what Hitler did was Socialism of the right. There is no such thing. Right ideologies need to have some kind of a market economy, the more left leaning it is, the more collective control is over the means of production. So when it comes down to the market, if a private can not decide what's best for his own business, then it can't be a right ideology.\n\nThe state did control the means of production. By \"gleichschaltung\" of the economy. The individual can not act upon the interest of his own and has to operate for the state, as an organ of the state.\n\nI think its stupid to associate certain ideologies with left or right. The whole idea of left and right is wrong and an unproductive way of telling what an ideology is.\n\nA better way is by sorting it by how the  state controls the economy and simultaneously look in what kind of system of power the country runs. From democracy to Republic, then monarchy and lastly totalitarianism. \n\nThe conclusion is, there is nothing \"right wing\" about Hitler. As the nazi regime was totalitarianism, which simply can not exist under a \"right wing\" ideology.",

It is wrong, and many woman live with it their whole lives because they know it is wrong. \n   \n   I do not want to make it easier on them at all... IF a woman does murder her unborn child then she should suffer the choice for the rest of her days. As a murderer. \n\n   What about the rights of the father... what about social contracts and rule of law. Why does the act matter as to whom is making the choice... \n   In my country, America, I can not even kill myself, as suicide is still a form of murder. \n\n   HOW DOES THAT MAKE ANY SENSE. It is my life, and my choice by your standards and yet it is murder here in the states, any way you shake it. Yet woman can still decide the fate of another life, and with or without the fathers consent can end said life.....\n\n I do not know of any state law that does not include an unborn child under the rotection of the law in murder cases.\n\n   If a womans survival hinged on killing the child, then there may be grounds for excetion. Also there is a biiiiiiig difference between cows and babies.\n\n   Abortion is wrong. Killing sentient life is wrong. Aborting sentient life is wrong.",

Eugenics is literally an ideology that proposes restricted breeding to CONTROL THE PURITY OF THE GENE POOL and harvest resources for the strongest most intelligent people. This was supported by people such as Roosevelt, Churchill, HG Wells, even Helen Keller who was herself blind. \nFrom the late 1800's to the current day Eugenics is still alive and well. In the US for example forced sterilisation was continued until at least 1963 in California for those deemed \"unfit\" to give birth.  Eugenics became a dirty word after Hitlers programs came to light. The whole ideology was repackaged and became \"planned parenthood\" \nThe legalisation of abortion was nothing to do with feminist ranting, in fact abortion was legal in many places before feminism was even a buzzword. Abortion was a required outcome for  \"purity of genes. The belief behind this was that only poor people, the unintelligent and the sexually promiscuous would use such services. This I would suggest has been well and truly born out. It's not wealthy educated people who use abortion clinics. If I'm correct, as I don't have the figures to hand, abortion is predominantly used by, in the US at least, primarily black, poor, and uneducated people.  This was the demographic abortion was aimed at.\nTo suggest abortion is primarily used to abort a foetus with Downs Syndrome is pretty weird, the physical or mental capacities of most aborted foetuses is not even known. It requires specific tests to check for Downs Syndrome in unborn babies, most of which are unaffordable for those getting abortions and given anyway only in specific cases where there is a genuine risk. I.e age, previous children, family history etc.\nI suggest you do some reading on the ideology of Eugenics, the aims of Eugenics and how Eugenics has evolved to ease pressure on the welfare state and other resources. \nNYC latest ruling on late term abortions is not merely a pandering to \"female empowerment\" it's the final chance to choose whether a baby will be a burden or a value to society, especially for those pregnant mothers who did not have pre birth scans or tests for possible disabilities.",

It does not make it a valid point to critisize me for it (or more commonly make fun of me) . b) That is an opinion. Knowing something is not as simple as it may appear as it relates to emotional responses because biological responses, social norms, stereotypes and traditions ARE A THING. Depression IS A THING. It's not divine intervention but a real, physical reaction. See 2a.\r\n3) a) This is not your diary. This should not be your choice. You don't go through it so the term 'easy' is something that is not applicable to any biological functions you will go through. b) Just because you want retribution for something you perceive as a crime does not make your claim to an emotional response any more justifiable than someone saying: A) I feel cat owners should die because im allergic to cats, or B) I feel that diabetics should be locked up for life. See 1\r\n4) a) The father will not be forced by any tangible biological response to care for the kid for the next (on average) 50 years nor will he be burdened by it for 9-24 months (leaving the kid at your local church is always an option after all) so yeah, forgive me when i say that a father's choice on the matter is not as significant as the mother's. b) Social constructs and the rule of law is something that changes. If you feel that it shouldn't you're probably thinking of social norms and structures through a very rigid point of view passed on through your beliefs (yes i was thinking religious and i don't have any evidence for this but i think it's true). c) Because one has to live with the decision (abortion or no) and one does not/potentialy does not have to (literally, you can't get an abortion. You might be thinking of the movie Junior but that's just a movie). d) If in my country we had a law that would give me jail time if I commited suicide I would not do it. See: Sarcasm.\r\n5) a) It does make sense. I'm trying to convey to you exactly that. b) Again, it is murder based on YOUR opinion ( see: 1, 3b and 4b).\r\n6) I am sorry if this sounds passive aggresive or hostile, but you don't sound like a legal scholar or practisioner ( see: 1 ).

        "text": "Three Arrows is an idiot im seeying the video. 1º the guy says \"who thinks hitler was a socialist is a demagogue\". So not very intelectual from him shows how a partizan hack he is. But continuing \"you dont know how i dislike having this conversations\" Yeah because youre a left wing fascist, fascists never like to argue. To your point i think Crowder is economically extreme right, he says things like \"taxation is theft\" which it is not always it is sometimes. He is not the smartest guy around so he is kind of confusing in some of what he says. Crowder was right in one point, germans accepted the socialist view that the top 1%, the jews, were stealing from them namely throw the international banking system. Thats the same rethoric as Bernie Sanders, going after the top 1% so yes, in the backbone its the same socialist ideology of the opressor (the top 1%) opressing the 99%. Your guy argues that the Nazis were on the right on the parlement. Ok in my country, the party at the right of my parlement is just a centrist party which talks trash about Trump, Bolsonaro and Orban. Ive got no right on my country and there was no right in Germany. Than your guy says those words of Hitler calling himself a socialist are fake. But i showed you a video of Hitler in 1940 saying he was an anti free capitalism guy !!! What is the name of someone who is anti free capitalism? A left winger!! Than he cites a nazi leader as calling everyone inequal. Thats not a right wing of left wing ideology saying there are people with more rights than others thought i could argue its a left wing ideology as in the USA the left argues whites should have less previleges like for example black guys need a lower score to enter in the university than white guys and that was a left wing policy to threat people inequality based in the color of their skin. 11mns \"Hitlers priority was jobs throw inftrastructure constrction\" meaning jobs throw the state a keyzian left wing policy. Thanks for confirming what i said. Than he says \"Hitler did not allow wages to rise with prices\" Thanks again for confirming what i already had told you, it was the Nazis the state who decided the wages. You didnt want to believe, there it is. State planned economy. Than he argues the autobahn did not have the promissed public workers.Ok so? Germany got to full employment levels, the State hired for gun production, still goes to the point of a state controlled economy. Ok so Hitler was not found of communism. And? Communism was a threat for his power, he went after everyone who was a threat to his power even nazi colleges. Than your guy says \"there were price restrictions\", again in Venezuela also. Thats an anti free capitalism state planned economy policy Hitler printed money not fiscaly conservative. Another left wing policy. Oh the means of production remained in private hands, and so nazism could not have been in the left. DEBUNKED unless you think everything that is not communism is right wing. Private companies were to fullfil the wishes of the Nazis. Another thing i said and you didnt want to believe. That is the base of the national socialist fascist economy, companies can be private as long as they do the bidding of the state.Than he argues \"oh but the nazis were planing an economy for war so we cant compare to todays capitalism societys\" ok and what is the USA society, isnt it capitalistic and yet the strongest military force with 16% of GDP going to the military complex? Again, debunked. Than he says nazis were not against the productive capitalism they were against the finantial capitalism. True. They were against what was the top 1% the jews!. And than he says it didnt take long to that to tangle itself to the antisemetic rethoric. Completely true that is what i already told you. Than he says that was \"paranoia\", not it was not paranoia, its the same ideology behind Bernie Sanders. Envy of the rich, calling them opressors. Than he argues the nazis privatized some companies like from owning 52% going to 25% ownership thus not having any power anymore. Thats wrong. Search for the ore mining companies where Hitler gave the order to them to mine the german ore dispite being private. Than your guy says nazism doesnt resemble free capitalism. Ok but a total free capitalist economy is the most far right ideology, so i can the guy argue it is not? Nazis nationalized healthcare. ok. He says Crowder is not being correct on the nazis promoting abortion but abortion of races they deemed inferior. I can give that to him, as i know it was the nazi policy to increase the german population, Crowder may be wrong there. He asks if is there anyone pushing for penalizing who does not believe in climate change? Give it enough time. We already are seeying in Canada laws to lock up people who \"misspronunce\" someone. Give anough time and power to the left the democratic party already tried to push \"hate speech\" laws. Than he claims the nazis killed a lot of lgbt people. False. At least lesbians i know werent persecuted, let alone killed. Completely false argument. Crowder says Hitler was a soclalist liberal, because he wanted big government. Your guy says \"its embaracing to him\" Why??? ok so Hitler was against Marx ideas, so your guy claims that means he wasnt on the left. Wtf? What kind of logic is that? Anything that is not communism is on the right is that it? And accuses him, Crowder of being a demagogue. Than he claims the nazis pushed for conservative values. Ok what conservative values? Nothing said. Than he says for Hitler economics was of secondary importance subordinated to politics. Thank you. Thats national socialism, allowing private ownership as long they do the biding of the State. Free economic capitalist replaced for State interest. Yes! Right wing ideology replaced by a Left wing ideology. Than its presented the Nazi program which Dinesh says its on the left, your guy says \"oh but nazis were on the right because: \"They were nationalistic\" FALSE. Gandhi and Mandela were left extremists and nationalistic. \"because Hitler was anti Marx\" FALSE. Being on the left is believing in the powerful state, the fact Hitler did not believe in the revolution of the masses of equality of all people, does not mean he didnt believe in the core belief of the Left a powerful State. \"Nazis were anti-semitic\" Ok that makes nazis in the right why?? Demagogue \"Nazis were expantionistic\" Thats on the right why??? Being pro-war is not a thing of the left or the right per se.",

Real Marxist idea would simply mean worker ownership of the means of production and a free association of these producers.\n\nThis idea is more acheivable in the USA or Germany than it is in developing nation if a working class was more conscious of the paradigm.\n\nSocial Democracy was designed by Bismarck as a response to thwart the development of socialism. It does so by making the urgency a mute point, meaning if the state is supplying the needs that workers want they are less likely to try to find ways in which they could collectively own the means of production.\n\nI also was trying to illustrate what Marx meant by class consciousness. Contrary to popular belief it was not merely “oppressor oppressed” paradigm. It was developing enough consciousness so the absurdity of the paradigm is abandoned altogether.\n\nIn other words it is a Hegelian synthesis of worker and bourgeoisie/capitalist/employer specifically because the workers are employing themselves.\n\nIt is much more realistic for educated workers of the USA or Germany to have access to capital, knowledge and resources to implement a cooperative solution than it would be for workers in a third world country.\n\nThe problem I see in the USA especially is clear, the working class is perpetually mystified watching things like FOX news.\n\nIn fact I watched FOX today and they multiple times conflated the majority of Democrats who are neoliberal with “radical socialism”. This is effective propaganda rendering any rational discussion nearly impossible. Because the conflate neoliberalism with social democracy with socialism and communism.\n\nThe failure of the left in the USA is specifically because the left is not informed by Marxism, and does not offer simple pragmatic Marxist solutions.\n\nA pragmatic Marxist solution would be to unite and prepare workers to take over the means of production. Have you seen many pragmatic proposals of this sort?\n\nThis could happen in many sectors of the economy. In Germany for example bank depositors are earning nearly Zero interest. So why not create cooperative banks? There is a health insurance problem in the USA why not create cooperative insurance. There is an education affordability problem why not create a cooperative education system. There is a low wage problem in things like food service why not create more cooperative franchises and grocery stores.",

Let’s hear from his own words:\n\n\nHitler on Marxism\n“National Socialism derives from each of the two camps the pure idea that characterizes it, national resolution from bourgeois tradition; vital, creative socialism from the teaching of Marxism.” – \n\nJanuary 27, 1934, interview with Hanns Johst in Frankforter Volksblatt\n\nHitler on Teaching Socialism\n“There is a difference between the theoretical knowledge of socialism and the practical life of socialism. People are not born socialists, but must first be taught how to become them.” – \n\nOctober 5, 1937, speech in Berlin\n\nHitler on Capitalism\n“In those countries, it is actually capital that rules; that is, nothing more than a clique of a few hundred men who possess untold wealth and, as a consequence of the peculiar structure of their national life, are more or less independent and free. They say: ‘Here we have liberty.’ By this they mean, above all, an uncontrolled economy, and by an uncontrolled economy, the freedom not only to acquire capital but to make absolutely free use of it. That means freedom from national control or control by the people both in the acquisition of capital and in its employment. This is really what they mean when they speak of liberty. These capitalists create their own press and then speak of the ‘freedom of the press.’ In reality, every one of the newspapers has a master, and in every case this master is the capitalist, the owner. This master, not the editor, is the one who directs the policy of the paper. If the editor tries to write other than what suits the master, he is ousted the next day. This press, which is the absolutely submissive and characterless slave of the owners, molds public opinion. Yes, certainly, we jeopardize the liberty to profiteer at the expense of the community, and, if necessary, we even abolish it.” – \n\nDecember 10, 1940, speech in Berlin\n\nHitler on Socialism\n“Socialism as the final concept of duty, the ethical duty of work, not just for oneself but also for one’s fellow man’s sake, and above all the principle: Common good before own good, a struggle against all parasitism and especially against easy and unearned income.

        "text": "@kruczyzmora2885 \nThank you for being open minded about this.\n\nNow, authoritarian governments are not an inherently socialist thing, despite what many americans believe. Socialism just requires collective ownership of industry, meaning everybody in a workplace is considered an owner of that workplace, unlike in capitalism where workplaces are owned and controlled by only a few bosses or shareholders. This doesn't require a strong state necessarily. There are in fact many socialists that identify as libertarians or anarchists, or who want a free market to distribute goods instead of a central govt body.\nSome famous anti-authoritarian socialists include Noam Chomsky, Peter Kroptkin, Rosa Luxembourg and Nestor Makhno.\n\nI wanted to clear this up. Being pro-authority doesn't mean you're pro-socialism, and vice versa.\n\nIf that were the case, chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet would be a socialist, and he was an outspoken anti-communist who shaped his countries after neoliberal super-capitalist principles.\n\nHitler also had a lot of negative things to say about the economics of the left in his book \"Mein Kampf\". Chapter 2 was literally about how marxism, the economic framework that birthed socialism, is a jewish plot to destroy the world and ignores fundamental parts of humanity.\nIn the same chapter he talked about how social democrats are manipulative crooks with an ideology not grounded in reality.\n\nAnd as this video explained, the nazis did have a bunch of socialists in their party before they came to power, but they were purged in the \"night of the long knifes\".\n\nThe nazis were opposed to socialism AND the free market, since they thought both were a threat to their nationalist culture, so what they settled on was an authoritarian state capitalist/corporatist economy.\n\nThe other vids by this youtuber explained that a bit further.\n\nThe nazis were not socialist just because they were authoritarians, or because they had \"socialist\" in their name. That was merely a misnomer.\nI think it's very good people like you are willing to learn. \n\nThank you for listening. 👍🏼",

And neither are the people that are arguing for a socialist revolution today.\n\nAnd libertarian socialism is not an oxymoron. If anything, libertarian capitalism is. Anarcho-Capitalists literally believe people have a right to buy slaves, as long as its \"voluntary\". They are fine with abolishing democracy and the total subjugation of the individual to an unquestioned authority, as long as that authority calls itself a CEO or a shareholder instead of a politician.\n\nEven Murray Rothbard admitted the word \"libertarian\" initially described left wing ideologies.\n\nReal and consistent libertarianism can only exist where the economy is ruled by all, not by a wealthy elite or a dictatorial state.\n\nSocialism aims to achieve real economic freedom for as many people as possible.

However there was a socialist party, social democrat, liberal and conservative. The Nazis were not placing the means of production in the hands of the worker. Which is THE definition of socialism. Hitler was a fascist through and through. You just don't know what socialism is. It is an organization of the economy. Creating a jobs program for Germans is not socialist. Also \"to each according to his ability and to each according to his need\" just because he was pro abortion(for low IQ people) doesn't mean he is a liberal. Many conservative Muslim countries allow abortion. They were incredibly capitalist. They used pro-worker language to pull in uneducated fed up workers(kind of like the American GOP does) and gives a scapegoat for all your problems. You are a bot. An NPC. Smooth brained.

(or by studying alot, whatever term you wanna use for the activites concerning those considerd educated) \n\nsocialist to set up a system? every political ideologi is the idea of setting up a system of the distribution of power.  even if education was so anarchistic to say \"read whatever\" that in its self is a system of education. you even use \"mentorship system\" a SYSTEM. also, alexander the great? taught under aristoteles, who himself was taught under platos school, or \"academy\" and aristoteles open a school himself beacuse of the recommendation of alexander. so your great general also liked systems, his mentor taught under a system. \n\nsystem isnt bad or political, it is just a descriptive word, not a euphemism for socialist or do you say you think alexander the great was a socialist? \n\nand before you say \"i said systemic instruction not systems\" setting up a system is instructing on how something should work so \"systemic instruction\" is just redundant use of words or in this case framing it as pedantic, \"too controling\", as \"socialism\" \n\nsince you are suggesting i am reasoning here why that suggestion does not work. or why considering \"systems\" belongs to a specific party shows more personal opinion of said word rather than it being politcal partisan. althought systems can be biased but that is then the construction of said system to be so rather than the existance of a system. so what you should argue is that the educational system of whatever country you are using as template is socialistic, not that a system exist therefore it is socialistic.\n\nedit: if you mean system in its more socialily used meaning rarther than the definitial use of the word, remember internet around the globe. the social use of a word is more situational and therefore easily to misinteprate. especially where there isnt a defined group. specify it if so.",

Let’s hear from his own words:\n\n\nHitler on Marxism\n“National Socialism derives from each of the two camps the pure idea that characterizes it, national resolution from bourgeois tradition; vital, creative socialism from the teaching of Marxism.” – \n\nJanuary 27, 1934, interview with Hanns Johst in Frankforter Volksblatt\n\nHitler on Teaching Socialism\n“There is a difference between the theoretical knowledge of socialism and the practical life of socialism. People are not born socialists, but must first be taught how to become them.” – \n\nOctober 5, 1937, speech in Berlin\n\nHitler on Capitalism\n“In those countries, it is actually capital that rules; that is, nothing more than a clique of a few hundred men who possess untold wealth and, as a consequence of the peculiar structure of their national life, are more or less independent and free. They say: ‘Here we have liberty.’ By this they mean, above all, an uncontrolled economy, and by an uncontrolled economy, the freedom not only to acquire capital but to make absolutely free use of it. That means freedom from national control or control by the people both in the acquisition of capital and in its employment. This is really what they mean when they speak of liberty. These capitalists create their own press and then speak of the ‘freedom of the press.’ In reality, every one of the newspapers has a master, and in every case this master is the capitalist, the owner. This master, not the editor, is the one who directs the policy of the paper. If the editor tries to write other than what suits the master, he is ousted the next day. This press, which is the absolutely submissive and characterless slave of the owners, molds public opinion. Yes, certainly, we jeopardize the liberty to profiteer at the expense of the community, and, if necessary, we even abolish it.” – \n\nDecember 10, 1940, speech in Berlin\n\nHitler on Socialism\n“Socialism as the final concept of duty, the ethical duty of work, not just for oneself but also for one’s fellow man’s sake, and above all the principle: Common good before own good, a struggle against all parasitism and especially against easy and unearned income. And we were aware that in this fight we can rely on no one but our own people. We are convinced that socialism in the right sense will only be possible in nations and races that are Aryan, and there in the first place we hope for our own people and are convinced that socialism is inseparable from nationalism.” – \n\nAugust 15, 1920, speech in Munich at the Hofbräuhaus.",

Not everyone who disagrees with the \"Nazis are actually socialists\" line are left wing or Marxist. \n\n2) \"Hitler Was a Socialist Who Learned from Karl Marx.\"-\n\n“The Jewish doctrine of Marxism denies the noble goal of Nature and sets mass and dead weight of numbers in place of the eternal privilege of strength and power. It denies the value of personality in man, disputes the significance of nation and race, and deprives mankind of the essentials of its survival and civilization. As a foundation of the universe, Marxism would be the end of any order conceivable to man. The result of applying such a law could only be chaos. Destruction would be the only result for the inhabitants of this planet. If, through his Marxist faith, the Jew conquers the peoples of this world, his crown will be the death and destruction of all mankind. Earth would again move uninhabited through space as it did millions of years ago. Eternal Nature takes revenge for violation of her commandments.”- Adolf Hitler, Mein Kampf\n\nHitlers own words are not to be trusted, as he would say anything to appeal to the masses; he was masterful at inciting emotional responses from his audiences.

Also white nationalists vote republican because some republicans want to build a southern wall,  send home illegals, vet legal migrants, and end the visa lottery system which are all great ideas and are not bad just because ethnonationalists vote for them. Seems part of what you're saying is because racist people vote for your party your party is now racist (even though your party ended slavery and jim crow) which is dumb reasoning. Step your game up. What was the name of the holocaust denying republican candidate's name with the racist billboard and what was he or she a candidate for?",

        "text": "In the months after Hitler took power, SA and *Gestapo agents went from door to door looking for Hitler’s enemies. They arrested Socialists, Communists, trade union leaders, and others who had spoken out against the Nazi party* some were murdered. By the summer of 1933, the Nazi party was the only legal political party in Germany. Nearly all organized opposition to the regime had been eliminated. Democracy was dead in Germany.\n*However, the assumption that because the word “socialist” appeared in the party’s name and socialist words and ideas popped up in the writings and speeches of top Nazis then the Nazis must have been actual socialists is naive and ahistorical. What the evidence shows, on the contrary, is that Nazi Party leaders paid mere lip service to socialist ideals on the way to achieving their one true goal: raw, right-wing totalitarian power*\n\nYes, the Nazis were indisputably Right-Wing\n\nSometimes the claim is bandied about that the Nazis were a left-wing party on economic questions, perhaps because the Nazis were called “National socialists”. This is flatly and completely wrong and a form of pseudo-historiography. Here’s why:\n\nThe Nazi party was built on right-wing voters and a right-wing support base:\n\nThere are many disputes about the nature of Hitler’s voting base. What isn’t under dispute though is that prior to voting Nazi, Nazi voters voted for centre-right and far-right parties, or didn’t vote at all. Support for the Nazis did not come from disaffected left-wing or centre-left voters, but from right-wing voters frustrated with the existing parties of the right.\n\nIn my view this point alone is decisive. The meaning of right-wing and left-wing is not an ahistorical abstraction, it’s created by the behaviour of people and institutions. The right-wing citizens of Germany implicitly recognised the Nazis as right-wing by voting for them, case closed.\n\nRead more about which parties Nazi voters defected from here: https://gking.harvard.edu/files/gking/files/nazivp.pdf\n\n2. The Nazis literally invented privatisation:\n\nThe Nazis were responsible for huge privatisation programs. The extent of their privatisations was enormous, but it was particularly vast when compared with other countries at the time, who were generally moving in the opposite direction. The privatisations of Nazi Germany may indeed have been the first mass privatisations of public property in history and included “Steel, mining, banking, shipyard, ship-lines, and railways.” More on how Nazis bucked historical trends by privatising when no one else was here: http://www.ub.edu/graap/nazi.pdf\n\n3. Nazi policies greatly increased income inequality:\n\nIncome inequality spiked under Hitler, as was observed even at the time. More here: http://piketty.pse.ens.fr/files/capitalisback/CountryData/Germany/Other/Pre1950Series/RefsHistoricalGermanAccounts/Sweezy39.pdf\n\n4. Capital as a share of factor income also spiked under Hitler, at the expense of wages:\n\nFactor income describes the division between the factors of production, with land receiving rent, capital receiving profit and labour receiving wages. The capital share, or profit as a proportion of total income, increased by about 50% in Nazi Germany and was much higher than the US’s capital share at the time. See the below graph from Capital in the Twenty-First Century reproduced in a Jacobin article by Corey Robin:\nI’m sorry if there’s not much in the way of Belles-lettres here. If I am blunt it is for a purpose. The Nazis were right-wing. Anyone who tells you otherwise is wrong, much in the same way it is wrong to say that the world is flat, six-thousand years old, or made of cheese.",

It's no coincidence that the 2 most racist and poor states in America are hard-core republican red states; Alabama and Mississippi. Mississippi is literally the most corrupt state in America atm",

The average German businessmen were allowed to keep their companies, as long as they didn't explicitly oppose the NSDAP.

In this respect I am a fanatical socialist, one who has ever in mind the interests of all his people.” \n\n– A. Hitler , February 24, 1941, speech on the 21st anniversary of the Nazi Party\n\n“All the more so after the war, the German National Socialist state, which pursued this goal from the beginning, will tirelessly work for the realization of a program that will ultimately lead to a complete elimination of class differences and to the creation of a true socialist community.” \n\n– A.

Yes of course they can\n\nHave they? Yes, admittedly I'm not a history buff but I'm pretty sure some of Stalin's actions are considered genocide, and Gaddafi was fucked up\n\nDoes that make communism, or anarchism comparable to fascism, or even capitalism? No, because fundamentally leftists fight to destroy power structures, to remove the mechanisms that make mass violence and systemic  violence possible, whereas capitalism and fascism fundamentally require systemic violence to assert the leader or leaders power\n\nHell all you have to do is look at protest culture on either side\nSocialists want rights what do they do? Organise labor strikes and stop going to work\n\nRight wingers THINK they're losing their rights what do they do? Form the KKK and publically lynch black folk and other minorities, starting a god damn civil war\n\nWhen leftists go on strike what do the capitalists do? Send in the police to brutalise the striking workers\n\nHorseshoe theory (the idea that as you go further left you get closer to the far right and vice versa) is bunk\n\nIf you're interested I can link you to a good video that explains it better than I just did",

If anything, the methods of maintaining power were not far away from what the nazis did (seeded distrust among society and locked away critiques). Also, the uniformity of the ideology among education, medicine and any other public institution and most importantly non-existent freedom of speech were very similar to the nazi era.\n\nIn terms of pure protest action today I am afraid I dont know. But seeing what is happening at G-7 or G-20 summits every few years is not funny. And that is mainly the left. I think a healthy country should not be run by any extremists and should be very careful keeping the extreme left and right in check.\nFeel free to link the video you mentioned though.",

Let me guess, you'll do it better?\n\nAnd, again, I never said capitalism was the solution to all the problems in the world. But most of the economic, energy and climate problems are being caused by sheer stupidity in my opinion. We have nuclear energy, which is the cleanest most efficient way to produce electricity we've ever come up with, but politicians don't see to like it. This is a long discussion that I don't feel like having right now, but suffice to say that I do believe the energy problem is caused because some group of stupid people who unfortunately have a lot of power and are both too ignorant and too greedy to realize we need to transition from oil to renewables. Maybe we can agree on at least that one thing?\n\nRussia free market???WTF!!!???? Russia is an autocracy controlled by Putin and the oligarchs that he allows to live. There is nothing that resembles free market there.\n\nAgain, you seem to portray me as an anarcho-capitalist, which I'm not. I believe balance is always the key. Making sure your country or business has enough gains to thrive while also making sure that your workers have a decent wage is ideal. And guess what? Only 1st world countries have made that possible on a massive scale because of the free market.\nAnyways, I do believe both extremes are bad either right or left-wing.\nBut communism is as bad as fascism and history has proven that.

You don't need to have a conflict with Jeff Bezos, because he is part of the same race-soul you see. You don't need a union to represent you, that is just causing unnecessary conflict. You're supposed to have more in common with Jeff Bezos than other dudes of similar class as you.\n\nFascism has some general themes, like national rebirth through war and revitalization from stagnation. The idea of a corrupt elite standing against the People, where the People conventiently agree with everything I want, and I have such a direct line to them that I don't need to ask them. It can be hard to define when it's this empty, like how I have a hard time to define the ideology of post-communist Russia. There is just nothing, a hollow nationalist shell with some religious values painted on. Just a raw belief in right through violence.\n\nI don't think you will ever find a nation adapting an ideology exactly the same way. If we think everything that isn't an exact copy of stalinist USSR or Germany under the NSDAP doesn't count it becomes very narrow. Then things get weird the moment we face Tito's Yugoslavia, Francist Spain and others.\n\nThere was some pretty big conflicts within the NSDAP, even if they were supposed to be one happy folk-soul. People who were more okay with nationalizing industries and got purged, the army trying to preserve their state within a state, the concentration of power to Himler etc. How they keep testing how much of the existing conservative welfare state dating back to Bismarck they can dismantle.",

So is Saudi Arabia socialist since they seize the wealth of \"corrupt\" (read as not suitably loyal enough) officials? Is ISIS socialist for confiscating goods from Kurds and non-muslims? Funnily enough you claim I used a fallacy when you used the fallacy fallacy, or the false calling of a fallacy in order to attempt to discredit an opponent without properly addressing the argument. Furthermore often times the goods that were confiscated from the \"untermench\" was reallocated often not to the state but to German companies or individuals, not to the state. Saying that there was more confiscation that Privitization is misleading at best since your mischaracterizing the situation. As for empowered socialist movements I think you are ignoring the Bolsheviks, several aspects of the French revolution, and about half the economic policies of modern European states.

        "text": "You did not present history as your argument, have you even addressed a single historical fact I've presented? Even the quote from you own source? \n\nI don't present as high a standard of support? Are you kidding? Its clear as day from who has actual sources and actually even read the article you yourself provided as your only source which said the opposite of your claim.  What context have you provided? Baseless statements without sources or evidence? In addition I've addressed every \"fact\" you provided and how its ridiculous and you haven't properly refuted my points or in many cases you haven't even addressed them. So if anyone is doing propaganda it is you.\n\nRead the quote i posted from your own source, he redefined socialist.  He even said actual socialists aren't socialist, \"I shall take Socialism away from the Socialists.\"  \n\nThis is what precludes naziism from socialism: \"Nazism attempted to reconcile conservative, nationalist ideology with a socially radical doctrine. In so doing, it became a profoundly revolutionary movement—albeit a largely negative one. Rejecting rationalism, liberalism, democracy, the rule of law, human rights, and all movements of international cooperation and peace, it stressed instinct, the subordination of the individual to the state, and the necessity of blind and unswerving obedience to leaders appointed from above. It also emphasized the inequality of men and races and the right of the strong to rule the weak; sought to purge or suppress competing political, religious, and social institutions; advanced an ethic of hardness and ferocity; and partly destroyed class distinctions by drawing into the movement misfits and failures from all social classes. Although socialism was traditionally an internationalist creed, the radical wing of Nazism knew that a mass base existed for policies that were simultaneously anticapitalist and nationalist. However, after Hitler secured power, this radical strain was eliminated.\" https://www.britannica.com/event/Nazism\nYou will note that from the definition of socialism (which i posted above as well and you haven't argued against) is: \"Socialism, social and economic doctrine that calls for public rather than private ownership or control of property and natural resources. According to the socialist view, individuals do not live or work in isolation but live in cooperation with one another. Furthermore, everything that people produce is in some sense a social product, and everyone who contributes to the production of a good is entitled to a share in it. Society as a whole, therefore, should own or at least control property for the benefit of all its members.\" https://www.britannica.com/topic/socialism   \nSo what precludes Naziism from Socialism is that bit about rejecting human rights (contrary to the \"... individuals do not live or work in isolation but live in cooperation with one another\"), Inequality of men and races (contrary to the same part above, \"...everyone who contributes to the production of a good is entitled to a share in it,\" and \"Society as a whole, therefore, should own or at least control property for the benefit of ALL its members.\" (capitalization mine)),  and that last bit of the first quote about \"Although socialism was traditionally an internationalist creed, the radical wing of Nazism knew that a mass base existed for policies that were simultaneously anticapitalist and nationalist. However, after Hitler secured power, this radical strain was eliminated.\"  \n\nThe jews did have a disproportionate amount of wealth based on population but only made up 13%-25% of the highest income, (https://www.uni-trier.de/fileadmin/fb4/prof/SOZ/APO/WindolfMS577June10.pdf) if the Nazis had been targeting all the rich then why were the other rich not targeted and only the jews? It was purely based on racism, the wealth was something the Nazi's capitalized on to demonize them and to help fill their coffers. Had it truely been an attack on all the wealthy of the German state then why were the Germans who were wealthy left alone, especially since they made up 75% of the wealthy? and you have provided no sources so again your claim of \"It is a position within the contemporary context of the nazi movement which I have provided you from the mouth of the leader of the movement\" doesn't hold water.\n\nNationalism isn't mutually exclusive with socialism, Fascism is. Its definitions shows as such; \"Although fascist parties and movements differed significantly from one another, they had many characteristics in common, including extreme militaristic nationalism, contempt for electoral democracy and political and cultural liberalism, a belief in natural social hierarchy and the rule of elites, and the desire to create a Volksgemeinschaft (German: “people’s community”), in which individual interests would be subordinated to the good of the nation.\"  Referring back again to the definition of socialism this doesn't fit as \"...a belief in natural social hierarchy and the rule of elites...\" is anathema to \"Furthermore, everything that people produce is in some sense a social product, and everyone who contributes to the production of a good is entitled to a share in it.\"  Additionally \"...the desire to create a Volksgemeinschaft (German: “people’s community”), in which individual interests would be subordinated to the good of the nation\" is not the same as \"Society as a whole, therefore, should own or at least control property for the benefit of all its members.\" One is where its for the benefit of the STATE and the other is for the benefit of ALL ITS MEMBERS, this is easily demonstrated as potentially contradictory as what benefited the US state in the 1700s was the enslavement of blacks, or members of the US society yet did not benefit them.  Also, \"Sounds like history will shit on that conjecture,\" you have to prove that statement as you are the one making an assertion and funnily enough all my above evidence proves the contrary. \n\nFinaly: \"Can you support that Hitler was some bowlerhatted, educated capitalist who was well connected in Germany? Hitler even has the makings of a socialist leader, is my point. For those who contend his sympathies were with capitalists, how is it supported?\" Straw man argument and red herring. Straw man since I never made such an assertion you are building a straw man to tear down (in fact I explicitly stated he used socialist and capitalist policies when they suited him politically to gain power) and red herring because the beginning part is irrelevant to him not being socialist.  Straw man: \"Substituting a person’s actual position or argument with a distorted, exaggerated, or misrepresented version of the position of the argument.\" (https://www.logicallyfallacious.com/tools/lp/Bo/LogicalFallacies/169/Strawman-Fallacy)  Red herring: \"Red herring is a kind of fallacy that is an irrelevant topic introduced in an argument to divert the attention of listeners or readers from the original issue. In literature, this fallacy is often used in detective or suspense novels to mislead readers or characters, or to induce them to make false conclusions.\" (https://literarydevices.net/red-herring/)\n\n(edited for clarity at the end. original: \"Straw man argument and red herring. Straw man since I never made such an assertion you are building a straw man to tear down and red herring because that is irrelevant to him not being socialist.\")",

        "text": "MajorLeague So he explicitly redefines the state to being only his preferred race, changing the definition. Again, he used some socialist policies when it suited his desire for power, having the business owners consider themselves a pointed by the state can technically be considered a socialist policy but is again a policy used by every dictator ever  because it increases their power. That also includes having a professional army as socialist then as they are employees of the state. Owning the right to their property again can technically be considered a socialist policy but again is something every dictator ever has done, including governments like the egyptian pharoahs that massively preceed what is considered the origin of socialist theory with the Communist manifesto from Marx and Engels. Again you also ignore the Privitization of companies to those loyal to the party the Nazis did. But considering all the other fallacious claims you've made and outright fallacies you've repeatedly used it's quite clear you have no intention to have an actually respectful debate on the facts and mearly try to continue propaganda. If you want to say this statement is wrong point out the fallacies I've used, address how the numerous fallacies I've pointed out aren't that (which I've clearly demonstrated in several cases and the others are obvious so good luck) and provide sources for your claims. Otherwise this is clearly pointless as you will continue to use fallacies, misleading statements, and \"facts\" I've demonstrated are false to continue to try to continue to broadcast your propaganda.",

        "text": "Three Arrows is an idiot im seeying the video. 1º the guy says \"who thinks hitler was a socialist is a demagogue\". So not very intelectual from him shows how a partizan hack he is. But continuing \"you dont know how i dislike having this conversations\" Yeah because youre a left wing fascist, fascists never like to argue. To your point i think Crowder is economically extreme right, he says things like \"taxation is theft\" which it is not always it is sometimes. He is not the smartest guy around so he is kind of confusing in some of what he says. Crowder was right in one point, germans accepted the socialist view that the top 1%, the jews, were stealing from them namely throw the international banking system. Thats the same rethoric as Bernie Sanders, going after the top 1% so yes, in the backbone its the same socialist ideology of the opressor (the top 1%) opressing the 99%. Your guy argues that the Nazis were on the right on the parlement. Ok in my country, the party at the right of my parlement is just a centrist party which talks trash about Trump, Bolsonaro and Orban. Ive got no right on my country and there was no right in Germany. Than your guy says those words of Hitler calling himself a socialist are fake. But i showed you a video of Hitler in 1940 saying he was an anti free capitalism guy !!! What is the name of someone who is anti free capitalism? A left winger!! Than he cites a nazi leader as calling everyone inequal. Thats not a right wing of left wing ideology saying there are people with more rights than others thought i could argue its a left wing ideology as in the USA the left argues whites should have less previleges like for example black guys need a lower score to enter in the university than white guys and that was a left wing policy to threat people inequality based in the color of their skin. 11mns \"Hitlers priority was jobs throw inftrastructure constrction\" meaning jobs throw the state a keyzian left wing policy. Thanks for confirming what i said. Than he says \"Hitler did not allow wages to rise with prices\" Thanks again for confirming what i already had told you, it was the Nazis the state who decided the wages. You didnt want to believe, there it is. State planned economy. Than he argues the autobahn did not have the promissed public workers.Ok so? Germany got to full employment levels, the State hired for gun production, still goes to the point of a state controlled economy. Ok so Hitler was not found of communism. And? Communism was a threat for his power, he went after everyone who was a threat to his power even nazi colleges. Than your guy says \"there were price restrictions\", again in Venezuela also. Thats an anti free capitalism state planned economy policy Hitler printed money not fiscaly conservative. Another left wing policy. Oh the means of production remained in private hands, and so nazism could not have been in the left. DEBUNKED unless you think everything that is not communism is right wing. Private companies were to fullfil the wishes of the Nazis. Another thing i said and you didnt want to believe. That is the base of the national socialist fascist economy, companies can be private as long as they do the bidding of the state.Than he argues \"oh but the nazis were planing an economy for war so we cant compare to todays capitalism societys\" ok and what is the USA society, isnt it capitalistic and yet the strongest military force with 16% of GDP going to the military complex? Again, debunked. Than he says nazis were not against the productive capitalism they were against the finantial capitalism. True. They were against what was the top 1% the jews!. And than he says it didnt take long to that to tangle itself to the antisemetic rethoric. Completely true that is what i already told you. Than he says that was \"paranoia\", not it was not paranoia, its the same ideology behind Bernie Sanders. Envy of the rich, calling them opressors. Than he argues the nazis privatized some companies like from owning 52% going to 25% ownership thus not having any power anymore. Thats wrong. Search for the ore mining companies where Hitler gave the order to them to mine the german ore dispite being private. Than your guy says nazism doesnt resemble free capitalism. Ok but a total free capitalist economy is the most far right ideology, so i can the guy argue it is not? Nazis nationalized healthcare. ok. He says Crowder is not being correct on the nazis promoting abortion but abortion of races they deemed inferior. I can give that to him, as i know it was the nazi policy to increase the german population, Crowder may be wrong there. He asks if is there anyone pushing for penalizing who does not believe in climate change? Give it enough time. We already are seeying in Canada laws to lock up people who \"misspronunce\" someone. Give anough time and power to the left the democratic party already tried to push \"hate speech\" laws. Than he claims the nazis killed a lot of lgbt people. False. At least lesbians i know werent persecuted, let alone killed. Completely false argument. Crowder says Hitler was a soclalist liberal, because he wanted big government. Your guy says \"its embaracing to him\" Why??? ok so Hitler was against Marx ideas, so your guy claims that means he wasnt on the left. Wtf? What kind of logic is that? Anything that is not communism is on the right is that it? And accuses him, Crowder of being a demagogue. Than he claims the nazis pushed for conservative values. Ok what conservative values? Nothing said. Than he says for Hitler economics was of secondary importance subordinated to politics. Thank you. Thats national socialism, allowing private ownership as long they do the biding of the State. Free economic capitalist replaced for State interest. Yes! Right wing ideology replaced by a Left wing ideology. Than its presented the Nazi program which Dinesh says its on the left, your guy says \"oh but nazis were on the right because: \"They were nationalistic\" FALSE. Gandhi and Mandela were left extremists and nationalistic. \"because Hitler was anti Marx\" FALSE. Being on the left is believing in the powerful state, the fact Hitler did not believe in the revolution of the masses of equality of all people, does not mean he didnt believe in the core belief of the Left a powerful State. \"Nazis were anti-semitic\" Ok that makes nazis in the right why?? Demagogue \"Nazis were expantionistic\" Thats on the right why??? Being pro-war is not a thing of the left or the right per se.",

They had to have a socialist appeal, because at that time communism through the spartakists was rising in Germany. Again, the right do protectionism, controlling everything is not a communist trait, not at all. A very strong and important state controlled by one parti is not inherently communist. Again, both ideologies tend to totalitarianism. \nHistorically, it started as a socialist driven party. But Hitler was always a fascist : the failed putsch is the most revealing proof(then the long knifes night) . The socialist aspect was a way to make people adhere to his ideas(and be elected), it's just basic populism. During 1920's, the party associated with big companies, the anti capitalist aspect disappeared,it was no longer the party of the workers.",

Let’s hear from his own words:\n\n\nHitler on Marxism\n“National Socialism derives from each of the two camps the pure idea that characterizes it, national resolution from bourgeois tradition; vital, creative socialism from the teaching of Marxism.” – \n\nJanuary 27, 1934, interview with Hanns Johst in Frankforter Volksblatt\n\nHitler on Teaching Socialism\n“There is a difference between the theoretical knowledge of socialism and the practical life of socialism. People are not born socialists, but must first be taught how to become them.” – \n\nOctober 5, 1937, speech in Berlin\n\nHitler on Capitalism\n“In those countries, it is actually capital that rules; that is, nothing more than a clique of a few hundred men who possess untold wealth and, as a consequence of the peculiar structure of their national life, are more or less independent and free. They say: ‘Here we have liberty.’ By this they mean, above all, an uncontrolled economy, and by an uncontrolled economy, the freedom not only to acquire capital but to make absolutely free use of it. That means freedom from national control or control by the people both in the acquisition of capital and in its employment. This is really what they mean when they speak of liberty. These capitalists create their own press and then speak of the ‘freedom of the press.’ In reality, every one of the newspapers has a master, and in every case this master is the capitalist, the owner. This master, not the editor, is the one who directs the policy of the paper. If the editor tries to write other than what suits the master, he is ousted the next day. This press, which is the absolutely submissive and characterless slave of the owners, molds public opinion. Yes, certainly, we jeopardize the liberty to profiteer at the expense of the community, and, if necessary, we even abolish it.” – \n\nDecember 10, 1940, speech in Berlin\n\nHitler on Socialism\n“Socialism as the final concept of duty, the ethical duty of work, not just for oneself but also for one’s fellow man’s sake, and above all the principle: Common good before own good, a struggle against all parasitism and especially against easy and unearned income.

He saw socialism/communism as the primary enemies of this goal AND he saw them as inherently Jewish projects. The first people rounded up by Hitler and imprisoned, tortured, killed were communists. He had both racial and political goals, but they were intricately related. So in that sense we're also both correct haha. As for socialism doesn't equal communism...  That's complicated — from a Marxist perspective, socialism is a stage on the road to building communism so they're part of the same political project.

He himself called himself a socialist in his Second Book. Hitler of course, was wrong, Marxist socialism is inherently anti Jewish, but that's a topic for another day. And then for obvious reasons he hated Capitalism, because he thought it was part of the Jewish plot to take over the world. Socialism is an Umbrella Term, this is not to say that Marx and Hitler had the same idea completely.\n\nAs for book recommendations, I'd read Vampire Economy, The coming of the third Reich (Although Evans claims that nazism isn't socialism, because he thinks socialism has something to do with class, but other than that it's decent) and for obvious reasons I would read Mein Kampf and Hitlers Second Book (all should be available as pdfs online) \n\nAlso Sanders style socialism is socialism, and it has nothing to do with the Nordic style socialism (which is apparently one of the freest economically, weird isn't it?) Sanders is completely out of touch with reality here.",

        "text": "MajorLeague The text (in spanish sorry):\n\nMuchos defensores de la tesis de que la Alemania nazi era socialista sostienen que, aunque existía propiedad privada de los medios de producción, esta estaba supeditada al Estado, es decir, era meramente nominal. Esto no es cierto, como señalan Buchheim y Scherner (2006):\n\n ❝La propiedad privada en la industria del Tercer Reich es a menudo considerada una mera disposición nominal sin mucha sustancia. Sin embargo, eso no es correcto, porque las empresas, a pesar del racionamiento y actividades de licenciamiento del Estado, todavía tenían amplio alcance para diseñar sus propios perfiles de producción e inversión. Incluso con respecto a proyectos relacionados con la guerra, la libertad de contratación se respetó en general; en lugar de usar la fuerza, el Estado ofreció a las empresas una serie de opciones de contrato para elegir. Había varios motivos detrás de esta actitud del régimen, entre ellos la convicción de que la propiedad privada proporciona incentivos importantes para aumentar la eficiencia.❞ (pp. 390).\n\nLas empresas privadas durante la Alemania nazi tenían libertad para rechazar los proyectos estatales, sin ninguna consecuencia o sin temor a sufrir represalias o ser nacionalizadas. E incluso, en algunas ocasiones, como en el caso de Froriep GmbH, el Estado acataba las decisiones de las empresas privadas:\n\n ❝Las empresas normalmente podrían negarse a participar en un proyecto de inversión diseñado por el Estado, sin ninguna consecuencia. Hay bastantes casos en que lo hicieron, incluso después de la implementación del plan de cuatro años y el comienzo de la guerra, ambos considerados en algunas publicaciones como cruciales en la política económica del régimen. Y, de hecho, la retórica a veces pudo haberse vuelto más agresiva después de 1936. Pero el comportamiento real del Estado nazi en las relaciones con las empresas privadas parece no haber cambiado, porque las empresas continuaron actuando sin ningún tipo de temor a ser nacionalizadas o puestas de otra manera bajo una presión insoportable.\n\n Así, de Wendel, una empresa minera de carbón, se negó a construir otra planta de hidrogenación en 1937. En la primavera de 1939 IG Farben rechazó una solicitud del Ministerio de Economía para ampliar su producción de rayón para el uso en neumáticos. Tampoco estaba preparado para invertir una cantidad sustancial en una tercera fábrica en Fürstenberg/Oder de buna (caucho sintético), aunque este era un proyecto de gran urgencia para el régimen. Otro ejemplo interesante es el de Froriep GmbH, una empresa que producía máquinas para el armamento y las industrias relacionadas con la autarquía, que también encontraron un mercado listo en el exterior. En la segunda mitad de la década de 1930 la demanda de los propósitos anteriores era tan alta que las exportaciones amenazaban con ser totalmente desplazadas. Por lo tanto, la compañía planificó una ampliación de la capacidad, pero solicitó al Reich que compartiera el riesgo otorgando un crédito subsidiado y permitiendo cargas de depreciación excepcionales para reducir su carga impositiva. Cuando la última demanda no fue aceptada al principio, la empresa reaccionó al negarse a invertir. Entonces, al final, el Estado se rindió por completo a las solicitudes de la empresa.❞ (Buchheim y Scherner, 2006, pp. 401-402).\n\nLas empresas privadas actuaron con sus inversiones sabiendo que los nazis nunca implantarían un sistema económico socialista:\n\n❝El comportamiento de las empresas en todos estos casos también demostró que previeron la eventual reducción del intervencionismo y de la demanda estatal, que conduciría a la reaparición de una economía de mercado y a una mayor competencia. Si hubiera sido de otra manera, la formación de expectativas a largo plazo diferente de las expectativas a corto plazo habría sido sin sentido. Por lo tanto, la industria misma no consideró que el desarrollo del sistema económico nazi se dirigía hacia la planificación central y el socialismo. Más bien, el papel muy importante del Estado en la preguerra y en la economía de guerra se consideraba relacionada con la guerra- y por lo tanto temporal.❞ (Buchheim y Scherner, 2006, pp. 405).\n\nEn 1939, solamente la empresa privada IG Farben controlaba el 25% de los trabajadores de la industria química alemana, el 33% del capital nominal de ese sector, el 33% de la producción y el 66% de las exportaciones, sin tener en cuenta sus filiales extranjeras en Suiza y Suecia o sus contratos con la Standard Oil (Crouzet, 1961). Los beneficios empresariales de las empresas privadas como Krupp o IG Farben crecieron considerablemente durante el nazismo.\n\nLas filiales alemanas de las empresas privadas General Motors y Ford Motor Company poseían el 70% del mercado automovilístico alemán en 1939 (Agosto, 2008), además de suministrar material bélico a la Wehrmacht durante la Segunda Guerra Mundial (Agosto, 2008). Göring por su parte, dejó que las empresas privadas financiarían la industria de la aviación para que la iniciativa privada se fortaleciera (Buchheim y Scherner, 2006). Es por ello, que no era raro que empresas privadas de la aviación militar como Messerschmitt AG, Ernst Heinkel Flugzeugwerke AG o Junkers Flugzeug- und Motorenwerke AG fueran los principales proveedores de la Luftwaffe.\n\nA diferencia de lo que se cree, la Alemania nazi no llevó una política autárquica, en cambio aumenta sus relaciones comerciales con distintos países como Bulgaria, Hungría, Grecia, Rumanía, Yugoslavia o Turquía.\n\nTambién esto ocurre en Latinoamérica. Entre 1932 y 1937 el volumen de las exportaciones alemanas a esa región se cuadriplica y para 1936 Alemania se convierte en el principal proveedor de Chile y Brasil, así como el segundo de Perú, Bolivia, Venezuela, Guatemala y México (Crouzet, 1961).\n\nLa Alemania nazi aumentó sus relaciones comerciales con prácticamente todos los países, salvo excepciones como la Unión Soviética, durante el periodo previo a la Segunda Guerra Mundial.\n\nPor último, cabe destacar que los que realmente ganaron con la llegada de los nazis fueron los grandes capitalistas alemanes. Los salarios reales por hora de los trabajadores alemanes entre 1933 y 1939 crecieron solo alrededor de un 7,41% (Kirk, 1995), mientras que los salarios semanales reales crecieron cerca de un 20,11% (Kirk, 1995), esto fue el resultado del aumento de las horas de trabajo. Mientras tanto, el PIB per cápita en ese periodo creció un 54,53% (Maddison, 1997). El resto de crecimiento que no fue a parar a los salarios de los trabajadores fue, por defecto, al rendimiento del capital, que como se puede ver en esta gráfica del libro The Wages of Destruction: The Making and Breaking of the Nazi Economy (2006) de Adam Tooze (pp. 109), creció de forma espectacular durante el nazismo. Como resultado de esto, la desigualdad de ingresos rápidamente aumentó con los nazis. Entre 1933 y 1938, el 10% más rico de Alemania pasó de poseer el 11% de la renta nacional, a poseer el 16% (Atkinson y Piketty, 2007). Por su parte el 0,01% más rico, entre ellos los grandes capitalistas, pasaron, en el mismo periodo, de poseer el 1,25% de la renta nacional a poseer el 2,5%, un aumento del 100% (Atkinson y Piketty, 2007). El aumento en la desigualdad fue debido a que el rendimiento del capital fue mayor al crecimiento económico (r>g). Como señala Piketty (2014):\n\n❝Es interesante señalar que la participación del decil superior progresó mucho en Alemania entre 1933 y 1938, totalmente a contracorriente de los demás países: esta situación refleja sobremanera el aumento de los beneficios industriales (estimulados por los pedidos gubernamentales a la industria de armamento) y, de manera más general, el restablecimiento de las jerarquías de ingresos características del periodo nazi.❞ (pp. 357).",

You need to clarify your ideas before starting a discussion.\n\n\"The nazi Germany was not business friendly\". Sure, tell Henry Ford, Hugo Boss or Ferdinand Porsche among others.\n\n\"The nazis were socialists like the name said\". Most retard argument ever. By that logic North Korea is a democratic country.\n\n\"In other words, history, not me, calls nazis socialist\". Maybe in your fantasy world. In real world the vast majority of historians agree that the Nazis were not socialists, and the few who claim that they were socialists are right-wingers who don't want to assume that their ideological \"brothers\" did some atrocities. Richard Evans, in his three-volume history of Nazi Germany, is quite clear on whether Hitler was a socialist: “It would be wrong to see Nazism as a form of, or an outgrowth of, socialism.” Izidoro Blikstein, professor of Linguistics and Semiotics at USP and an expert in analysis of Nazi and totalitarian discourse, said: \"Affirm that the Nazis were socialists is a great ignorance of history and how things happened\"\n\n\"Can you give me an example of a marxist organization in German history which aligned with the term socialist as nazis did?\". Didn't you read that famous interview with Hitler in which the first thing the journalist asks to him is: \"\"Why do you call yourself a National Socialist, since your party programme is the very antithesis of that commonly accredited to socialism?\" and Hitler literally replied: \"We might have called ourselves the Liberal Party. We chose to call ourselves the National Socialists\". Yeah, it seems that the name of the party was really important to him and was carefully chosen to reflect his ideas......\n\n\"Are you sure you know what you're talking about?\". I was thinking the same about you.\n\n\"From reading history and studying economics or from being pitched by socialist politicians?\". So this is a conspiracy of socialist politicians to convince people about what exactly? that the Nazis were right-wing people who did some left-wing stuff? Ridiculous. Sorry to say but you're starting to sound like a lunatic. Look, the husband of a friend of mine is a neo-Nazi and I have talked a lot with him about this subject. I can assure you that he is not the typical retarded neo-Nazi who likes the Nazis \"just because they were racist\". He knows perfectly the \"Nazi philosophy\" and has read lots of books on the subject, and you know what? even he admits that the Nazis started being anti-capitalist and ended up being capitalist.",

        "text": "MajorLeague The Nazis were openly opposed in the Reichstag by the left wing Social Democrat and the moderate Center Party, and allied with the firmly right-wing militarists, blood and soil nutters, and the Freikorps. Even contemporary German newspapers described the Nazis as right-wing. In Volker Ullrich's Hitler biography he states that Hitler was always fundamentally far-right and that he adopted socialist language and some policy as a purely opportunistic move to attract working-class people to what was at the time called the German Worker's Party, but whose social base came from the middle classes.\n\nWhat Hitler called \"the real socialism\" only existed in his head. Pretending that he was a socialist when he defended the opposite of socialism and even wanted to eradicate socialism, doesn't seem very socialist. If I now affirm that real socialism is capitalist and bourgeois, would you also buy the idea that I have \"my own version of socialism\" and that I am a socialist? sorry but that seems a bit naive.\n\nYou haven't answered my question why you think they were right-wing. I think you're starting to regret saying that.\n\nHonestly, this conversation is starting to bore me A LOT. I feel like I'm talking to a wall. To end my participation and since you can read in spanish, I'm going to copy an article published in a Spanish right-wing newspaper called ABC, just to prove how absurd is the idea that only lefties say the Nazis were far-right:\n\nASÍ ALCANZARON LOS NAZIS EL PODER\n\nEn 1933 el Partido Nazi alcanza el poder. De ser una minoritaria «banda de desarrapados y pistoleros», cuyos integrantes cabían todos en una cervecería y limitaban su actuación a Baviera, se ha convertido en uno de los fenómenos de masas más importantes que se haya conocido. ¿Cómo fue posible?\n\nTras el final de la Gran Guerra, son muchos los grupúsculos de extrema derecha activos en Alemania. Aun diferentes, todos comparten unas característi-cas comunes: el rechazo frontal al Tratado de Versallesy las condiciones de paz y la oposición radical a la democracia que encarna la República de Weimar, a la que quieren derrocar y sustituir por un régimen de corte autoritario. \n\nEl Partido Obrero Alemán Nacional Socialista (NSDAP, en sus siglas, o Partido Nazi), fundado por Anton Drexler en enero de 1919, es uno más de ellos. Ni el más numeroso, ni el más fuerte, ni el más importante. Muy por delante en el ranking se encuentran dos organizaciones bien diferenciadas: los Stahlhelm o Cascos de Acero y el Partido Nacionalista del Pueblo Alemán o DNVP.\n\nEl «Stahlhelm» y el DNPV\n\nFundado por Franz Seldte como una «organización social» y apolítica, el Stahlhelm se constituye como una entidad formada por veteranos de la Gran Guerra y ultranacionalistas, financiada por industriales y terratenientes alemanes, cuyo fin principal es la asistencia económica a los excombatientes.\n\nLa realidad era harto diferente; el Stahlhelm se articula como una milicia paramilitar cuyo objetivo último es el derrocamiento de la República, aunque, paradójicamente, sirvió de reserva y apoyo al ejército de la misma: el Reichswher.\n\nAlimentado por los integrantes de los disueltos «Freikorps», el Stahlhelm fue durante la década de los años veinte el más poderoso de los grupos de la extrema derecha germanos y el preferido por Mussolini, que lo veía como su aliado natural en Alemania.\n\nSin embargo, con la llegada de Hitler al poder en 1933, el Stahlhelm es paulatinamente integrado —no sin oposición— en la estructura del Partido Nazi y para 1934 había desaparecido como entidad independiente.\n\nPor su parte, el DNVP era el principal partido de la derecha nacionalista alemana, que había obtenido un gran respaldo popular durante los primeros procesos electorales de la República y, aunque integrado en el sistema, nunca aceptó realmente la legitimidad democrática. Su postura se fue radicalizando al tiempo que perdía apoyos populares.\n\nTanto su alianza ocasional con los nazis en el parlamento alemán como su radicalización tuvieron como consecuencia su gradual desaparición, siendo sus militantes y su masa electoral absorbida por el partido de Hitler, que, con un discurso intransigente, dinámico y «atractivo», cautivaba cada vez a más sectores, no sólo del electorado de la ultraderecha, sino de todas las capas de la sociedad.\n\nEl ascenso nazi\n\nEl giro de una gran parte de la derecha germana hacia posturas autoritarias y extremistas favorece el ascenso nacionalsocialista. El crecimiento del Partido Nazi bajo el liderazgo de Adolf Hitler desde 1921, es continuo.\n\nCautivador en su oratoria y puesta en escena, su retórica ultranacionalista, revisionista y antisemita le ganan el respaldo de una base social cada vez más amplia y heterogénea: militantes de otros partidos de ultraderecha, pero también empresarios, obreros, campesinos y clases medias.\n\nEl uso moderno de la propaganda y la violencia política son sus otras dos armas. Además, tras la fracasada experiencia del «Putsch» de Múnich, los dirigentes nazis están convencidos de la necesidad de desbordar la República desde dentro, participando y utilizando a su favor las instituciones republicanas. La aceptación momentánea de las reglas democráticas le dará además al partido el plus de respetabilidad del que hasta entonces carecía.\n\nEl resentimiento por la ocupación francesa del Ruhr y las sucesivas crisis económicas de 1923 y 1929 incrementan aún más la base electoral de Hitler: En las elecciones de 1932 los nazis, con un tercio de todos los votos, son el partido más votado de Alemania. Con tal apoyo popular y el sustento de otras fuerzas del centro y la derecha, que piensan pueden «domesticarlo» una vez que cate las «mieles del poder», Hitler es nombrado canciller por el presidente Hindenburg en enero de 1933.",

        "text": "MajorLeague  your error is one of fact, not interpretation. Any analysis of the electoral platforms, internal party dynamics and political actions of the Nazis between 1921 and 1945 makes this clear. Perhaps the German Workers Party - the party of around 100 members led by Anton Drexler that preceded the Nazi Party (NSDAP) - might have sought to cobble authoritarian anti-capitalism (which is not the same as socialism) onto biological racism. The early, pre-Nazi party that Hitler joined toyed with forms of market control to benefit small businesses and to halt ostensible \"foreign\" - that is, Jewish - control over markets. But such dalliances would not last long. Yes, Mussolini had been a socialist early during the First World War, but broke with his comrades to support Italian expansionism, and then formed his fascist party to crush them. As in fascist Italy, Nazi ideas were self-consciously formulated to negate those of the left, not to imitate them. When Hitler took over the party in 1921, he shredded the anti-capitalist parts of the old party's platform.This was a politics forged in the late days of the German revolution, when Hitler began to imagine Germany assailed by a double threat of Jews and Bolsheviks emanating from the Russian east: \"Judeo-Bolshevism.\" This position would undergird the foreign policy aspects of Mein Kampf. Far from supporting anti-colonial movements at the time, as did socialists around the world, he admired the British Empire as a paragon of \"Aryan\" rule over inferiors, and hoped to cooperate with the British in rescuing Western civilization from Soviet \"Asiatic\" barbarism.Under Hitler the party looked squarely to the middle classes and farmers rather than the working class for a political base. Hitler realigned it to ensure that it was an anti-socialist, anti-liberal, authoritarian, pro-business party - particularly after the failed Beerhall Putsch of 1923. The \"socialism\" in the name National Socialism was a strategically chosen misnomer designed to attract working class votes where possible, but they refused to take the bait. The vast majority voted for the Communist or Social Democratic parties.The minority anti-capitalist strand of Nazism (Strasserism) on which fastens was eliminated well before 1934, when Gregor Strasser and the Storm Trooper (SA) leader Ernst Roehm were murdered with over eighty others in the \"Night of the Long Knives.\" In fact, Strasserism had already been defeated at the Bamberg Conference of 1926 when the Nazis were polling under 3% of the vote. Here, Hitler brought the dissidents back into line, denouncing them as \"communists\" and ruling out land expropriations and grassroots decision-making. He heightened the party's alliance with businesses small and large, and insisted on the absolute centralisation of decision-making - the \"Fuehrer (leader) Principle.\"\nWhen the already isolated Strasser brothers tried to reinvigorate their project one last time in 1930, Hitler and Goebbels banded together to force Otto Strasser to leave the party and Gregor Strasser to publicly recant. When the first electoral breakthrough to a popular vote of 18% came in 1930, the Nazi party's anti-capitalist minority were well and truly defeated. The \"Night of the Long Knives\" purged the old SA, not because they were a hidden vestige of socialism, but because Roehm's army of street thugs were a potential threat to Hitler's personal consolidation of power. A struggle over socialism in the Nazi party played absolutely no role in the purge of 1934.For their part, businesses welcomed the Nazis' promises to suppress the left. On 20 February 1933, Hitler and Goering met with a large group of industrialists when Hitler declared that democracy and business were incompatible and that the workers needed to be dragged away from socialism. He promised bold action to protect their businesses and property from communism. The industrialists - including leading figures from I.G. Farben, Hoesch, Krupp, Siemens, Allianz and other senior mining and manufacturing groups - then contributed more than two million Reichsmarks",

        "text": "MajorLeague also a form of socialism/fascism, one wonders?)Herewith we come to the effect, if not the point, of the revisionist exposition: it is not only to transfer the stigma of the Second World War's genocidal violence from the right to the left, so that criticisms of racialized populism can be dismissed as \"leftist fascism.\" It is also to suggest that the war was a crusade against state collectivism of all types - including the welfare state for which many Westerners, in fact, fought. They reason by means of a simplistic, ahistorical syllogism: since socialism is statism/collectivism (like public health and public transport), and Nazism was statist/collectivist (and promoted public health and public transport), social democratic public health and public transport measures must be fascist.The war against welfare states\nNeedless to say, this is a perverse and pernicious misinterpretation of historical facts. The Atlantic Charter, declared by U.S. President Roosevelt and British Prime Minister Churchill in 1941, set out the principles of the post-war order, which included the \"advancement of social welfare\" and working \"for a world free of want and fear.\" A year later, the British Beveridge Report on social welfare met such popular support that a reluctant cabinet felt compelled to accept it. When the war ended, the people promptly replaced Churchill's government with a Labour one to implement its recommendations.Three years later, the United Nations Declaration of Human Rights, inspired by the Atlantic Charter, reflected the Zeitgeist in Article 25: \"Everyone has the right to a standard of living adequate for the health and wellbeing of himself and his family including food, clothing, housing and medical care and necessary social services, and the right to security in the event of unemployment, sickness, disability, widowhood, old age or other lack of livelihood.\" Welfare states were thus established or extended after the war. They have now been under concerted attack since the 1970s. Governments across the Western world are still deregulating, imposing austerity and attacking unions to further increase business profit margins. The emergence of leaders like Trump around the globe signals an intensification of this tendency.Worried by the popularity among young people of politicians like Jeremy Corbyn and Bernie Sanders who oppose these tendencies, however, the corporate and media sponsors of the attacks on the welfare state now seek to discredit the social democratic platform by disparaging it as historically fascist. That is also why they attack reputable sources of news like the ABC, and why they seek at once to discredit universities as \"politically correct\" and to pervert their mission by inserting into them privatised think thanks espousing Hayakian ideology. So, too, they proffer the perverse thesis of fascism-as-socialism, finding ready adherents in right-wing corners of the twittersphere and in business circles.The collective ignorance displayed by this revisionist commentariat is proportionally related to the outlandishness of its historical interpretations and its sophomoric ignorance of the recent history of Western civilization.The revisionists likely neither know nor care that the monument erected to the German strikers who lost their lives confronting the Kapp Putsch was ritually destroyed by the Nazis in 1936. But others do. Whether those who remember the past can confront the slow-motion putsch against welfare states and the historical experiences of the catastrophic twentieth century that spawned them remains an open question.",

        "text": "MajorLeague I'm going to post one more thing because I think this is interesting. This is about Gregor Strasser and it’s on his German wikipedia file:\n\n\"Despite his reputation as a representative of the left within the NSDAP, Strasser had had good contacts with entrepreneurial circles since the beginning of the thirties, whose ideas of taming the NSDAP by integrating him into government responsibility met him. The German Fuehrer Letters, a private correspondence under the influence of the industrialist Paul Silverberg, praised Strasser in May 1932 because he advocated a \"transfer of the N.S.D.A.P. from the opposition to the governmental position \". To prove his party's ability to govern, Strasser announced on October 20, 1932 in the Berlin Sports Palace the new \"economic reconstruction program\" of the NSDAP. In it, the shrill anti-capitalist tones and the demands for a self-sufficiency of Germany were clearly withdrawn, as they had been among others in his own \"economic emergency program\" of July 1932 still loud. Instead of tax increases for the rich, he now demanded tax cuts, and instead of price controls, he wanted to fight deflation with a price liberalization. Although he continued to speak in favor of agricultural protectionism and priority for German products, he emphasized at the same time that exports should not be hindered. To overcome mass unemployment, he proposed abandoning the Reichsmark's bond with gold, nationalizing the banks and facilitating public employment through massive government borrowing. In the same year he expressed himself in an interview with the American journalist Hubert Renfro Knickerbocker *extremely business-friendly* :\n\n\"We recognize private property. We accept the private initiative. We recognize our debt and our commitment to pay for it. We are against the nationalization of the industry. We are against the nationalization of trade. We are against the planned economy in the Soviet sense.\"\n\nAlso Gottfried Feder in his _Manifesto for the abolition of interest slavery_ was hard against the socialization of the means of production:\n\n\"The essential demand of the Erfurt Program (the transfer of the means of production from private ownership into the ownership and operation of the community) has today been compressed into the cry for \"socialization.\" It is completely clear to every serious politician that full socialization of our economic ruin would mean complete state bankruptcy. But one dare not confess this openly and freely to the people. Not socialization but desocialization would have to be the motto now\"",

What the Nazis did was totally separate from their policy decisions. Are socialists nazis, because the Nazis claimed to be socialist? First of all, they didn't. And second, if they did claim that then they are the worst socialists in history. The nazi's wanted to kill Jews and use science to further their military goals. In the process of doing so, they made a lot of bad people very rich off of the wealth they stole. This isn't rocket science. Even the most basic of anti-nazi propaganda in modern pop culture knows this. Nazis are not left wing. Attempting to radically change the definition of Leftist as being even marginally comparable to Nazis is completely idiotic. Nazis want to make a society that benefits \"gifted\" individuals. Socialists want a society that benefits everyone. There could not be two parties more opposite really.",

And we were aware that in this fight we can rely on no one but our own people. We are convinced that socialism in the right sense will only be possible in nations and races that are Aryan, and there in the first place we hope for our own people and are convinced that socialism is inseparable from nationalism.” \n\n– A. Hitler , August 15, 1920, speech in Munich at the Hofbräuhaus.\n\n“Germany’s economic policy is conducted exclusively in accordance with the interests of the German people. In this respect I am a fanatical socialist, one who has ever in mind the interests of all his people.” \n\n– A. Hitler , February 24, 1941, speech on the 21st anniversary of the Nazi Party\n\n“All the more so after the war, the German National Socialist state, which pursued this goal from the beginning, will tirelessly work for the realization of a program that will ultimately lead to a complete elimination of class differences and to the creation of a true socialist community.” \n\n– A.

When Hitler won the power struggle within the party he had all the Strasserites kicked out, spent many hours reassuring corporate interests he was their ally, and during the Night of Long Knives had their former leader, Otto Strasser, assassinated. Virtually none of the 25 point programme was enacted when the Nazis were in power, and as the video demonstrates they were overwhelmingly right-wing/capitalist.

There's a good reason to say but, because everything requires at least some degree of nuance. \nRainer Zeitelmann not contributing much to science and being a self help guru doesn't mean anything about his history works, which have been heavily praised in the academic community except by a select few, a select few he retorts in his recent edition of his book.

TIK and I disagree on that, but agree on this: The NSDAP economy was left wing. In terms of economic policies, it leans pretty well into the left, right of Stalin and Lenin but left of Roosevelt. Furthermore you're making a false equivalency. Other states regulate, but to a far lesser degree and for very different reasons than why the TR did it. You're looking at similarities without seeing context or scope or frequency, a failing Hayes excellently called out Buchheim on. My main thing on the NSDAP economy is that the left is more incorrect than the right on this subject and is relying on outdated Soviet historiography. The capitalism in decay model. Primacy of economics. Seeing The Vampire Economy and many primary and secondary sources, it was constantly remarked on how regulated the economy of the TR was. Why would people be commenting on this if it was just standard for all economies? It's because the scope, context and frequency was drastically different. The economy of the TR is most similar to that of China, a country that many far leftists even today praise. Tankies. Peer reviewed case studies have been done on the room for maneuver in the TR, and these historians found Peter Hayes had a far better case than Buchheim. I can link. Historians have compared and contrasted the economies of the TR and other contemporary western countries, and found other western countries were far less centralized and more willing to let private enterprise have far more autonomy than that of the TR. You're being disingenuous for the sake of ideology, something you're accusing TIK of. You think economic regulation, Socialism and leftism are good, therefore the evil TR must not be associated with these today or it looks bad. And I'm saying this as a guy who's a social corporatist. \nThe NSDAP by the mid 20s had a clear economic ideology. It was in the program and Rainer Zeitelmann more than demonstrated it in his book. These programs weren't enacted not out of ideological inconsistency, but out of pragmatism. The NSDAP, as Evans says, needed money. So they couldn't nationalize the banks. But he himself says they subjected banks to heavy regulation. Regulation was part of NSDAP ideology. Several H quotes prove this as does the program. As time went on, as Rainer proves, H got more admiring of the USSR overtime and admired their planned economy.  \nYou're framing it in too easy a light. The article makes clear while some room for maneuver was maintained, outside the firms all control no longer existed, far less than that of the Weimar days. Weimar wasn't a laissez Faire paradise either. Furthermore you intentionally ignore nationalization done by the NSDAP.",

I was a leftist and to this day I still hold many leftist ideas unlike TIK, and I butchered Wikipedia articles (the vandalism remains to this day) and wasted all that time on what was truly nonsense. I was doing it out of insecurity in my ideology, I was angry and scared when people compared leftism and National Socialism. It made me feel insecure. And i hyper obsessed with with Socialism part. The same arguments you're using now I used before, I even used the sources one against TIK without ever having read the sources. They were written by right wing men therefore they're bad. But I never retorted the substance. It was during this time i had a deep feeling my ideas on National Socialism made zero sense. Then it all shattered when I read Richard Evans trilogy. That book completely changed my view on it. The left had it completely wrong. The right isn't even 65 percent correct but they were more correct on this particular topic than the right. The totalitarianism model and capitalism in decay model are both heavily outdated, but the former was better than the latter, as Timothy Mason showed. Now we have more nuanced views, Hayes being the best, and that's the view I share today.",

        "text": "@teutonicterror0322 \nAs for your first comment, it's mainly restating things so my comment will be brief in response \nCan't really respond to first paragraph since we're coming at this on so different a side that we aren't going to agree on it at all and can't be proved one way or the other, so I'll leave that. Will say however even if you don't count centralization, nationalization or regulation as left wing, their large welfare state and mass programs certainly were. Even the corporate tax rate was tied to it and by the mid 40s was 60 percent. Taxes I actually think in themselves aren't in the spectrum but when used for quasi redistribution I think it's fair to say. \nThey nationalized Catholic schools largely due to their opposition to Catholicism and their competition with the HY. As for saying they privatized a lot more, I am not sure. There hasn't been a case study done on this yet. 500 companies nationalized is a lot after all. These weren't J companies btw they were domestic and foreign ones mainly relating to the iron and steel industries. Forgot to note about privatization, many companies sold off were sold off to NSDAP organization, thus in effect still remaining in the control of the state, if in name having a quasi private owner.   \nNot much to say on the regulation part. It's a restating of points so I'll leave that be.\nH did have an economic ideology and evidence shows the economy while not of primary importance certainly was of a large tertiary importance behind war and race. It was inherently tied to the very important idea of Labensraum. The idea came from an economist after all. H has several quotes where he says the NSDAP does have an economic ideology, and even quotes the program saying so. What he says it is in 1927, is exactly how the economy worked form 33 to 45. Zeitelmann has numerous examples on this. Strasser was a member of the party but Otto was expelled by 30 and was never very influential in his economic ideology. Gregor, much more in line with H, even supported the expulsion though he met his maker in 34. The economic ideas of the NSDAP were a rough outline when compared to other parties, but an outline nonetheless. I highly recommend Zeitelmanns book btw. He maybe right wing now, but by his own admission in the revised book he was left wing when he wrote it. I also recommend Gellately and Aly. You can of course balance it with Tooze's response to Aly. I highly recommend Evans book on historiography. It even mentions the debate. \nSocial corporatism is a non coercive non fascist version of corporatism that pre dates fascism. China is definitely the closest example of a fascist economy, followed closely by Russia.",

That's actually more restrictive than what the NSDAP did. \nAnyways, time for comparisons\nBoth use large Keynesian infrastructure programs as a way to boost economy as well as large amounts of military spending. \nBoth have the capitalist subservient to the state, with dire consequences if broken. \nBoth have tons of corruption and effectively run as a Vampire Economy (really good book btw even if it is a primary source)\nBoth have a massive focus on industry\nBoth have a large state owned trade union that is either the only real trade union or the largest one by far that oppresses non state trade unions. \nBoth have large welfare programs though here AFAIK the NSDAP was more generous than the CCP (probably a population density issue) \nBoth have their largest companies be state owned or operated while still allowing quasi private competition\nBoth engage in cartelization iirc. \nI could go on but you get the point.",

        "text": "@dr.chadguevara6214 \nNever said more left wing. Quote where I said that. Economically sure but I stated NSDAP was overall far right. The far right constantly borrow from the social democratic left especially in economics. \nI said in terms of how the economy worked. It was in between Roosevelt's Keynesian market economy America and Stalin's planned economy USSR. Read. \nSocialism can be state or worker control. Ever heard of state Socialism? Also clearly you didn't read because I said NSDAP wasn't  socialist. They weren't capitalist either. I precisely said they were corporatist, third positionist. Capitalism is private ownership of the means of production and their operation for profit. Socialism is public ownership of the means of production. The NSDAP represented a third position to this as did Italy. The means of production were privately owned, but controlled by the state and the profit motive subordinated in favor of the state's interests. This was evident by the time of the four year plan which, according to Richard Evans, heavily cut into the profits of many companies when they began to chafe under demands, subordination of the operation of the means of production for profit for the goals of the state, in this case being gearing for war and establishing totalitarian rule. Italy had the second highest rate of state owned industry by the 1930s.\nThe NSDAP wasn't very supportive of free enterprise. They only did such if it was seen as beneficial. If your private company was seen as being more efficient if it was ran by the state, then it would be nationalized or your entire board kicked out for more favorable NSDAP friendly people or disadvantaged by the state who would give the contract to your competitor as punishment. See Junkers, Thyssen, 500 companies nationalized by Gor, and many other examples I listed. In a totalitarian state, both private and public property are instruments for the state to use. You can own a private business, but more or less it is controlled by the state, as Germa Bel noted in against the mainstream. H also became an admirer of USSR's planned economy according to Rainer Zeitelmann which he demonstrates in his book. Had NSDAP won the war, likely they would have emulated it given the chance. \nThe left and right are wrong on this. Hearing both of these sides discuss this is like hearing Peterson discuss Marxism. The second hand cringe is palpable. There's a reason academia doesn't take Eco or Parenti's works on this subject seriously.",

        "text": "In the months after Hitler took power, SA and Gestapo agents went from door to door looking for Hitler’s enemies. They arrested Socialists, Communists, trade union leaders, and others who had spoken out against the Nazi party; some were murdered. By the summer of 1933, the Nazi party was the only legal political party in Germany. Nearly all organized opposition to the regime had been eliminated. Democracy was dead in Germany.\nHowever, the assumption that because the word “socialist” appeared in the party’s name and socialist words and ideas popped up in the writings and speeches of top Nazis then the Nazis must have been actual socialists is naive and ahistorical. What the evidence shows, on the contrary, is that Nazi Party leaders paid mere lip service to socialist ideals on the way to achieving their one true goal: raw, right-wing totalitarian power.\n\nYes, the Nazis were indisputably Right-Wing\n\nSometimes the claim is bandied about that the Nazis were a left-wing party on economic questions, perhaps because the Nazis were called “National socialists”. This is flatly and completely wrong and a form of pseudo-historiography. Here’s why:\n\nThe Nazi party was built on right-wing voters and a right-wing support base:\n\nThere are many disputes about the nature of Hitler’s voting base. What isn’t under dispute though is that prior to voting Nazi, Nazi voters voted for centre-right and far-right parties, or didn’t vote at all. Support for the Nazis did not come from disaffected left-wing or centre-left voters, but from right-wing voters frustrated with the existing parties of the right.\n\nIn my view this point alone is decisive. The meaning of right-wing and left-wing is not an ahistorical abstraction, it’s created by the behaviour of people and institutions. The right-wing citizens of Germany implicitly recognised the Nazis as right-wing by voting for them, case closed.\n\nRead more about which parties Nazi voters defected from here: https://gking.harvard.edu/files/gking/files/nazivp.pdf\n\n2. The Nazis literally invented privatisation:\n\nThe Nazis were responsible for huge privatisation programs. The extent of their privatisations was enormous, but it was particularly vast when compared with other countries at the time, who were generally moving in the opposite direction. The privatisations of Nazi Germany may indeed have been the first mass privatisations of public property in history and included “Steel, mining, banking, shipyard, ship-lines, and railways.” More on how Nazis bucked historical trends by privatising when no one else was here: http://www.ub.edu/graap/nazi.pdf\n\n3. Nazi policies greatly increased income inequality:\n\nIncome inequality spiked under Hitler, as was observed even at the time. More here: http://piketty.pse.ens.fr/files/capitalisback/CountryData/Germany/Other/Pre1950Series/RefsHistoricalGermanAccounts/Sweezy39.pdf\n\n4. Capital as a share of factor income also spiked under Hitler, at the expense of wages:\n\nFactor income describes the division between the factors of production, with land receiving rent, capital receiving profit and labour receiving wages. The capital share, or profit as a proportion of total income, increased by about 50% in Nazi Germany and was much higher than the US’s capital share at the time. See the below graph from Capital in the Twenty-First Century reproduced in a Jacobin article by Corey Robin:\nI’m sorry if there’s not much in the way of Belles-lettres here. If I am blunt it is for a purpose. The Nazis were right-wing. Anyone who tells you otherwise is wrong, much in the same way it is wrong to say that the world is flat, six-thousand years old, or made of cheese.",

An ad Hominem attack is a fallacy of relevance meaning that it would only be an ad Hominem if the attack upon the sources character is not a relevant reason as to why they're wrong. Saying someone is a liar as a reason not to trust their word is an attack upon the individuals character but it whether or not someone is truthful is very relevant to whether or not they should be trusted. Likewise arguing that someone should not be trusted because they help make videos for a YouTube channel that generally speaking does not produce trustworthy information in it's videos is very relevant to whether or not they can be trusted as a source of trustworthy information\nSecondly even if it was a fallacy arguing that because the argument is illogical it's claims must be untruthful is in and of itself a fallacy of relevance. Because the logicality of an argument tells us nothing of the truthfulness of it's claims. The only time one tells us the other is when an argument has true premises and false conclusions. Such an argument is inherently illogical. Specifically it is the formal fallacy of \"Drawing a Negative Conclusion from Affirmative Premises\" ... Yes that is literally the name of the fallacy. \nFinally PragerU is objectively propaganda. Everything it says is either a misrepresentation of the facts or simply an ought right lie to support the ideological beliefs of it's founder. It does not even attempt to hdie the fact that it is a partisan organization led by a hyper partisan bastard who thinks anyone to the left of McCarthy needs to be destroyed.",

Sometimes it was entertaining capitalism, sometimes it was nationalization. To frame then as having any real ideological economics stance is sort of unfair because their entire ideology was racial and economics was just a means to an end. To frame them as \"anti capitalist\" is like, sure, but only because every now and again the capitalists got in their way. If they were \"Pure Aryan\" and were party members, \"Cool!\" They were only concerned with achieving lebensraum.\n\nOne could argue the end goal of Nazism was complete nationalization of industry, but I'd argue they seriously didn't really think that shit through well enough to have a post-lebensraum society. I might have a blind spot in my knowledge tho.\n\nIndeed, sometimes they would call Jewish people Capitalists, sometimes Communists. Nazis don't give a shit about hypocrisy.",

If you look at left and right as separate to authoritarianism vs liberalism, you get a more accurate picture of philosophical ideology. Anarchism is the extreme end of liberalising policy, but can be both right and left wing- anarchosocialism and anarchocapitalism respectively. Neither of these are supposed to have rulers. Anarchism as a term is generally more associated with the left today, with anarchocapitalists usually identifying as libertarian instead.\n\nHowever, not all right wing thought is liberal and anarchistic. Absolute monarchists are right wing, and fall onto the authoritarian end of the spectrum.\n\nThe use of a phrase several thousand years ago isn't terribly relevant to how the phrases have been used over recent centuries, language evolves to suit the needs of those using it.",

Point 13 in that program demands the nationalization of all public companies, in other words socialization, or what is known here as socialism. … the good of the community takes priority over that of the individual. But the State should retain control; every owner should feel himself to be an agent of the State; it is his duty not to misuse his possessions to the detriment of the State or the interests of his fellow countrymen. That is the overriding point. The Third Reich will always retain the right to control property owners. If you say that the bourgeoisie is tearing its hair over the question of private property, that does not affect me in the least. Does the bourgeoisie expect some consideration from me? Today’s bourgeoisie is rotten to the core; it has no ideals anymore; all it wants to do is earn money and so it does me what damage it can. The bourgeois press does me damage too and would like to consign me and my movement to the devil.” – May 4, 1931, interview with Richard Breiting",

And this struggle for existence will spur these nations on to the most tremendous accomplishments in world history. If profit is the driving force for production in the democracies—a profit that industrialists, bankers, and corrupt politicians pocket—then the driving force in National Socialist Germany and Fascist Italy is the realization by millions of laborers that, in this war, it is they who are being fought against. They realize that the democracies, if they should ever win, would rage with the full capitalist cruelty, that cruelty of which only those are capable whose only god is gold, who know no human sentiments other than their obsession with profit, and who are ready to sacrifice all noble thought to this profit instinct without hesitation. This struggle is not an attack on the rights of other nations, but on the arrogance and avarice of a narrow capitalist upper class, one which refuses to acknowledge that the days are over when gold ruled the world, and that, by contrast, a future is dawning when the people will be the determining force in the life of a nation.” – January 1, 1941, speech in Berlin",

That means freedom from national control or control by the people both in the acquisition of capital and in its employment. This is really what they mean when they speak of liberty. These capitalists create their own press and then speak of the ‘freedom of the press.’ In reality, every one of the newspapers has a master, and in every case this master is the capitalist, the owner. This master, not the editor, is the one who directs the policy of the paper. If the editor tries to write other than what suits the master, he is ousted the next day.

You are defining socialism by Marx alone which is only one brand of socialism. I hate to break it to you but Marx and Engels were not the only socialists. Fascism was a brand of socialism called syndicalism which wanted big trades controlling production not necessarily workers owning the capital. National Socialism was a form of socialism that believed conflict was \"race\" driven. If you eliminated races vs. Marx's classes you would get utopia. Nazi's thought the means of production should be in German hands and free of exploitation from other tribes in their twisted view. The Jew was essentially Marx's capitalist and the Slav was inferior who couldn't provide the work in their sick ideology.

He didn't define socialism as nationalism but as collectivism and communitarianism\n\"If we are socialists, then we must oppose materialism and mammonism, how as a socialist can you not be an anti se*ite?\"\n\"From the right we take from the bourgois tradition, nationalism. From the Marxist tradition we take vital, creative socialism\" both are quotes from Hitler. It's laid out in the 25 point programme with \"Common good before the individual good\" they didn't put socialism in their name to trick workers, they truly believed themselves to be socialists. \nNorth Korea has the state controlling the entire economy, which is defined as state socialism and fits with what Marx wrote and before Marx, Babeuf, the founder of modern socialism. \nHitler himself had extreme state control over the economy albeit not disregarding private ownership entirely (though private property rights were gone by 1933). However later on late into the war he admired Stalin's planned economy and said to Speer he wished he could've nationalized all corporations and their unearned profits. \nAll quotes come from Wikiquote and are backed by sources. \nRecommended reading, Hitler's True Believers by Robert Gellately and Hitler's National Socialism by Rainer Zeitelmann",

For one, all of those industries were sold off to party members and party organizations, which were part of the state. Therefore all they did, according to the paper, wasn't liberalizing the economy, it was \"privatization to make funds while still increasing state control over the economy and private enterprise.\" In the paper its mentioned state control and regulations aided this goal. According to it \"While business did maintain some room for maneuver inside firms, due to state control, they had lost all control outside the firm and in the market.\" As Orwell put it \"Everyone was a state employee, albeit the salaries varied greatly.\" Peter Temin remarks this is very similar to Lenin's economy under the NEP. \nHitler nationalized labor unions and Catholic schools into the DAF and Hitler Youth. He nationalized privately owned unions into a state owned one. \nLenin and Stalin persecuted Menshiviks, anarchists, and the latter Trotskyists. Lenin also persecuted peasants and Krondstadt sailors. Were they not socialists? \nBig business and monarchists didnt help the NSDAP until 1933, as Richard Evans notes, and clearly it backfired. Most of the monarchists were wiped out in the Night of the Long Knives and the DNVP banned, the big businessmen became controlled by the state by the time of the four year plan. Thyssen had became disillusioned and Krupp stepped down because of it. Richard Evans talks about it. It's like you people never read a book.",

Babeuf, the founder of modern socialism, defined it as state control over the means of production. The state effectively controlled private enterprise in Nazi Germany. The right to private property was effectively abolished in 1933 and was removed from the constitution as noted by Gunter Reimann in Vampire Economy. Technically the means of production were privately owned, but could be seized by the state at any time and were tightly regulated. All companies were made into 13 corporations by the state to be easily regulated, regulations and restrictions heavily controlled, the iron, car, steel and movie industry nationalized overnight by Goring and Goebbels and the state created Volkswagen (only 19 types of cars were allowed to be produced, most of which were made by Volkswagen), Krupp and Thyssen even stepped down and became disillusioned because of it. Hitler nationalized all private trade unions into one owned by the state, just like Lenin did. Lenin and Stalin also sent socialists and anarchists to concentration camps too. The worker did indeed have no say, but neither did the capitalist. As Richard Evans put it, the worker was bossed around by foremen, his manager and DAF officials, but then so the capitalist too was bossed around by the NSDAP. No longer was the capitalists the masters of their own house. Everything was controlled by the state, as per totalitarian economics",

Maybe you should've more carefuly read all the history books you send others to read.\n\nLike your point about redistributing jewish wealth. That wasn't fueled by anything socialistic or even welfare related whatsoever, those were byproducts. It was fueled by anti-semitism (to which was linked anti-capitalism) and racism at the core of nazi ideology. Yet pretty much the same fate befell the socialists and communists since Hitler was also anti-bolshevik. While some of that wealth trickled down to the aryan race citizens, most of it went to the state in preparation for re-armament and eventual war for lebensraum. State and race were the important things to the national socialists, not the workers as would be the case for actual socialists. Hitler never saw himself as what we or Marx would call a socialist, to him it meant something else.\n\nNeither state-controlled economy is a sign of anything socialistic. Such was simply the need of the war. Even the Allied countries (temporarily) employed some form of control over key industries.\n\nNobody disputes that all totalitarian states and ideologies share many similarities. And it's not limited to just fascism, nazism and communism, there is also islamism for example. That's because the economic model plays no role in whether a state is totalitarian or not. So yes, that goes for nazism and stalinism as well, however not because of their economic systems, which might look similar, but in their cores weren't, the striking similarities only came about during the war and the neccessity for total control in order to wage a total war.\n\nWelp, everything was pretty much said at this point. Re-watch the video or read some other non-revisionist books, or don't, doesn't matter in the end.",

The Js were seen as the rulers of capitalism, as, as Hitler put it, \"a capitalistic people\" referring to the Js. As Gotz Aly shows, nationalizing J wealth and redistributing it was seen as taking the unearned and illegitimate income of the Js and giving it back to the people. This was also strengthened by Hitler forgiving all debt and restricting creditors. His anti capitalism and anti communism were both derived from anti semitism, however he didn't have much anti communism to his speeches until Rosenberg joined the party. Before that it was very much anti capitalist strictly and Hitler was a soldier who served the Bavarian Soviet Republic before he joined the DAP. He even visited the funeral of the leader wearing a red armband and was an ideological trainer within said republic. Source: Thomas Webber. Lenin also killed socialists and communists as did Stalin so that in itself doesn't mean much. Socialism predates Marx and derives from Babeuf. Furthermore Stalin is considered a socialist by most historians yet he didn't treat the workers too well especially during the war. Trade unions were banned even, subsides into one state owned trade unions, same as in Third Reich. \nThe state control over the economy in the Third Reich both pre dated the war and was far more extensive than that of the USA or UK. It wasn't comparable to them, more comparable to Lenin's NEP. Furthermore far more nationalization occurred under the fascists and Nazis than under the Americans, and it was a key tenant of their ideology, not something only war related. Italy had the second highest rate of nationalized industry second only to the USSR. It's in their 25-point program and the ideology of corporatism. There are many speeches from Hitler during the election period showing he wanted a state controlled economy. As time went on Hitler admired Stalin more and more especially after Stalin purged Liminov and admired his planned economy. He even said to Speer he wished he nationalized all corporations. Source is Zeitelmann. Had the Third Reich won, we can assume they'd of created a planned economy rather than just a command (and a very controlled command economy at that). As Richard Evans shows, while in America during and before the war businessmen were masters of their own houses, in the Third Reich this wasn't the case, from 1933 to 1945. \nThe comparisons between Stalinism and Nazism don't only coincide during the war, they go deep into ideology and the pre war period. Many Nazis themselves admitted similarities, Goebbels even comparing Hitler to Lenin. Economics do play a role in totalitarianism. Totalitarianism is government control over all aspects of life, which would include the economy. You can't have minarchist totalitarianism. \nI've seen the video, I used to agree with it. Then I read books and had my mind changed. TIK history alone has a five hour debunk of this video packed with sources. The historians I read aren't revisionist, they're mainstream. Evans, Zeitelmann, Aly and of course there's primary sources such as Reimann.",

But once again they were not fueled by socialistic principles.\n\nYes, he served in the military of the People's State of Bavaria. However not because of some socialist leaning, but simply because he had no other prospects after returning to Munich after WW1. Afaik he didn't even participate in the fighting when the German army eventually ended the rebellion, he sat it out. He detested Marxism even before WW1 in fact.\n\nYes, Lenin and Stalin killed off many socialists and bolsheviks too, however not because they were socialists or bolsheviks, but simply because they were deemed as political enemies for many reasons. This is totally not comparable with Hitler who persecuted them exactly because they were bolsheviks, since quite simply he was a madman who saw Jews behind everything.\n\nYes, the state taking ever increasing control pre-dates the war, however everything the nazis did after seizing power was in preparation first for re-armament and the subsequent war.\n\nYes, Hitler admired many aspects of Stalin's regime, but not really the man himself. He hated the bolsheviks, but he admired and desired the sheer amount of power Stalin is able to wield. And ofc the Nazis took inspiration from various aspects of the USSR regime.\n\nYes, totalitarian states are about controling ppl's lives, but a planned economy is not a pre-requisite for running a totalitarian state. Terror and prison camps are, that's how you control the people. China is a horrible dystopian totalitarian state, yet it doesn't wield a total control over the means of production... because they learned, unlike the Soviets.\n\nYou clearly read stuff, but somehow it seems you take things out and forget the context, yet context is everything in history.

Regardless that isn't near as important as the fact that all this clearly places the Nazi economy on the left, in between Roosevelt and Stalin. Nazis themselves weren't leftist but their economics were. This right wing socialism was very popular in many countries taken over by fascists. \nHe was chosen as the ideological leader for training individuals the basics of Marxism. Why would he agree to this and why did they choose him if he was anti Marxist? He could've joined the Freikorps like most other Nazis did, yet he stayed until it became apparent they wouldn't last long. Furthermore why did he attend the funeral of the leader wearing a red armband? Why was anti communism not really apparent in his speeches until Rosenberg joined the party? Give me a quote before WWI from Hitler demonstrating anti-Marxism. Hitler even attended SPD speeches in 1918, the SPD being Marxist before the 50s, albeit derived from Bernstein's brand of Marxism. He even once said \"We were all social democrats once\" clearly he didn't have his ideology solidified until 1919, and even then it changed heavily during WWII. \nStalin and Lenin did persecute them for exactly the reason I said, because they were socialists they hated. Menshivik socialism is quite different from Marxist-Leninism as is anarchism. Ideologically they were at odds. Stalin hated Trotsky and both heavily disagreed on matters such as internationalism, ironically the main point of contention between Nazism and Stalinism. \nIndeed it was motivated by rearmament, but also by totalitarianism in general as laid out by the 25 point program, which Hitler reiterated in an interview in 1931. Had the Nazis won, they weren't gonna lessen restrictions. If anything seeing his ideological shift during the war, he'd of nationalized many companies as was demonstrated in Zeitelmann's book.\nHitler admired Stalin himself. It was respect for an enemy. He was quoted as saying Stalin had ended J Bolshevism and turned Russia into Russian National Socialism. This is even in a great movie, Downfall, where Hitler wishes he executed his generals like Stalin did. Hitler didn't see Stalin as a Bolshevik you see, not privately. It was proven to him when Stalin purged Liminov. Furthermore a book titled \"Fascism: Career of an Idea 1914 to 1945\" shows how the USSR borrowed terror tactics from Fascist Italy. \nI'm glad you mention China because they're the best comparison to the Nazi economy. However while not a planned economy, they're definitely a command economy. There's a reason tankies like them. Vikki1999 on YouTube has a video explaining Chinese economics. They're pretty tankie though despite their anarchism. It's bizarre. \nSo give me the context. I'm taking directly from these books, not removed of context. Sorry I can't quote the whole damn page but still. Hitler could be considered right wing socially and left wing economically. Hayek considered him right wing socialism while Reimann considered his economics to be leftist capitalism. Take that for what you will.",

Yes, I heard USSR and Eastern Bloc countries also being described as such, but their capitalistic enterprises were far more limitted, many of them nationalized or publically owned, than those of Nazi Germany or modern China.",

        "text": "@Jefffrrry \n @Jeffry Jefferson  \nSocialism is derived from Babeuf. In his philosophy we can find what socialism means. According to Rothbard: \"In the ideal communist society sought by the Conspiracy, private property would be abolished, and all property would be communal and stored in communal storehouses. From these storehouses, the goods would be distributed “equitably” by the superiors—apparently, there was to be a cadre of “superiors” in this oh so “equal” world!\" Most scholars define socialism as public ownership of the means of production. Public can mean worker or state. There's state socialism, syndicalism and guild socialism for example. The philosophy of Italian Fascism didn't differ much from the last one. For the NSDAP, the means of production were privately owned, but only nominally. Property could be seized by the state at any time, all companies were forcibly cartelized into 13 corporations and regulations and restrictions were strict. In effect, this was de facto state control over the means of production. Perhaps not ownership, but definitely control. Capitalism is the private ownership of the means of production and their operation for profit. While technically the means of production was privately owned in Nazi Germany, the profit motive was eliminated, focused entirely on rearmament no matter if it reduced profits or even hurt them. Perhaps then the Nazi system lays in between this. Between socialism and capitalism. Perhaps corporatism best describes it, an inherently collectivist economic philosophy with roots in syndicalism. \nThe Nazis didn't detest socialism. They wouldn't have considered themselves socialists if they did. Class revolution isn't always a feature of socialism. There are many non revolutionary forms of socialism. Revolution was mainly from Marx and Babeuf. Many socialists during that time were utopians who didn't want struggle. Hitler himself considered himself a revolutionary, and Zeitelmann and I agree. He represents a form of right wing revolution that overthrew the Weimar Republic. Hitler replaced class warfare with r*cial warfare, borrowing from Marx. Instead of all history being class struggle, it was racial struggle. This is almost like a racial Marxism if you will. Instead of everything being viewed with class lenses, it was race lenses, but the logic and points remained the same. Hitler even said this in MK, saying \"Without race, we would simply be competing with Marxism on their own ground\" \nThe idea of peoples community was the idea that all class barriers (not classes themselves, but barriers) would be removed and it would be a total meritocracy. This is read in the 25 point program as common law replaces Roman law. The Nazis even made all Germans legally the same, removing aristocratic and capitalist legal protections. Obviously this didn't extend to people they were racist towards. But within, with welfare and changes in law, people could move up without barriers and overall society would be equal in a way. The gap between rich and poor lessened considerably. This was prevalent in the military, where the lowest worker could rise up to become a general, free of old aristocratic military tradition. Hitler himself was homeless at one point. Not defending the Nazis btw, just showing their ideology.\nPlanned economy is different from command. China and Third Reich are command, USSR was planned. State capitalism doesn't mean if firms are private or public, only of the state operates the economy is a market way",

        "text": "@ManiacMayhem7256 And I agree with the underlying points, again your basis is solid, built on solid ground. Just you take all these points and yet somehow connect them very differently.\n\nYou can go further in socialism examples than that even, but let's just stop at seizing the means of production out of private hands.\n\nThe companies were still operated for profit tho, their profit was however used for the state. But don't forget that Nazis initially privatized a lot of companies that Weimar republic took direct control of, ofc putting them in loyal nazi capitalists' hands.\n\nYou can detest something btw, yet utilize aspects of it for your benefit. Especially if you can sell it easily to the public. But, using the example of socialism, if you remove the core tennets of it, without which socialism isn't socialism anymore, you can't really be a socialist. You could still think you are one, but you would more accurately be described by one of the thousands of labels related to and stemming from socialism. For easy example take Bernie Sanders, many wrongly call him socialist, he described himself as democratic socialist, yet in reality his proposed policies more closely resemble social democratic ones. What seems like small nuances are actually huge differencies. Did Hitler employ socialistic policies? Yes, absolutely. But the most important aspect of socialism is missing here and was never even attempted by the Nazis.\n\nI mean, if we count USSR as a form of state capitalism, with 5 year plans, whole industries nationalized and state owned, running a market with next to no competition, closed off, heavily regulated, warped and artificially ran... then Nazi Germany and China fall under it too and actually fulfill the name and definition more faithfully.\n\nAs was pointed by others above, Fascism and Nazism don't really operate on the capitalist vs. socialist division, their goal was to end both systems, which they saw as having developed in the wrong direction, and replace it with their third way. Nazism then added onto it in-built aryan superiority and anti-semitism, in a nutshell. Logically they would use policies employed by both and end up at a point between them, and logically one side's policies would be employed more. That's given by default. And you will be described by one of the derived labels. But unless you go all the way, and actually seize the means of productions, your system is not in reality socialism, no matter how you yourself name it. Just like the Great October Socialist Revolution wasn't really great, didn't really happen in october (yeah, yeah, different calendar) and wasn't very socialist. Naming something one way doesn't simply make it so.\n\nI really don't know how to describe it in another words anymore. These are thus my closing words. Hitler was not a socialist, because he simply didn't employ and didn't even want to employ socialism. Nazi Germany didn't operate under the single most important principle of socialism (and missing the other most important principle of Marx's socialism alltogether), despite borrowing from socialism a lot.\n\nI will read and acknowledge your reply, but I don't think the debate will continue past that, since so far it seems our conclusions are not much reconcilable.",

        "text": "@Jefffrrry \n @Jeffry Jefferson  \nThe companies weren't really operated for profit by the time Goring and Funk replaced Schacht. I wish we were on twitter so I could show pics from my source instead of copying and pasting which would almost certainly get my comment ghost banned. YouTube never left 2005 comment wise apparently. Just with more censorship. Anyways, to shorten, effectively the four year plan was profitable to many companies short term, but long term ran counter to their profits and ability to produce. Large fines, taxes, regulations and such also hurt this. The NSDAP still demanded more, sort of ending the profit motive. Did companies still try to seek profit? Ofc, but they did that too under the NEP. However it ran in counter to the state's demands. Furstrated, the NSDAP out flanked private industry with Volkswagen and Goring steel works and such. \nNot just loyal capitalists, who were party members (reminds me of CCP), but also most were sold off to NSDAP organizations, who were part of the state. It was, according to Germa Bel's paper, privatization with the goal of strengthening state control. The only reason they privatized to begin with is to increase funds for themselves. In anywhere from page 14 to 17 on that paper, he shows that increasing state control made up for nationalization, which definitely occurred massively under Goring, and that while businesses maintained some room for maneuver within firms, they practically lost all control in the market.\nHitler didn't detest socialism, least not how he defined it. We can see in his private convos with Otto Wagener and his second book he definitely considered himself a socialist in private. The way he defined socialism seemed to be somewhat economic but mostly based on collectivism and communitarianism. Common good before the individual good. He was once quoted in an interview as saying National Socialism takes from the bourgeois tradition, nationalism. From Marxism, vital creative socialism. The Bernie Sanders comparison works. \nTo finish off, let me get past the main topic. I kinda don't care if Hitler was a socialist or not. I'm mainly countering other stuff with this topic, even if it's the main. It's a good dropping off point. However you're right about third positionism. Corporatism, which is what I said in my comment. I think then perhaps fascism and National Socialism are best defined not as post-Marxist socialism, but post-socialist Marxism. Basically the leaders abandoned their socialist past and class warfare ideology but still clinged onto anti capitalism and reworked the world into a framework very similar to Marx if you swapped class for race or nation each time. I've always called fascism the bastard brother of Marxism, right wing Leninism if you will. Like I said, instead of all history being class struggle, its racial struggle, and vice versa. Hitler, if we can trust the Rauschning convos which are dubious, says he learned a great deal from Marxism. Not from their class warfare ideology, but from it's tactics and way of viewing the world and such, that the whole of National Socialism was based on it. He detested Marxism, but in turn he heavily borrowed from it",

This video doesn't accurately represent anything lmao. People who want to endorse socialism are at heart all just anti-capitalists, like both Hitler and Marx. They believe poverty exists because individuals can't be responsible with personal wealth, so the government must mediate all commerce.  Enlightenment Liberalism puts individual soveirgnty as its first principle. Capitalism is the right to own private property, which at its most basic unit is the value of your own labor. This video tries to claim Hitler wasn't a socialist because he sent authobahn workers who tried to advocate for wages to concentration camps... this is because advocating for YOUR WAGES is advocating for individual wealth - why are you not happy as a productive member of the collective, are you claiming all of your needs aren't cared for by the state? off to the concentration camp with you!!  Pretending people had private property in Germany is laughable because German citizens themselves had no soveirgnty, they didn't even own the value of their own labor - they were forced to submit to the will of the Nation Socialist party or be murdered. These socialist arguments are clinging to technicalities while skirting the meat of the matter which is regardless of whether you call it left wing or right wing, national or international, democratic or liberal, individuals do not self organize based on the whims of the state, the self organize based on their own immediate needs. So no matter what collectivist societies always result in authoritarianism otherwise all of their policies are utterly unenforceable.",

The abolition of ground rents, and the prohibition of all speculation in land. \n18 We demand that ruthless war be waged against those who work to the injury of the common welfare. Traitors, usurers, profiteers, etc., are to be punished with death, regardless of creed or race. \n19 We demand that Roman law, which serves a materialist ordering of the world, be replaced by German common law. \n25 In order to carry out this program we demand: the creation of a strong central authority in the State, the unconditional authority by the political central parliament of the whole State and all its organizations. \nThe formation of professional committees and of committees representing the several estates of the realm, to ensure that the laws promulgated by the central authority shall be carried out by the federal states. \nThe leaders of the party undertake to promote the execution of the foregoing points at all costs, if necessary at the sacrifice of their own lives.",

He is for the only freedom that can be a serious fact, namely for the freedom of the state and the freedom of the individual in the state. And this is because for the fascist everything in the state and Nothing is human or spiritual and does not even have value outside the state. In this sense, fascism is totalitarian and the fascist state, as a synthesis and unity of all values, interprets and develops the entire people's life, and also enhances its rhythm\".\n\nSigns of totalitarianism for Mussolini:\n\n- State management is strictly from the top down, from the leader to the smallest cogs.\n\n- The definition of the state of a person's place in society and its tasks.\n\n- Denial of classes, social groups and any other forms of an association of citizens. There is only a state and an individual.\n\n- Everyone is valued exactly as much as he fully corresponds to his place in the state machinery.\n\n- Identification and control by the state of absolutely all aspects of the individual's life (for example, the citizens' selection programs in the Reich).\n\nThese signs are important, but in general they are not limited to totalitarianism. This is a whole ideology.\n\nBut after the war, Zbigniew Brzezinski came up with his definition of totalitarianism:\n\n- The only mass party headed by a charismatic leader and absorbing a relatively small part of the population (up to 10%), whose core is unshakably committed to ideology. The party is organized according to the oligarchic principle and, as a rule, either stands above the bureaucratic state organization, or is completely intertwined with it;\n\n- An official ideology covering all vital aspects of human existence and which should be recognized by all;\n\n- Centralized system of control and management of the economy.\n\n- Monopoly on the media;\n\n- Monopoly on all means of armed struggle;\n\n- A system of terrorist police control directed not only against the \"enemies\" of the regime, but also against arbitrarily chosen groups and classes of the population;\n\nThis, in contrast to the concept of Mussolini - just a set of signs. Moreover, Brzezinski himself set them up according to the principle of the greatest conformity to their American notions of the USSR.\n\nThe option of Brzezinski will not be considered, for this is just his invention for equating the USSR to fascism.\n\nA version of Mussolini for the USSR of the times of Stalin is not suitable, because the role of councils and collectivism was great at this time. And the state was considered only as a temporary higher form of the collective (until the victory of the world revolution).",

        "text": "\"Of course the Soviet Union had finance capital\" - financial capital is banking + industrial. The purpose of capital is to increase it, and Soviet money is used as a means of exchange for goods. Thus, the Soviet economy does not use money as a means to create capital until 1965 when the Kosygin reforms were used.\n\n\"When the decision was made in Moscow to open a copper mine in Mongolia, they obviously used finance capital to do so\" - This is true only within the framework of the capitalist system. In the USSR there was socialism and therefore, to begin any major project, you did not need money. The main thing is to have resources and workers. The more goods will be produced - the more money they will be provided. \n\n\"Soviet Union didn't have chauvinism? Explain the Great Patriotic War and its Great Russian slant\" - What does the great Russian bias mean? According to statistics, ethnic Russian soldiers made up about 65% of the total number of Soviet soldiers. The rest were other nationalities. Yes, Soviet officers preferred to use Slavs at the front instead of others, but this is not connected with chauvinism policy, but with military pragmatism - Slavs had better motivation to fight and better education. For example, the peoples of the Caucasus had problems with motivation (therefore, some of them were later deported for cooperation with the Nazis), and people from Central Asia had a poor level of education and some of them did not even know Russian. Thus it is impossible to use such people in the Soviet army. \n\n\"Or the ethnic cleansing of the Western Muslims from 1944 to the Khrushchev era\" - what does mean? Crimean Tatars and Chechens? They were deported for collaboration with the Nazis in large quantities. Some nationalities (for example, the Volga Germans and Koreans in the Far East) were preventively deported. \n\n\"As for Dimitrov, do some research on the looting of capital and industry of Bulgaria by the Soviet Union\" - I don't know, maybe it was part of the war reparations. Bulgaria has traditionally been an agrarian state and did not have a strong industry. \n\n\"Enver Hoxha later on termed it Soviet social-imperialism\" - imperialism means that the USSR creates privileges for itself. Can you name some?\n\n\"National Socialism and the Marxist regimes should be called fascist if we actually mean totalitarian\" - as I showed in the previous report, the term totalitarianism was interpreted after the war to unite the USSR and Germany as a common enemy for the West. What is important for us is that the Soviet government did not consider itself fascist, and the Nazis denied Marxism and the class struggle.\n\n\"I think the annihilation of liberal democracy, civil society, checks and balances, unlimited terror from the police and unitary dictatorship apply to all those regimes, with varying degrees\" - if you have a red apple and a tomato, then you see that they are both red, both are round and both can be eaten. But this does not mean that they are the same. To check this you need to look at the foundation of this phenomenon. \n\n\"Soviet's under Lenin and Trotsky and the Chekists was the worst regime ever\" - It is documented that during Lenin, Soviet democracy was not destroyed. For example, in January 1918, Lenin wanted to make peace with Germany immediately, but the Soviet government did not support him in the framework of a vote - it supported Trotsky’s point of view \"neither peace nor war\" and therefore the war was continued. \n\n\"Satanic hell\" - demonization is part of propaganda.",

The main thing is to have resources and workers. The more goods will be produced - the more money they will be provided. \r\"\n\nTake a casual look at any of Stalin's Five Year Plans and you will see money being referenced in all kinds of investments. The Soviets had a central bank, Gosbank, and many regional banks for the party managerial elite to use. Moreover, the first Stalin Show Trial in 1931 was specifically about bankers allegedly using money and capital in an illegal way. The Soviets never abolished money. Finance capital was controlled by the Party unlike free individuals as in a capitalist country. I understand your anti-revisionist narrative via-a-vis the Soviet Union, but I'm afraid you are wrong.\n\n\"What does the great Russian bias mean?\"\n\nIt means in the way you are actually defending it here, that, simply put, there were alleged patriotic races in the Soviet Union like the Russians, and alleged non-patriotic races like the Western Muslims, whom were ethnically cleansed due to Stalin's appliance of collective guilt, something you are defending. Everyone now understands Stalin, to save his skin, had to resort to Russian patriotism rather than Soviet internationalism because the Soviets were thoroughly overran by the Germans. Moreover, Stalin ethnically cleansed multiple races like the Chechens, Germans, to some extent the Poles in collaboration with the Nazis etc to further cement that he became a Russian nationalist, so much so many White emigres became Stalinist/National Communists.\n\n\"I don't know, maybe it was part of the war reparations. Bulgaria has traditionally been an agrarian state and did not have a strong industry\"\n\nProbably, and it was somewhat typical of an executive at behest of a victorious nation, not a Marxist internationalist, further showing Stalin had become an aggressive Russian nationalist.\n\n\"imperialism means that the USSR creates privileges for itself. Can you name some?\"\n\nPolitically: using Comintern to direct and overrule other Communist parties, eg forcing the French Communist Party to become Nazi collaborators before Operation Barbarossa. Also refer to the Tito-Stalin split.\nMilitarily: the right of the Soviets to invade countries to \"liberate workers\" due to it being a supposed workers' state, starting from Lenin's invasion of Poland with the goal of the Ruhr in Germany. \nTrade: Soviet investment in copper in Mongolia, for instance, where the Soviets were joint owners in copper mines which resulted in the Soviets being able to buy copper below market values. Same is true for Cuba and sugar. Also refer to the Soviet-Albania split.\n\n\"It is documented that during Lenin, Soviet democracy was not destroyed. For example, in January 1918, Lenin wanted to make peace with Germany immediately, but the Soviet government did not support him in the framework of a vote - it supported Trotsky’s point of view \"neither peace nor war\" and therefore the war was continued. \"\n\nThere was no such thing as \"Soviet democracy\" after the Bolshevik coup, financed by the German military and Wall Street. The Kerensky government, which was both liberal and socialist, was the legitimate government. Moreover, by arresting the Mensheviks and Social-Revolutionary parties clearly destroyed any pretense of a \"Soviet\" government, considering they dominated the Soviets. You're actually referring to a 16 member Politburo decision vis-a-vis Lenin, hardly representing the vast Russian empire. The Bolsheviks never commanded a majority of support from either the workers or peasants, only temporarily gaining some support on a single issue, ending the war. The Bolsheviks not only destroyed the legal, and democratic, government of Russia ran by Kerensky, but also the actual \"Soviets\".",

I said that the USSR had problems with the loyalty of Chechens and Crimean Tatars. This does not mean that other nationalities were non-patriotic. Deportation also does not mean ethnic cleansing, although repression against the Poles was close to this definition.\n\n3. A new concept of Soviet patriotism (a shift in emphasis from traditional internationalism) was created in 1934, not during the war. She largely responded to the threat of Nazism.\n\n4. If you had in mind the cooperation of the NKVD and the Gestapo, then this is a fake that was created by the Russian journalist German Nazarov in the 1990s in one of the anti-Semitic newspapers. Otherwise, you must provide any data on ideological cooperation between the USSR and Germany.\n\n5. Cite any Soviet document that has the goal of increasing the popularity of Russian nationalism in the USSR to the detriment of other nations. I know that this is 100% wrong, and the repressions against the Poles were aimed at reducing the danger to the USSR on the western border, from which the main military threat came for him.\n\n6. Cite the order of the Soviet Communists who tell the French to become Nazi collaborators (WTF).\n\n7. The USSR invaded countries that were in the Soviet zone of influence according to a secret protocol. That is, it was the recovery of the old territories of the Russian empire (not politics) and the elimination of the buffer anti-Soviet cordon. It has nothing to do with chauvinism or privilege, just political pragmatism.\n\n8. Soviet-Polish war began at the initiative of Poland (the attack to the east). Initially, Lenin supported the independence of this state.\n\n9. The October Revolution in Russia was due to an alliance between the Bolsheviks, the Mensheviks and the Social Revolutionaries (coalition).\n\nInformation about foreign financing of the Bolsheviks is 100% fake. Today it is part of conspiracy theories.\n\nThe Kerensky government lost its support among the people for half a year in 1917 and as a result almost no one defended it.\n\nThe left SRs and anarchists fought on the side of the Bolsheviks until the end of the civil war.\n\nIf you think that it is possible to win a civil war in a peasant country (Russia) without having any support from these people, then you are greatly mistaken.\n\n10. For the rest, you use the usual demonizing where the Bolsheviks are always the devil who oppresses his own and other nations for no reason. Try to name the positive achievements of these people so that I can see the level of your objectivity.",

There are more regulations placed on Business in the US then several \"Socialist\" Governments in the world.\n\nAnd when the US Government is bailing out Corporations which they deem \"too big to fail\" (a phrase that completely contradicts Capitalism) with taxpayer's money that is not \"external\" to the markets; that is the Government blatantly manipulating the markets, picking winners and losers. After General Motors (one of the largest Corps. in AmeriKa) was bailed out after it's '08 bankruptcy the Government owned 61% of its stock. Do you believe that is \"Capitalism\" or \"external\" to the markets?\n\nI'm not arguing for or against Socialism nor Capitalism because I believe both have good qualities and can complement each other if balanced right, as with everything in life. This isn't the case in AmeriKa however, where Corporations and Banks, todays Robber Barrons, have used their power and influence to lobby (bribe) Government to get a unfair advantages in the markets. In this sense AmeriKa isn't Socialist nor Capitalist; it would better be defined as a _Corporatocracy_\n\n\"Competition is a sin!\" — \"Capitalist\" John D. Rockefeller.",

        "text": "MajorLeague excuse you, where does Marx EVER say that one should prop themselves up on slave labor, or murder political dissonance, or even that the rich should be manhandled into working? Jfc: for a black person, I'd assumed you'd learned the difference between mutable and immutable qualities someone has. Folks like MLK would be a little appalled by your suggestions that the classes instigated by capitalism and the poor rising against them, are at all comparable to the injustice folks like ourselves face for the color of our skin, good lord. I'd expected better, honestly  (I'm black myself, before you even attempt to pull that shit with me). So let's actually get into it, because you seem to have such a large misunderstanding of how capitalism and marxism work Mr. \"I'll only use the broadest definition in the dictionary to define what I mean\". \n\nSo onto capitalism first: capitalism is defined as an economic system designed to make as much money(capital) as one can, in as short a time as possible. Typically unregulated, as that tends to slow the money train down. Now, one criticism that I, Marx, and the great MLK had, is that in order for capitalism to succeed, the workers have to be payed less than their work is worth. If I make a sneaker worth 4 bucks, I'm paid a fourth of that. He suggested the best way to counter this, would be for the workers to own the means of production (instead of the state, you jackass. I don't even know how a fucking libertarian such as yourself would confuse the two, unless you're trying to be obstinate ) so that they get to decide how much to sell their work for. \n\nMarx's point about the bourgeoisie, is not an arbitrary point at all, I don't know how the hell you miss it. This isn't even assuming you agree, fucking who cares, but the way Marx defined it, is as the ones who stand to benefit the most from this system, and actively undermine their workers, to get the most money. The way he saw it, doing things like going against regulations at all cost, including ones designed to protect the worker, such as safety laws, was unjust, and would eventually cause a revolt among the common man, who would: depending on who you ask, either an anarchist, or a democratic socialist; would seize the means of production either using the law, or by force, and then own the means of production directly.\n\nNow, here's where we get into why you're being a jackass, by conflating the two: there is no means of production controlled by the jews, or blacks in Germany. Now, assets, sure, but those aren't stolen and redistributed amongst the people even. They're instead seized by the state, to do whatever they wish with it. The german worker sees nothing of this. This is also forgetting the slave labor aspect. I know you mention how Marx never directly states slave labor is anti marxism, but you then neglect to mention his point that capitalism IS slavery. So you're suggesting that Marx is saying he'd like to use the rich as a surrogate for the poor, and exploit them via unfair working conditions, like slavery. Now, if you respond, and you don't directly refute that last point, really, the biggest and silliest conclusion you're suggesting by saying there's a direct parallel, I will not engage with you. No beating around the bush. Either admit that was wrong, and just go on trying to debate the problems of socialism, or fucking prove that's the end all conclusion Marx had Like, sure, fucking hate socialism if you want, but you deliberately mischaracterize it for political expediency. There's a reason that current folks who want socialism aren't suggesting creating an underclass of minorities to bolster the economy.",

But to talk about references, the only ones used are the closely examined references of Three Arrows, and the non-existant, or false references of Crowded. Arrows goes over this in the video, Crowded straight up modifies a quote from Gregov Strasser to be attributed to Adolf Hitler, which he then backs up with viable evidence. He then goes to rebuke every single point made by crowded, with actual backed up evidence rather than going off quotes that were literally never said, or was nazi propaganda, or was nothing to do with the subject at hand. \n\n\nBut nope, why use actual referencing, when you can beat down the enemy with FACTS and KNOWLEDGE! How clever of you! And now you're going to claim that my argument is a classic example of \"oh yes, ad infomercial, hm hm, *sips tea*.\" Clearly I'm not actually providing evidence, I'm just manipulating emotion to sell my point and plush toys.",

Of course in the economic axis they were more of a mixed economy. I understand that debating over labels like left-wing and right-wing is futile as well because historically these will and have changed for sure, but what I'm getting at is that Nazism does seem to bring out what we contemporarily would call right-wing, perhaps a form of right-wing socialism, would you agree?",

Socialism indeed appears in many different forms, and I believe there is not a single definition that encapsulates them all, there may be elements shared by them all, but the broad definition of socialism makes it quite easy to argue that a system was socialist, which makes it sort of useless for contemporary political commentary other than to smear people using that label. It is debatable that Nazi Germany was socialist as it is debatable that Cuba is socialist or that China is socialist, the difference between them I believe is what gives a political meaning to them. Essentially, socialism varies in scope and is not subject to the left-right dichotomy we often use, that's what i'm trying to get at. What could be of use is to judge Nazi Germany in that very dichotomy, as rudimentary as it is, to get a better idea of what it meant to be a nazi, instead of just branding it socialist and labeling it left wing as all \"socialism must be\"",

        "text": "​ MajorLeague  Right. Putting aside the personal attacks and your meandering, pretentious use of unnecessarily complicated language to express very simple concepts, let's address the very small sliver of substance in your post, which is to say the first two sentences.\n\r\nYou've defined \"adherence\" in this context as \"belief in and pursuit of its principles.\" Principles. That's another way, then, of saying that you agree that an ideology (e.g., socialism) actually means certain things, independently of someone simply claiming to be a member of said ideology. \"Identification\" you have as self-labeling. Fine.\n\nYour argument, then, would appear to be as follows:\n\nP1. A person is a member of an ideology just in case that person both believes and pursues its principles and also identifies him or her self as a member.\nP2. Hitler believed and pursued the principles of socialism.\nP3. Hitler identified himself as a socialist.\nC. Hitler was a socialist.\n\nPresumably, you would agree that one cannot be a socialist only by claiming to be one. Curiously, you would also seem to hold that one cannot be a socialist only by believing and pursuing the principles of socialism. Apparently, from what you are telling me, one must both believe and pursue its principles AND claim membership in order to qualify.\n\nDo I have it now? Before we proceed further, it is important to ensure that we're talking about the same thing ... preferably without any more needless digressions.",

        "text": "​MajorLeague Um, that isn't even what \"strawman\" means. A strawman is a deliberately bad and misrepresented argument constructed in order to attribute it to the other person and then knock it down ... like a \"straw man.\" If you're going to keep spamming logical fallacies you've Googled at people, you should at least try to learn what they actually mean.\n\nI realize, incidentally, that you do that in order to make yourself appear smarter than everyone, but it doesn't work. You exhibit a child's understanding of what an educated person sounds like, and the truth is, you come off as every bit as stupid and uneducated as you actually are. What I'm trying to tell you is that people can see through your bullshit, quite easily in fact.\n\nWhat I was honestly attempting to do was reconstruct your argument, using what YOU said, in order to discuss it with you. However, it is becoming clear that you aren't serious about discussing it and that the possibility of having your position carefully examined leaves you feeling extremely threatened.\n\nIt's useless to attempt to engage in a serious discussion with someone who isn't acting in good faith, as you clearly are not, so I won't waste any more time on you. Instead, I will simply leave a summary of what we've established for anyone who cares to know but doesn't want to have to slog through all of this again:\n\nTL;DR SUMMARY OF OUR DISCUSSION BEGINS HERE\n\nMajorLeague: My argument is that socialism is defined by adherence and identification to itself like most other philosophies.\n\nMe: What is \"adherence and identification to itself\"?\n\nMajorLeague: Adherence to a philosophy is belief in and pursuit of its principles. Identification with a philosophy is labeling and association of one's self with that philosophy.\n\nMe: Your argument, then, would appear to be as follows:\r\n\r\nP1. A person is a member of an ideology just in case that person both believes and pursues its principles and also identifies him or her self as a member.\r\nP2. Hitler believed and pursued the principles of socialism.\r\nP3. Hitler identified himself as a socialist.\r\nC. Hitler was a socialist.\n\nAt this point, MajorLeague denies that this is his argument, even though it's literally nothing more than a reconstruction of what we JUST established IS his argument ACCORDING TO HIM. He then goes on to demonstrate that he has no idea what a \"strawman\" is and that, in the face of serious discussion, his only resort is ad hominem attacks.\n\n/END SUMMARY",

MajorLeague's OWN sources conflict with his claims, as seen here:\n\nhttps://en.m.wikiquote.org/wiki/Adolf_Hitler\n\n\"'Our adopted term 'Socialist' has nothing to do with Marxian Socialism. Marxism is anti-property; true socialism is not. Marxism places no value on the individual, or individual effort, of efficiency; true Socialism values the individual and encourages him in individual efficiency, at the same time holding that his interests as an individual must be in consonance with those of the community. All great inventions, discoveries, achievements were first the product of an individual brain. It is charged against me that I am against property, that I am an atheist. Both charges are false.\"\n\n\"Socialism is the science of dealing with the common weal. Communism is not Socialism. Marxism is not Socialism. The Marxians have stolen the term and confused its meaning. I shall take Socialism away from the Socialists. Socialism is an ancient Aryan, Germanic institution. Our German ancestors held certain lands in common. They cultivated the idea of the common weal. Marxism has no right to disguise itself as socialism. Socialism, unlike Marxism, does not repudiate private property.\"\n\nDoesn't sound very against private property, does he? And indeed the Nazis were not, as the video itself discusses well enough beginning at about 18:00. Yet according to MajorLeague, the Nazis fit the Oxford definition of \"a political and economic theory of social organization which advocates that the means of production, distribution, and exchange should be owned or regulated by the community as a whole.\"\n\nOf course, I think that at this point, we can take what he says with a grain of salt. After all, he ALSO argued that \"socialism is defined by adherence and identification to itself like most other philosophies\" ... then promptly denied that that was his argument when I began to try to question him about it in detail.\n\nYeah. I think we're done here.",

Then it just becomes, \"Okay, so by that definition, the Nazis were socialist. Also, so what?\"\n\nBesides, you already ceded when you refused to accept your own argument. You gave up.

        "text": "This is for all you Socialist/ Marxist Sycophants on this thread , Hitler Was a Socialist Who Learned from Karl Marx. Let’s hear from his own words:\n\n\nHitler on Marxism\n“National Socialism derives from each of the two camps the pure idea that characterizes it, national resolution from bourgeois tradition; vital, creative socialism from the teaching of Marxism.” – \n\nJanuary 27, 1934, interview with Hanns Johst in Frankforter Volksblatt\n\nHitler on Teaching Socialism\n“There is a difference between the theoretical knowledge of socialism and the practical life of socialism. People are not born socialists, but must first be taught how to become them.” – \n\nOctober 5, 1937, speech in Berlin\n\nHitler on Capitalism\n“In those countries, it is actually capital that rules; that is, nothing more than a clique of a few hundred men who possess untold wealth and, as a consequence of the peculiar structure of their national life, are more or less independent and free. They say: ‘Here we have liberty.’ By this they mean, above all, an uncontrolled economy, and by an uncontrolled economy, the freedom not only to acquire capital but to make absolutely free use of it. That means freedom from national control or control by the people both in the acquisition of capital and in its employment. This is really what they mean when they speak of liberty. These capitalists create their own press and then speak of the ‘freedom of the press.’ In reality, every one of the newspapers has a master, and in every case this master is the capitalist, the owner. This master, not the editor, is the one who directs the policy of the paper. If the editor tries to write other than what suits the master, he is ousted the next day. This press, which is the absolutely submissive and characterless slave of the owners, molds public opinion. Yes, certainly, we jeopardize the liberty to profiteer at the expense of the community, and, if necessary, we even abolish it.” – \n\nDecember 10, 1940, speech in Berlin\n\nHitler on Socialism\n“Socialism as the final concept of duty, the ethical duty of work, not just for oneself but also for one’s fellow man’s sake, and above all the principle: Common good before own good, a struggle against all parasitism and especially against easy and unearned income. And we were aware that in this fight we can rely on no one but our own people. We are convinced that socialism in the right sense will only be possible in nations and races that are Aryan, and there in the first place we hope for our own people and are convinced that socialism is inseparable from nationalism.” – \n\nAugust 15, 1920, speech in Munich at the Hofbräuhaus.",

I googled and literally nowhere is this supposed \"Interview\" to be found. The only places this quote shows up (in English, not German!) is, guess what, when anti-intellectual dumbasses like yourself try  to \"prove\" that the Nazis were socialists. So, this seems like another one of these good old quotes that are either taken out of context, misattributed or even completely made up. Just like the \"We are Socialists!\" quote that you so often claim was said by Hitler, when it was actually said by Gregor Strasser. So, kindly go to your corner and be quiet.",

Maybe something to do with what they're taught in school? I dunno. It seems to be an almost sacred mantra to some.\n\nI have to say I don't think people are going to stop repeating the \"BUT SOCIALIST IS IN THE NAME\" gotcha anytime soon, but the dive into the history of factionalism and ideological conflict within the NSDAP is really intriguing as we hear pretty much nothing about that outside of Germany, let alone outside of Europe.",

But believe you me, they would go straight to oppressive violence if the events of 1968 were to happen again, because they chose that route once, and they will again. So long as political dissidence does not actually threaten the status quo, it is allowable. This is true for all states. The DPRK, as it is in a precarious position, views all political dissidence as a threat to their power.

If France were under *similar* situations to the DPRK, though, it would do *similar* things, namely repression of political dissidents, state control of industry, focus on agriculture and geopolitical grandstanding in order to affect change on the sanctions against it. France is different to the DPRK in ideology, but ideology means little to the state and its rulers. The conditions a state is subjected to determine its reaction.\n\n>Even if you were right that first assertion\nOh good, you're at least considering my poin-\n>which you aren't\noh alright then\n\n>it wouldn't have any bearing on wether France is less repressive than the dprk *right now*.\nLike I said, France exports its oppression. Just because one state is less oppressive than another doesn't mean that state is actually, materially, better than the other. They're both bad, because both are oppressive. That is what is important.\n\n> And what does your point about imprisoning not being just because I think it is just even mean. Yeah sure unless you accept absolute morality what you say is true but this again has no bearing on wether nearly everyone would agree that the French prison and legal system is lightyear's ahead of the north korean.\n\nIt means that you agree with France's prisons, but not with the DPRK's, because you align ideologically with France. I, on the other hand, disagree with both prison systems, because both are enacting systemic violence against their populaces in service to an unjustified hierarchy. And because I know this is going to be a sticking point for you, violence is the limiting of the autonomy of an individual, and there can indeed be justified violence, but it does have to justify itself. Both France and the DPRK do exert justified violence on, for instance, rapists, but this is in service to greater unjustified hierarchies, and so a whole hell of a lot of unjust violence occurs in both states.\n\n I do not need to list what unjust violence the DPRK performs, since we've all heard the defector accounts, but France has the same problems as every single capitalist country: there are more empty homes than homeless people, and yet squatting is illegal. Homelessness is also punished, where public spaces which homeless people use, such as park benches have been removed by the French state, in service to the wealthy. If you try and alleviate your homelessness, by squatting in an empty house that is being held by a bank or wealthy landowner as an investment, you will be evicted by the police and charged by the state. You cannot live outside, because once again, the spaces you try and occupy are being attacked by the state, forcing you further and further away from civilisation, and thus any chance of \"working your way up\", as the liberals of fond of telling those in situations like this. This state of affairs affects an estimated 140 000 people in France, including 30 000 children. While not on the same scale as the DPRK's oppression, *it is still oppression*. Add to this the discord sown by French arms trading, and foreign interventions in MENA, as well as the continued violence it exerts against its former colonies, and France's total oppression? I'd say it's greater in scope than the DPRK.",

They did nothing to improve the income or conditions for workers, indeed the outlawed unions were replaced with the German Labour Front tasked with increasing productivity and watching out for signs of disloyalty.

Basically, rich white men want to own everything, but standing in their way is the threat of democracy; the threat that all those dirty have-nothings might band together to take what the rich white guys stole. But this isn't a very popular way of framing the issue, obviously, so the rich white guys shift the argument from 'gimme moar!' to 'the rights of the minority must be defended from the tyranny of the majority'. Then you're not arguing for the powerful to have more power, but for the untrammeled rights of the individual to live free of the oppressive, 'collectivist' mob rule. Of course this completely delegitimizes any form of societal say on distribution of wealth, where wealth is properly the surplus production of the economy (being a social phenomenon) and NOT the profits of the owners of capital. But yeah, these political arguments are why many think 'democracy=mob rule' and 'republic=enlightened, rights-having liberty-loving Americanism'",

Why: 1: because capitalism creates class society and those of the upper class always have more power and thus always rule; and 2: the state exists to maintain said class society, even in getting rid of capitalism, the state’s main function (to preserve a class society) will always result in some new class rising to become the dominant class, this results in a system of “state capitalism” where, instead of a series of individual capitalists controlling the means of production, you have one big state controlling it.",

Wikipedia is good for definitions. opinions and things of the like? not really. they claim conspiracy analyses as conspiracy 'theories' when some of them are very well true and documented. so Wikipedia isn't some authority of information for me, but regarding the definitions of words, they are very effective. can you present to me where Karl Marx said that Marxism/communism mean \"government control of everything\"? because people who actually know Marx's work can literally tell you that he was an anarchist, as he advocated for a \"stateless\" society. I study political science and I know for a fact that these things, as well as my previous comment, are correct.\n\nMerriam-Webster: communism - \"a system in which goods are owned in common and are available to all as needed; a theory advocating elimination of private property\"\n\nthis isn't playing semantics, it's using the actual definitions of words rather than making up your own and believing they are correct. if I were to debate a Christian theist, would it be acceptable that I say \"Christianity is just worshiping Allah and praying over passover\"? no, because that is factually incorrect. when discussing ideologies with many different schools, it is always necessary to distinguish the difference between different ideologies.\n\njust as if I would be debating a Christian theist, I would have to specifically argue against things they specifically believe in based on their ideology. if I were debating a Catholic I would have to make sure to refer to things specifically that Catholics do, and if I were to refer to Protestantism I would be wrong. same if I were to debate a Methodist, I would have to distinguish that I am referring to the beliefs held by Methodists and not refer to beliefs held by Calvinists, Lutherans, or Baptists. they can all share some ideas like believing in a god and Jesus. but all of these ideologies are different and must be made clear which I am referring to.\nconversely, when listening to Jordan Peterson or Steven Crowder or Ben Shapiro, they never make this distinction. they lump everything under \"Marxism/communism/socialism\" despite history having multiple different schools of thought that are not specific to Karl Marx. so if any of these people want to discuss these ideas, they must distinguish if they are referring to Maoism, Leninism, Trotskyism, Stalinism, etc. but, they never do this",

You can start by arguing against their belief in something supernatural and unsubstantiated.  The particular window dressing they put on those beliefs don't matter in that context.\nWhich is what Peterson and Shapiro do with collectivist ideas.  They don't argue with the specific tenets of collectivism put forward.  Instead they say something along the lines of \"Humans won't act like that naturally and to make them act that way you'd have to have a giant government compelling them to act that way.  We already have a better system that rewards basic human desire with something much closer to the minimum of government tyranny.\"\nThere's nothing wrong with the discussion of the minutiae of collectivist schools of thought, but I think you're conflating that with the discussion of their real world application.",

        "text": "Antonio Notmyrealnamo - of course if I was to debate a Christian theist I would start with their belief in the supernatural and such. but I was only using that as an analogy for this instance. so the comparison is simply the different beliefs between different sects. so while all Christian sects hold supernatural beliefs, they have many beliefs that are contradictory or ones that are present in some sects but absent in others\n\nfor example:\nI cannot argue against beliefs of Catholicism if I am debating against a Protestant. take sainthood for instance. Catholics worship saints and raise certain people to sainthood. however, a Protestant person does not believe in sainthood and most (if not all) Protestant sects do not include the raising of individuals to status of 'saint' as in Catholicism. this is an important distinction because some Protestants argue that Catholic saint worship is idolatry and blasphemous and they are going to hell for worshiping saints. some Protestants even argue that Catholics aren't even Christians because they worship saints. this is a matter of life or death because if one is correct and the other is not, one of them could be doomed to supposedly going to hell. but no one knows because Christians can't agree on shit lol. but just as the same with things like baptism, not all Christian sects require baptism. so if I am debating against someone who is a Christian in a sect that does not include baptism, I cannot argue against baptism in this specific debate because my opponent does not adhere to that belief. so it is incredibly important to distinguish between different sects because they hold some different specific beliefs, whether it be Catholicism, Protestantism, Baptists, Methodists, Lutheranism, Calvinism, etc. they share many of the same beliefs, but they also have starkly different ones as well even though they all fall under the umbrella of \"Christianity\"\n\nsame for Marxism. I cannot argue against beliefs of Trotskyism or Stalinism if I am debating against a Marxist. so say we take 'authoritarian government' and state tyranny for instance. Trotskyism, Stalinism, Maoism include authoritarian governments and state tyranny. however, a Marxist person who adheres to the teachings of Karl Marx does not believe in these things, they would be advocates for the abolition of the state as Marx did and as Marxism inherently includes. (Marxism-communism: \"classless, stateless, money-less society\"). this is of course an important distinction because people who argue against tyrannical authoritarian government in a debate against a Marxist would be disingenuous and intellectually dishonest because a Marxist believes the state should not exist. so when people talk about Marxism and then they say \"authoritarian tyrannical government\", it is an inherent contradiction. so if I am debating against someone who is a Marxist who adheres to the belief of abolishing the state, I cannot then argue against state abuse of power or authoritarianism in this specific debate because my opponent does not believe in that. it is INCREDIBLY important to distinguish between different ideologies because they hold some different specific beliefs, whether it be classical Marxism, anarcho-communism, anarcho-socialism, Stalinism, Maoism, Leninism, Trotskyism, Sovietism, etc. they can share some of the same beliefs, but they also have starkly different beliefs as well even though they all fall under the umbrella of \"Marxism\"\n\n\"There's nothing wrong with the discussion of the minutiae of collectivist schools of thought, but I think you're conflating that with the discussion of their real world application.\"\n\n>I'm not. in fact, if we actually take a realistic view of history, I am applying the actual tenets of these ideologies rather than conflating them with what happens in practice. discussing the minutiae is important in this case, and very important in politics. just like this video said \"Hitler was a socialist liberal\". he cannot be both of those things because the ideologies have contradictory beliefs within them. listen to Professor Michael Parenti, he is the best person I have heard discussing these things. just like a Christian can be a Protestant or a Catholic, discussing the small differences is important because they have contradictory beliefs like baptism and sainthood. discussing the differences is important in politics and Marxism because there is classical Marxism that adheres to Marx's teachings and there are ideologies that came after by different people and a classical Marxist would believe in the abolition of the state (belief that a state should not exist) versus a Stalinist or a Maoist who would believe in authoritarian rule and tyrannical government. these are contradictory beliefs because one involves a state abusing its power and the other involves the abolishing of the state. the reason why is extremely prevalent because Marx despised governments and advocated for abolition of the state because of exactly what happened after him. he hated the abuse of power, he hated the fact that the state has a monopoly on the use of violence, he hated bureaucrats and oligarchic corruption of governments, and he believed the state only exists to protect the interests of the ruling class (the bourgeoisie)",

You explained it very well(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socialism#Early_socialism). Hitler proposed his Version of socialism, which didn't really work out.Thats why the Marxist socialists started protesting, and Hitler, as a socialist, redefined free speech. After that, no one could say what they really wanted to. These Retards say \"but he didn't agree with Marx\". You moron, that doesn't mean he is not a socialist. With that logic, I am not a Trump supporter, if I don't agree with all his policies, although I voted for him.   Another example: \"he was pro business\", Because Germany was fucking broke at that time. 1923: German value loses it's worth, 1929: great Depression, Germany: tons of debt. He had to go to the money bois, don't you agree? He was an authoritarian, he build an empire restricting Rights. It was not democratic socialism, but it was socialism. His policies and Marx' s brought the same result: hundreds of millions of innocents dead, an authoritarian state, loss of money, execution of rebells, censorship and many more. I think he was more of a right winger, but that doesn't really matter, socialism caused all this.  Marx seggregated People by their social status, Hitler by their race.That's the horseshoe Theory: left and right do different Things, but the result is the same. So it doesn't matter if Hitler was a leftist or a right winger, because we found out that national socialism is comparable to the democratic marxistic socialism.",

So the Nazi manifesto economic policies are  below:\n\n11 That all unearned income, and all income that does not arise from work, be abolished.\n12 Since every war imposes on the people fearful sacrifices in blood and treasure, all personal profit arising from the war must be regarded as treason to the people. We therefore demand the total confiscation of all war profits.\n13 We demand the nationalization of all trusts.\n14 We demand profit-sharing in large industries.\n15 We demand a generous increase in old-age pensions.\n16 We demand the creation and maintenance of a sound middle-class, the immediate communalisation of large stores which will be rented cheaply to small trades people, and the strongest consideration must be given to ensure that small traders shall deliver the supplies needed by the State, the provinces and municipalities.\n17 We demand an agrarian reform in accordance with our national requirements, and the enactment of a law to expropriate the owners without compensation of any land needed for the common purpose. The abolition of ground rents, and the prohibition of all speculation in land.\n\nAnd last but not least:\n25 In order to carry out this program we demand: the creation of a strong central authority in the State, the unconditional authority by the political central parliament of the whole State and all its organizations.\nThe formation of professional committees and of committees representing the several estates of the realm, to ensure that the laws promulgated by the central authority shall be carried out by the federal states.\nThe leaders of the party undertake to promote the execution of the foregoing points at all costs, if necessary at the sacrifice of their own lives.\n\nNow please feel free to point out to the world which of these where not socialist.\n\nAnd as for Hitler telling porkies - Germany had nationalised most of its industry before 33 due to the great depression. Hitler came in in 33 and after 3 years of massive building and welfare  programs he was required to privatise industry in order to raise funds after bankrupting the country. He willfully told the industrialists he was now a capitalist which was contrary to his continued determination of what was made and how much was made.\n\nHitler hated Marxists due to thier internationalist stance, but spent a life time blaming Jews, bankers and capitalists for the ills of the world. PS he tried to join the german socialist party in the 1920s which is discussed in Thomas webber latest book.\n\nYeah I don't bother forming arguments when the evidence is there.",

Perhaps I should define capitalism as according to how Ayn Rand defined it and not care about all the other theories regarding it?

You would know that western socialists heavily criticized the USSR's implementation of socialism or the lack thereof if you gave 1/10th of the attention to other socialists that you give to communists and capitalists that you want to portray as socialists like the nazis.\n\n\nMy definition, by the way, is the very first definition listed in the oxford dictionary that you ignore and make no mention of at all, because you're an ideological zealot, bent on making socialism to mean ideologies you don't like even if they're complete opposites on the economic scale.\n\n\nhttps://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/socialism  \"A political and economic theory of social organization which advocates that the means of production, distribution, and exchange should be owned or regulated by the community as a whole.\"\n\n\nThat is the first definition.

        "text": "@fvw1187 Really? Where does it say that? \"Separation of church and state\" doesn't mean \"no religion in public whatsoever.\" That may be how the Supreme Court in the 1960's reinterpreted it (the same Supreme Court that has a depiction of Moses with the Ten Commandments on it, plus Confucius) but that's not what the founders intended.\n\nAnd really, if you're going to freak out over any religious symbols, why aren't you going after other stuff? \"In God We Trust\", the All-seeing eye, Christmas parties in the public schools, etc. Why don't you object to the days of the week (which are named after the Norse and Greek gods)? Why don't atheists complain about schools that allow their kids reading the Percy Jackson series (which is literally based on the Greek gods) or take them on field trips to the local mosque for a religion class? I've even heard of two parents (Christian, not atheist) who complained about their daughter having to memorize a surah for homework! Seems to me you guys only object to Christianity, and you're ridiculously sensitive to it. If your kids can handle Islamic studies and Percy Jackson, surely they can see the Ten Commandments without being \"forcibly indoctrinated.\"\n\nWhat do you mean by \"people who support deeming Mexicans as racist and espouse hateful rhetoric?\" Which speakers are you referring to? What did they say? Please give me quotes. Not just \"they support anti-immigration laws\" or \"they don't like Muslims\" or \"they called Ocasio-Cortez stupid.\" We're talking about racism here. Not objections to religion, not sexuality, not IQ level, not legal citizenship. Purely biological ethnic racial issues.",

        "text": "Bluesaber Productions well that was a lot. Fuck man. I don’t know what group I’m a part of here but I can tell you I personally dislike all forms of religion being espoused by my tax dollars. And I meant to say referring to Mexicans as rapists. As that is what trump claimed. And just generally the right’s need to reject peer reviewed science or doj crime data to continually push a narrative that can’t be reconciled with the observable world. The revisionist history being corrected by this video is a prime example. Then when people correct the inaccuracies or disallow for propaganda to be shoved down college kids throats the right screams “censorship, you’re all fascists. Let me on your campus so I can spread misinformation and promote toxic politics not backed by science or data.” That is my assessment of how those things play out. \n\nThe ten  commandments specifically is an interesting legal question. Scalia had a minority opinion written about this subject that basically says the essence of the Ten Commandments is not inherently religious but he then justifies it by saying the essence or identity of objects is never defined by a universally accepted definition. I think the mental gymnastics Scalia did, while impressive and thought provoking, was ultimately excessively nihilistic. I think the Ten Commandments have a distinct relationship with Abrahamic religions. To your Percy Jackson point, I think as soon as people who believe in the pantheon of the gods also become people trying to infiltrate our education and our legal system to enact policy aimed at pleasing the gods, I will take issue with Greco Roman mythos being placed on public land as well.",

It  removes free markets and democracy and replaces it with a controlled and planned economy. \nIt always always ends up that way.  \n\nCapitalism is the twisted view of Karl Marx, nothing more or less. Marxs was a fwit who failed to understand even the basics of economics. The free market is exactly that free, and it has empowered and bettered the lives of billions. The problem with 95% of socialists is that they don't understand what socialisim is, they use words like justice and equality yet these words do not define socialisim. In fact they are the opposite of socialisim. Take Marxs love of capital, he simply takes capital in all its forms and places it in the hands of government! Which he says are the people, but you have a Platos  Republic type scenario now, as it must be a group like him/them who govern and the workers must do as they are told.... \n\nAdam Smith when defining the perfect free market noted that it must be regulated in order to stop individuals taking advantage. Well with socialisim you don't have to worry about this as the govt controls all and with it becomes the complete authoritarian regime. \n\nPeople think higher taxes to pay for the poor is socialist, nope this a fiscal policy not a form of socialisim, and it seldom works if you over tax anyway. Most people who claim to be socialist are social libertarians. If they actually are socaislist they will never tell the truth in relation to power and planned economies. \n\nNow do you believe in telling business how much must be of xyz. Do you believe that business must give away control to workers. Do you believe govt should have total control of the State completely  and of all earnings? Do you believe you and only you are smart enough to mange this? The socialisim has ALWAYS failed due to the fact it was  idiots who tried it before.... \n\nDude all the greatest economists of the last 50 years where at one point Marxists, then everything clicked and the became free marketeers.

Adam Smith stated clearly that regulation was required at times and not all services were private.\n\nHowever this is just a free market where certain aspects remain in  public hands. It is likley to be democratic as the provision of a  free market environment  is a necessity of democracy and liberty through its freedom of choice, but remember its not garunteed as it is not sufficient on its own (friedman). So are you talking about social liberatainsism? \n\n socialism is something entirely different. It removes ownership, it discourages choice and innovation and ultimately destroys democracy and liberty.\n\nSo what is a social democracy? If the free market still exists its not socialism, if its democratic, regardless of title it can not be socialist. So are we just talking about Liberal economics, a free market but where taxation is used to fund government works? If so we are already there, but it's got zero, zilch and nothing to do with socialisim. Democrats tax and spend, repbulicans encourage growth through lower taxation and regulation. Democrats want some more govt republicans less... But neither want socialism, well until sanders and cortez (really fn dumb people) \n\nIf someone tells you they are a socialist and talk about tax and fiscal spending, then they are either telling lies or are clueless. Most people are clueless these days because socialists lie to them.\" I want to tax the rich more and spend on the poor\" . This is not socialism so why vote for socialists. Socialisim now that's  taking ownership away, implementing a planned economy with predetermined supply and prices. I don't think you want that.\n\nOften people in America talk about scandanavia but sorry they ain't socialists! Just high taxation. If this is a social democracy fine, but beware of those hiding behind it with thoughts is actual socialisim. They just want adulation, they would happily burn the city to the ground in order to rule over its ashes.",

To central planned socialism purely as inbetween for communism.\n\nI reccomend doing some reading on it all, I find it fascinating and it's intresting to see some examples of working and still functioning communitys, towns and citys and some country's that pull off socialist economy's/policys and ideals in effective ways.",

        "text": "@AbstractTraitorHero Socialisim is an economic system where the tools of production are not held in the private sector but by the State. You can't change socialism. You can have another economic system or ideology which is not socialism, but for obvious reasons it cant be called socialisim.\n\nThe free market system, the thing you call capitalisim  because of   that twat Marx is called Liberal  economics, another thing which yanks don't get. Try reading Hayek, Adams riccardo even minskey or Keynes. Socialisim is a system where decisions about supply, price and ownership are taken  by a select few in government rather than people or the market, ie its a change in ownership of capital from the market ie the people, to a select group in government. It removes freedom and liberty and by its very fn nature is not democratic!!! . To call yourself a social democratic is ignorant beyond belief. Ask the Eastern Europeans what they think, ask them what provides a better life, and ask them why with the freedom of movement in Europe they don't go to the nordic country's? Feel free to ask. \n\nHitler was a socialist, Lenin, stalin Mao, pol pot..... Nice people. Nice company. \n\nAmericas poor are still significantly richer than the middle class of the majority of the world. Check it out. 30000 before tax is close to most of Europe and probably higher after tax. You remember it's about after tax. \n\nAs for health care, While most of Europe has a central insurance system it is much poorer than the US. In the US you are treated to cure, in Europe the majority of healthcare is symptom treatment ie it does not generally focus on prevention or cure. Oh yeah and why do medicines in America cost so much more? That's why your fn HI costs so much, but european manufactures say thank you. Do you really think centralising things will cut this. Nope, only attacking the manufacturers for the obvious fixing of prices will. \n\nTypically you read BS by morons with no economic qualifications who have no facts and only a Marxist narrative of us v them. Did you know Marx didn't work? Did you know he failed to gain any qualification in economics. \n\nSanders never ever clarifies what he means by democratic socialisim, but the DSA desires the change in the ownership of the tools of production.  Democratic socialists in Europe have produced the EU which has lead to mass poverty in southern Europe, they gave us higher CO2 in Germany in order to open all the old mines in Germany in order to boost their economy after the GFC, and also  allowed Germany to  turn a blind eye and as such provide state sponsorship to the  emissions scandels in German car manufacturing.\n\nIf you want higher taxes to pay for more public expenditure but don't want to change ownership then feel free to call yourself anything but a socialist. \n\nAlso the nordic model is cracking, it's not socialist or fn democratic socialist and is reliant on massive taxation which always leads to lower tax revenue (read keen, Michael not Steve ). While we are at it, have you ever left America? \n\nPS I was a socaislsit but I've read my economics inside out. I know what socialisim is and I know the difference between a failed economic system and arguing over fiscal policy in a Liberal system. I also know people who desire actual socialism love to hide behind the democratic tag while they desire nothing less.",

Capitalism is a hierarchy of resource distribution, with most power belonging to those who own the greatest share of the land and resources. It’s nuanced, but the nuance doesn’t really track. \n\nThe simple left-right spectrum works much better, but is likewise imperfect. Complex ideologies can’t be assigned strict positions in relation to each other on any kind of axis; the “left” and “right” distinctions are mainly just clusters of people who traditionally work together to achieve their goals.",

Yes Stalin was bad but so was Hitler. Are you going to blame the crimes of the Nazis on capitalism? I bet you won't. Is it possible perhaps that the crimes of governments have less to do with economic ideology and more to do with the fact that ALL GOVERNMENTS are authoritarian to some extent. All governments have militaries and police forces that use force to carry out the government's priorities. It is not as simple as saying communism is bad and capitalism is good. Both systems have good things and bad things about them and a hybrid system is probably the best way to go. The point is though you can decouple economic theory from what governments do because it is rarely linked to economic ideology although it is almost always linked to economics if that makes any sense.",

Though if you ask some southerners they’ll try to claim it was never about slavery so.. sounds like you have a bigger problem with them than me -.-Republicans did have more civil rights activists in the past. And then white southern democrats fled the party to the Republicans after the passing of the civil rights act which has created the modern paradigm. So wouldn’t the real important historical question there be why did Republicans embrace a bunch of super racist white southerners? And when you talk about Stalin, A) he’s considered one of the most evil people in human history. Like a challenge you to find anyone but one of the handful of genuine Marxist Leninists in America who still defend him, hell even the Remaining soviets took him to task once he died in the 50s. B) You demonstrated the exact point of the comment. By just labeling him as far leftists, you ignore historical context like how It stems from being an authoritarian leftists, just like Hitler was an authoritarian rightist. But you want to use the far leftists line because you think it’s a nice little shot taken at modern leftists.

        "text": "Ryan Hardison - ok so... I’m trying to piece together what you just tried to say there... pointing out to periods in the past where democrats were the racist party doesn’t absolve the current state of the Republican Party as being the more racially problematic. That would be like trying to argue that recent history Italy is a grand millitary power by pointing out the Battle of Zama or Alesia from the Roman era. And also, I don’t think I, or any serious historian has ever claimed that white people were exclusively evil in their slavery.  Nor did I ever learn that in a history book. What history does teach us is that the chattel slave trade conducted by European imperialists on Native American and then later African slaves was a uniquely cruel form of slavery that was notably harsher than how slavery was practiced in other parts of human history, including previous periods of European history. Attempting to point out that “other races did slavery too” is both ridiculous because that is something taught in school and trying to draw a false equivalence between a common practice in human history and the most brutal example of it. It’s like you’re trying to claim the Nazi’s holocaust wasn’t actually so bad because Jews have actually been persecuted and massacred by other Europeans for centuries going back to the First Crusade. Both are bad, but one is uniquely worse. And presenting counter examples the way you did is either being pedantic for pedantics sake which hey, I can appreciate that lol, or a deliberate attempt to derail modern political discussions on race, class, equality, etc.",

        "text": "@snappycaster I forgot what this argument was about...\nI guess it basically centered on how the Democrats and this video mislead people into believing Hitler was a capitalist. And then the 2nd debate was the idea that Republicans are racist or more racist than the Democrats. \nI'll dive into both of these again. \n\nThere is no way (no hard proof or witness testimonies) that actually suggest that hitler was a 'pure' capitalist, the best that you could come up with is that he was inconsistent in his economic beliefs (which means he occasionally adopted some capitalistic polices). Hitler allowed for some pivate land ownership, however i have already said that this does not automically make Nazi Germany a capitalist state as private land ownership isn't a trait that's exclusive to capitalism when you look at all the democratic socialist countries today that allow privitization. Hitler's Germany still contradicted capitalism in many ways, such as, lack of variable interest rates, assigning work instead of allowing people to choose, lack of free trade, etc. The 2nd main argument that is presented is that Hitler knocked off the so called \"socialists\" in his Nazi party. Hitler motivation for the night of the long knives was to increase his power/influence, not to rid the party of its socialists influences. This isn't the first time that a political leader knocked off his counterparts or even people that agreed with him, stalin killed communists/socialists.  Now at the same time, I have said that Hitler isn't a pure socialist either. Facism and Nazism are a little different, but Nazism is very different from pure capitalism and socialist. There really is no real racial element to socialism or capitalism. Capitalism, especially the lassiz-faire form of capitalism is SMALL government control, and hitler's germany simply had too much government intervention (social reform) to be considered actual capitalism. A capitalistic government is suppose to let the markets/people dictate the ebb and flow of the economy.\nPlus for someone who was so capitalistic in Adolf Hitler he seemed to be pretty critical of the system and pretty contradictory. Just read the 25 point plan.\n\nAs far as American politics are concerned, i think both parties are racist to a certain extent, but the gerneral platform of both parties are to put society as a whole in a good position.",

Secondly while it is true that Africans were the ones selling the Europeans slaves, the European powers created the demand for slavery, created the forts and trade posts where they bought the slaves, armed the slavers, financed the slavers, and bought the slaves. To try and absolve the Europeans for their role in the Trans-Atlantic Slave trade is unforgivable and intellectually dishonest.\nSecondly not only is it a self-serving claim to say that white people ended slavery it ignores the contributions of Freeborn blacks and former slaves in bringing an end to slavery and helping smuggle run away slaves to freedom.\nThirdly while it is true that for most of their party histories the Republican Party supported civil rights and the the Democratic Party bitterly fought civil rights. That began to change starting in the mid 20th Century. The platform change began in the 1940's with Democrats such as Roosevelt, Truman. A division began to form between the Northern Democrats and the Southern Dixiecrats. And this gap only widened as the civil rights movement progressed. Meanwhile a similar wedge began to form between Republicans and Civil Rights activists at the same time. Over time the Republican Party had gradually grown more and more anti-communist in nature exemplified by Joseph McCarthy. And you know who tended to support civil rights? Communists. Several prominent African American Civil rights activists were communists and communists in general tended to support the civil rights moment and this drove a wedge between Republicans and the Civil Rights movement. And then along came a man named Richard Milhous Nixon. Nixon capitalized on southern racism and the wedge that had been driven between Dixiecrats and Democrats with the Southern Strategy and his much more charismatic successor Reagan did as well and with the exception of the Bush's so did every Republican after Nixon.",

        "text": "@blixer8384 it actually does matter who started slavery because it puts things into perspective, which is important when the liberal narrative is that white people are behind slavery and had the worse slavery. It should also be noted that besides the fact that white people didn't start slavery, they are also one of the few races to end it, while slavery is still practiced all over Africa and Asia. White people are also a minority internationally while colored races make up the majority, so technically speaking colored races started slavery, have a longer history of slavery, while white people don't practice it anymore. \n\nWhenever a group of people has power over someone, slavery and segregation is often attempted. White europeans didn't always have the upper hand (see Islamic conquest and slavery of European nations).\n\nBringing up basic history is not absolving anyone. Europeans did some evil shit, but so did everyone else. Its important to understand that the basic human being has greedy, anti-social characteristics and is paranoid. You give a race power and they'll attempt to get more power by using institutions like slavery. We need to understand that all human beings are equally accountable when it comes to evil doings. Trying to say that one race is naturally more evil is very arrogant, and racist even; plus it denies basic history, \nreligion (if you believe in that) and scientific facts on the identity of a human being. This is also a dangerous mindset because you are putting unfair labels on white people (who mostly weren't around for slavery) and you are also giving yourself advantages over whites by giving yourself a victim (\"you owe me\") mentality.\n\nI never said blacks don't deserve credit for ending slavery, all i said was white nations (white majority nations) ended it. Yes, free blacks played a big role in the civil war but they were also still a minority within the country, white people in America easily could of continued to use slavery if they wanted to.\n\nYour narrative about mid-20th century to late 20th-century democrat politics is misinformed and is missing some key details. \n\nFirst of all, FDR imo is arguably the most overrated president in American history (and i hate to say that because i think he was great during WW2). FDR extended the great depression by about 7 years (its a democratic myth that he got us out; the post world war 2 boom got us out of the depression). And imo FDR seemed like he was a closet racist. I'll give you 2 racist things FDR did just off the top of my head. First, he mistreated Olympic hero jessie owens (Owens said himself that FDR snubbed him and hitler actually treated him better according to owens; FDR had a ceremony for the white olympians but not the owens who was the biggest star) and FDR set up internment camps for Japanese civillians. FDR also turned jewish refugees away, afterwards the pope and the catholic church saved thousands of jews despite being in the heart of facism. \n\nNixon was a racist too and probably an anti-semenite, but he still got sweeping affirmative action (Nixon got the federal government to use affirmative action) and welfare reform passed. You could say Nixon was playing politics, but what do you call what LBJ did? Obama himself said LBJ originally didn't want black civil rights, and that was before the 60s and Nixon and Eisenhower were already pushing for civil rights bills.\n\nWhat the actual fuck are you talking about with communism too?!? Excuse me for the language, but that makes no goddamn sense. Both parties hated communism (wasn't it JFK that hated cuba and LBJ got us into Vietnam) joesph McCarthy was a radical, both the left and right have radicals.\n\nSo you admit the Bushes did some things right with civil rights. If my statements about nixon are true (which they are, look it up) than that means 3 republican presidents pushed for civil rights. Not to mention trump got more blacks to vote for him then mccain or romney...",

It is also known as the Terror-Famine and Famine-Genocide in Ukraine. It was part of the wider Soviet famine of 1932–33, which affected the major grain-producing areas of the country. During the Holodomor, millions of inhabitants of Ukraine, the majority of whom were ethnic Ukrainians, died of starvation in a peacetime catastrophe unprecedented in the history of Ukraine\n\nAccording to the findings of the Court of Appeal of Kiev in 2010, the demographic losses due to the famine amounted to 10 million, with 3.9 million direct famine deaths, and a further 6.1 million birth deficit.\n\nSome scholars believe that the famine was planned by Joseph Stalin to eliminate a Ukrainian independence movement. Using Holodomor in reference to the famine emphasises its man-made aspects, arguing that actions such as rejection of outside aid, confiscation of all household foodstuffs, and restriction of population movement confer intent, defining the famine as genocide; the loss of life has been compared to that of the Holocaust.",

To that end, my criticism of liberal politics comes not in the form of being in favor of something undemocratic, but rather pointing out that it is not \"democratic *enough*, in that it doesn't even impose the will of the majority, but rather the wills of the elite, and from there highlight that trying to enforce your will on others is always going to fail.\n\nDemocracy is an ideal that should be aspired to, rather than a codified political system.

But we all borrow, more or less, from existing ideas and form our own opinions about things which already exist. You mention religion and seem to see it critically; would you not consider this part of an \"atheist\" ideology, or at least an idea that is \"adjacent\"? If you don't, and you in fact value religion, this could also be a part of your ideology. Either way, religious or not, both are conceptions which correspond to something ideological. \n\nI don't think ideology is narrowing; it is a method of categorizing and understanding.

In this respect I am a fanatical socialist, one who has ever in mind the interests of all his people. I am not the slave of a few international banking syndicates. I am under no obligation to any capitalist group. I sprang from the German people. My Movement, our Movement, is a German people's Movement\"\r\nhttp://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/adolf-hitler-speech-by-chancellor-hitler-to-the-nazi-party-in-munich-february-1941\r\n\r\n\"Even after the collapse of 1918 this bourgeois world had failed to realize that an old world was vanishing and a new one being born and that there is no use in supporting and thus artificially maintaining what has been found to be decayed and rotten, but that something healthy must be substituted for it. A social structure that had become obsolete had cracked and every attempt to maintain it was bound to fail.\"\r\n\r\n(The collapse of capitalism is inevitable!?  My goodness, where have I heard that before....)\r\n\r\n\"Thereupon Judaism began systematically to undermine our nation from within, and it found its best ally in those narrow-minded bourgeoisie who would not recognize that the era of a bourgeois world is ended and will never again return, that the epoch of unbridled economic liberalism has outlived itself and can only lead to its self-destruction and, above all, that the great tasks of our time can be mastered only under an authoritarian coordination of natural strength, based on the law of same rights for all and, thence, of same duties.\"\r\n\r\nhttp://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/adolf-hitler-broadcast-on-the-12th-anniversary-of-the-national-socialist-regime-january-1945\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Internally, in the \"coalition\" which we know only too well, they included all the enemies of the Reich, beginning with the Frankfurter Zeitung, and the entire stock market speculator-group...\"\r\n\r\n\"I am calm therefore when I face any German who is fighting in the East, or who comes home on leave-and I can tell each one of them, just look at our organization. Compare our home cities, compare the workers' settlements which we are building, compare our social organization with what you have seen on the other side. Compare the fate and the lot of the German farmer with the lot of that Russian farmer. Compare all of that, my dear friend, and then give me your judgment as to who has managed things better, and above all else, who has had more honorable intentions?\r\nNot one man has as yet returned, who could express any other opinion than that if a Socialistic State were in the process of being realized anywhere, it was in Germany only that it was actually taking place. That is still another reason why this other world which so willingly represents capitalistic interests in particular, is attacking us. It is a combine, which even today still pretends to be able to rule the world according to its private capitalistic interests, to manage it, and when necessary, to keep on ruling it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then I was making pilgrimages up and down through the German countryside, from North to South and from East to West, and wore myself out, only in order to save my people from this misery, into which these rulers of international capitalism had forced it.\"\r\n\"Regarding the material values, however, I believe them; they do have a fine instinct for them. But we have it too. The only difference is that we want to make sure under all circumstances that the material values of Europe will in the future benefit the European peoples also, and not an extra-continental little international finance's clique-that is our unshakable and inexorable resolve. The people of Europe are not fighting afterwards so that a few people of fine instincts should again come along and begin to plunder mankind and make millions of unemployed, just in order to fill their vaults.\"\r\n\r\n\"Above all, however, they will be happy if they themselves get the benefit of the reward for this work, if their peoples benefit, if their working men and women benefit, and not a vault which is in the Bank of London, if you wish, or in New York. I believe therefore that at the end of this war there will be collapse of this domination of gold, externally also, and thereby the collapse of this whole society which is to blame for this war.\"\r\n\r\nhttp://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/adolf-hitler-speech-on-the-19th-anniversary-of-the-ldquo-beer-hall-putsch-rdquo-november-1942\r\n\r\n\r\n\"She (Mrs. Roosevelt)-declined to live with her sons in a world such as the one we have worked out.

Since the USSR's socialism resulted in more murders, rapes, and general misery, obviously their version of socialism was actually more pure--but nonetheless, Hitler took pains to make it clear that he was an opponent of the Bolsheviks and that he had no issues with socialism--much like other socialists who war with fellow socialists, do not become non-socialist or anti-socialist.)\r\n\r\n\r\n(Amusingly enough, socialists are quite fond of reminding us that George Orwell, who accidentally wrote two of the most effective anti-socialist books ever, was a socialist--and yet Orwell viciously hated Russian Bolshevik socialism, declaring it to be an impure, corrupted version)\r\n\r\n\r\nBut wait--there's more!!\r\nNazi Germany even provided a 25-point program...\r\n7. We demand that the state be charged first with providing the opportunity for a livelihood and way of life for the citizens.\r\n11. Abolition of unearned (work and labour) incomes. Breaking of debt (interest)-slavery.\r\n12. In consideration of the monstrous sacrifice in property and blood that each war demands of the people, personal enrichment through a war must be designated as a crime against the people. Therefore, we demand the total confiscation of all war profits.\r\n13. We demand the nationalisation of all (previous) associated industries (trusts).\r\n14. We demand a division of profits of all heavy industries.\r\n18. We demand struggle without consideration against those whose activity is injurious to the general interest. Common national criminals, usurers, profiteers and so forth are to be punished with death, without consideration of confession or race.  (Emphasis mine)\r\n25. For the execution of all of this we demand the formation of a strong central power in the Reich. Unlimited authority of the central parliament over the whole Reich and its organizations in general.\r\n\r\nAND they put \"socialist\" right there in the name.",

I did, and he tried to make an argument out of the fact that hopeful people make the stock market go up, but still; kinda funny.)\r\n\r\n\"Hitler only furthered privatization in Germany. The exact opposite of what a Socialist would do.\"\r\nExcept here in the real world the German government privatized industries that it had no choice to when they were in desperate need of money, and stole far more than they sold.  The USSR also privatized several industries before they collapsed--even farms.  China and Vietnam have done the same--and like their fellow socialists in Germany, they did so because they had no choice.

Well, damn.\r\n\r\nNot to worry, though, I still got the knockout punch--remember that time they cut-and-pasted audio to create a racist statement where none existed from a defendant in a murder trial?  Damn those bastards at...\r\n\r\n...at MSNBC.  \r\n\r\nBut we at least have one--back when Stalin was still doing the socialist thing (wait, lemme guess, Stalin wasn't socialist either?), FOX News was busy shilling for him, pretending the Holodomor didn't exist and claiming his show-trials were eamples of due process.  Just what you'd expect from...\r\n\r\n...from the New York Times.\r\n\r\nSo yeah--\"your news source is a lot more honest than mine!\" isn't exactly the biting insult you were lookin' for.\r\n\r\n\"I also fail to see what your argument has to do with Hitler not being a Socialist.\"\r\nBecause we keep watching Leftists try to pretend that Hitler was the next Milton Friedman as a way to slander people.\r\n\r\n\"My opinions are based on Hitler's actions.

It was for this reason that Stalin later orchestrated the massive enforced famine called the Holodomor in the early 1930s, finally breaking the power of the farmers after killing millions of them, their families and their children. Thereafter Bolshevik agriculture was a mess (a later \"reform\", allowing farmers to work their own personal plots in addition to the communal farms, helped alleviate matters - although these tiny plots accounted for about 2-3% of cultivated land in the Bolshevik Empire, they yielded about 25% of the agricultural output).\n\nI really do suggest you do some more reading about agriculture under the Bolsheviks.

In fact it was the fact that the wealthy landowners had been burning crops and killing cattle to inflate prices in a time of famine that LEAD to collectivization of the farms. And the Soviets saved the people of the Ukraine by draining the Eastern grain reserves leaving the East open to Japanese invasion, a very real threat of the time, trace the sources of your Holodomor myth and all you’ll find is fascists",

        "text": "Well this will be a difficult conversation to have considering we have completely different definitions of certain concepts. I'll start here as it seems to be a big point of discourse: Hate speech is real. Revoking the platform of someone with antiquated and violent ideology, while it is globalist and leftist, is not violent intrinsically, as is the hate speech itself. But I'll give it to you, the examples you cited are violent on the part of the UK and Germany, and that is something those sovereign nations must tackle, though i really don't blame them for making such decisions, especially considering Germany's past. England will probably end up using their surveillance system to get rid of all the people of colour anyway, who are we kidding? But private entities such as Google, Facebook, Twitter can act as they wish, they don't set a precedent for other businesses. The government didn't mandate that decision, those corporations did. Besides, there are plenty of conservative platforms that block and curate liberal speech to their own agenda. Is that fascist behavior? To me that's people pursuing capitalist gain by appealing to the confirmation bias that most people have regarding their political beliefs. \nAs for private corporations becoming federalized, it doesn't seem that private enterprise or free market must be sacrificed in order to make certain voted-for institutions socialized. It doesn't have to be all in, where ALL private enterprise is socialized. And the state should be wary of dangerous ideological organizations, but that's not to say that anyone who is a Nazi sympathizer should be legally punished for holding such beliefs, regardless of the fact I personally believe they should. \n\nAs for Socialism itself, saying that it will fail on ideology alone is pure speculation on your part, and while you do have history on your side, it's impossible to prove that socialist policy as an exclusive abstract concept is a direct cause for fascism. Capitalism has facilitated violent fascists as well my friend, regardless of what they call themselves. Look at the civil war that the US is funding and perpetuating in Yemen by proxy of funding Saudi Arabia, all due to nuanced trade policy regarding arms and oil and a capitalist agenda that puts product and monetary value over human life. And to be honest, No, people can't control themselves. I don't trust you to do the right thing no more than you trust me to do the right thing. Regardless, we all have a base set of needs (food, clothing, shelter) that can be met through social organization of federal funds and institutions, and denying those things to everyone just because you can \"do it yourself\" is selfish to those who cannot pull themselves up by their bootstraps due to a vast array of reasons. And just because people have used similar Socialist institutions to assume authoritarian regimes doesn't mean that the ideas themselves were flawed. We can have it both ways! We can keep microbreweries and fucking McDonalds and still give people healthcare and a good education! You're making it an all or nothing thing, and that is the ESSENTIAL difference between Absolute Socialism and Democratic Socialism. Most all historical socialist turned into fascism because the public wasn't involved aside from throwing full political support TO a fascist, or there was heavy conspiratorial prejudice on the part of the States that implemented such policies.  \n\nAnd holding those beliefs doesn't make me a sheep that's sucking on the teat of big government, and it doesn't make me a fascist sympathizer just because fascists have used socialism to gain authoritarianism. It makes me someone who sees that there is already an incredible gap between how much wealth is accumulated by society and the people who are actually benefiting from that wealth. I can see the potential in the system that exists because it does have good bones, but people have to organize and take control of it. It has always been for the purpose of serving those who hold the power, and it always will until the bridge is built between government spending and the people it is being spent on. Democratically elected social spending could be a way to bridge that gap! Also unions working with those institutions to forge policy that benefits those groups idk just throwing things out there",

What are you going to do? Send me to a concentration camp to cleanse the world from weak minds?\n\nThat sounded like Hitler's campaign agains Marxism and Jews, or Lenin and Stalin's campaign against anarchism. Which Stalin said after the Spanish Civil War and I quote...\n\n\"Now the anarchist movement has been cleansed.\"\n\nI'm sorry to break it to you. But sounds a lot like you are not very different from those you attempt to frame as supporters of hate speech. I agree with Thomas Reed on this one. Go to your books and let people fight for education and information. People's judgment is to each one and not yours. Education can not be bad. Never. \n\nNow your YouTube comment \"doctrination\" is actually laughble. Education must always seek non-directional goals so people are able to make their choices you brat. I guess they skipped that at PragerU. I guess it must be hard to understand Hitler is part of the right? I duuno. As if no side has made a mistake. Of course, this is not a football match. We are talking about decisions that has real impact on human lives. So we must be responsible about those things. Also this video is really good and matches with academic studies. So pay attention to it.\n\nWell, nevertheless have a good day. And let me do whatever I want. After all what are you? The fucking brain police? Give me a break! LOL",

There is no such a thing as \"educate\" if you only tell what's convenient >\n\nthis is exactly the quality of education you can expect from the right and exactly why we have to educate people against this fox + alt reich propaganda. Can't even use the word influence without attaching an agenta to it. By the way, Marx was one of the most influential philosophers of modern times, everything was influenced by it and hitler was influenced by marx because he hated him and wanted to maintain totalitarian absolitist statism like what europe pretty much had been for hundreds of years during medieval times. \nAll right wingers ever do is quote mine, take it out of context and reapear it until the mud sticks because they have nothing going for them.\n\nMarx went on and on about how capitalism in his age was destroying families, disempowering the workers and creating a stratified society with built in systems of oppression for the sake of profit of the few. Workers back then didn't even have any rights. It was slavery and starvation. His goals was to educate the public and make them aware of the flaws of capitalism (which were real - competition drives exploitation) and believed they would eventually demand the cessation of the exploitation ON THEIR OWN if they knew what he had known. Right wingers, some of them in this video, to this day can't get over public education and so is this dipshit commenter. In a society without equal education opportunities we are back in feudal exploitation.\nThings Marx stood up for and wrote about - equality, justice, opportunity, taking care of the needy, education, democratic consensus building, peace between nations, workers own the means of production.\nThings capitalism stands for - Wealth. The fewer rights the workers have the better for the owners. The dumber the workers the less resistence they can put up.\nThings Nazis stood up for - unequal, unjust exploitation of non-germanic people for the benefit of their nation at the expense of every other, totalitarian authocratic decision making, militarism.\nCommunism in russia and china was quintessential statism and therefore not marxist. Neither was Hitlers Nazi germany. Peasant societies weren't capable of skipping the capitalism growth phase according to Marx. He wasn't for it.\n\nIf you don't believe me, go read the communist manifesto or anything else Marx wrote instead of listening to right wing propagandists who are trying to rewrite the history - complete with blaming the left for everything they are doing. The dumbest part is those shills are willing to destroy their own economy and prosperity to spite the face and \"defend\" the \"white race\" because \"team us is the best\".

        "text": "@Dav\nHey dude. Thanks for your response. \nYou've mentioned a lot but I shall address only as few of those things, for the sake of brevity.\n\nFirst and foremost: people with mental issues do not deserve physical violence, from no one. \n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nAbout identity\nPeople are not born with an identity. Identity is (partly) the self-image someone has. This self-image is not innate, it develops as the person grows older.\nAs far as I know, up until two minutes ago, the DSM-5 still labelled the mismatch between gender-identity and the actual genitals of a person as a mental disorder. \nI have many objections to the incorrect and ineffective way the medical field treats those people; that treatment has been moulded by PC views and it only exacerbates the problems. I will address only a few of my objections here.\n\n1. Psychiatry (better put: the APA) has sadly been infested with intellectual dishonesty and \"political correctness driven by the current zeitgeist\", ever since 50s and it went on from there.\nGood practice in psychiatry dictates that psychiatrists should not \"play along\" with people with identity disorders. \nExcept when it comes to gender identity.\n\n2. Giving surgery to people with gender-identity issues is as detrimental as giving liposuction to anorexic chicks. Look at the insanely high prevalence of suicide. Clearly, the approach of surgery has failed. \nIn the early days of psychiatry, certain mental disorders were \"treated\" with lobotomy. As the pharma industry developed better medication at the (informal) request of the field of psychiatry, the psychiatrists steered clear from lobotomy. The same should be done with people with gender-issues. No more butchering up patients through surgery, but more research into and development of better medication. That has been the goal of psychiatry for every mental disorder. \nExcept when it comes to gender identity.\n\n3. The ultimate goal of psychiatry never has been and never will be to make people happy (happiness after treatment is just an added bonus). The ultimate goal of psychiatry is to make patients function as well as possible in a society, or to reduce the dysfunction to a minimum level.\nExcept when it comes to gender identity.\n\nPsychiatry has failed those people time and time again. \n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nI'd like to make clear I should not have accused you personally of acting like a fascist. I should have known better than to lump an individual together with a group. \nHowever, there are definitely people that are starting to act creepy.\n\n\"...there is a 'T' in 'LGBT'. If you do not consider yourself affiliated with LGBT because of the T, that's your business, and I will not act like a fascist and say that you have to believe otherwise.\"\n\nAre you able to see you are already forcing me to share your view by lumping me together with the \"LGBT\" label? \nAre you able to see that the LGBT label is made up? It's not a real physical entity such as gravitational pull or the wavelength=spectrum for sunlight. It's been arbitrarily decided by a bunch of people. \nCan you imagine it's as annoying as christians calling me a sinner, even though I don't even share their concept of sin?\nNow add to that last question the notion of how this LGBT label is shoved down EVERYONE else's throat. \n\nLook at what's happening in Canada with their ridiculous mandatory-use-of-pronouns law. The State is forcing people to accept \"the trannie-agenda\" or \"face consequences\".\nLook at the case in California where an employee in a care home was sentenced to a $100,000 fine for \"misgendering\" someone. Now add to this case the current (and highly laughable) concept of gender-fluidity, where someone can change his mind from minute to minute.\n\nDamn.. I ran out of time for the rest... I really have to do some RL stuff now... I will come back to this later on, if you'd like that.",

        "text": "stonytina01 will-not-be-banned\nUsually when the DSM is used for a diagnosis it means that the person being diagnosed is already having difficulties that effect their lives. Kind of like how you don't need to call a plumber if your toilet is working fine. It also not really a condemnation of their condition, but rather a indication that this thing is effecting this person and treatment might be needed. That treatment can also be to have the person in question to transition to their identified gender. \nLikewise having ADHD doesn't have to be problematic so medication and treatment might not be necessary unless it starts having an adverse effect on the person's life. \n\n1. From what I gather (only) looking things up on the Internet it's not as simple as you paint it to be. Before they \"play along\" (as you call it), they have to account for other disorders and the psychology of why they want that change (for example because of certain advantage the gender identity has or because they haven't accepted their homosexuality).\n\n2. The comparison with lobotomy is a rather crude one. Lobotomy was a crude surgery on the intricate and complex brain. Whereas gender reassignment surgery deals with less complex, better understood body parts. \nNot to mention that a larger part of the reassignment is hormone treatments and surgery is not always performed. \nAlso studies show that the gender reassignment does indeed help with the gender-dysphoria. After the procedure and surgery these people do have less stress from being in the wrong body. \nThe rate of suicides isn't associated with their gender-dysphoria, but from social factors such as not being accepted by friends and family and discrimination (https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0924933817318357). \n\n3. Again you are misconstruing why people come to psychiatry in general. Mostly they come when there are already problems with which they can't seem to deal appropriately with. Despite your insistence that the treatment for transgender people isn't aimed at getting these people to function better in society and to help them reduce the way their problems are effecting them, that is exactly what is happening. \n\nAlso you are seriously misconstruing what is said in the Canadian Bill. All it does is add trans-gender people to the classes that are protected under current discrimination laws. Meaning that they receive the same protections from discriminations as many minority groups (such as homosexuals) currently receive under Canadian law. This does not involve mandatory use of pronouns, despite what YouTube reactionaries might want you to believe. It does for example protect them if they are fired for being transgender. \nAlso the case you mention, is conspicuously absent from the web. I do find some references to a law being passed in California in which health-care professionals could be fined for discrimination for willfully and continuously misgendering transgender people (max $1000,-). Notice the willfully part to see that the law is more nuanced that you are letting on. Though I do think proving intent in such a case is hard and as such the law seems to be little more than symbolic.\n\nI do find it ironic that someone who's sexuality is likely to have been dismissed at least once in his life and is part of a group that for years were considered mentally ill and in need of being cured, can't even consider that a transgender person could be facing similar.",

It's true that he had been a socialist and admirer of Marx in his young years, but that soon became violent opposition and facism was a part of his opposition to socialism and marxism.\nAlso, you know that Marx was a jew, right? Hitlers hated him and his ideas almost by definition. Also yes, there were private businesses under the nazis. Later in the war, they forced everyone that could to build weapons, but that's fairly common and did not mean, the businesses weren't private anymore and most businesses remained untouched by this, since they couldn't produce weapons even if they wanted.\n\nI again encourage you to actually watch the video and maybe read a history book or two, because most of the points you make have been debunked right above this comment section or are factually wrong and I'm getting tired of constantly havin to correct this.",

There were a lot of private businesses in Nazi Germany. In fact, there were almost no state businesses - after the Nazis privatised most that existed before. These private businesses had independence and signed quite favorable treaties with the government, which paid them money while being in debt - which would make no sense, if the businesses weren't actually private. It was only later in the war that the Nazis regulation got tighter, because they needed to cramp out as much war material as possible - as I said, quite common in a war - and still businessmen owned their own businesses and could make their own decisions. Ever heard of Oskar Schindler? He used that power to save hundrets of jews, which would have been unthinkable, had his business actually been run by Nazis.\nAnd please don't mention PragerU. It's a far-right big-business lobbying organisation and I have yet to encounter a single good video from them (believe me, I've seen many). Also, that's not how it works. I have already seen and heard virtually every argument from the far-right on this issue, and I'm not gonna just watch more footage of people telling me the same lies again. If you want me to debunk any specific argument, I'll do that for you, but you're gonna have to research the arguments yourself.\n\nLastly, it's sometimes hard to understand what you are writing - please use proper punctuation and put a little effort into communicating clearly, thanks!",

The whole of National Socialism is based on it.’Why’, I asked Hitler, ‘do you call yourself a National Socialist, since your party program is the very anthesis of that commonly accredited to Socialism?’\n\n‘Socialism’, he retorted, putting down his cup of tea, ‘is the science of dealing with the common weal [health or well-being]. Communism is not Socialism. Marxism is not Socialism. The Marxians have stolen the term and confused its meaning. I shall take Socialism away from the Socialists.\n\n‘Socialism is an ancient Aryan, Germanic institution. Our German ancestors held certain lands in common. They cultivated the idea of the common weal. Marxism has no right to disguise itself as socialism. Socialism, unlike Marxism, does not repudiate private property. Unlike Marxism, it involves no negation of personality and, unlike Marxism, it is patriotic.\n\n‘We might have called ourselves the Liberal Party. We chose to call ourselves the National Socialists.

Democracy has never been and never can be so durable as aristocracy or monarchy; but while it lasts, it is more bloody than either. Remember, democracy never lasts long. It soon wastes, exhausts, and murders itself. There never was a democracy yet that did not commit suicide. It is in vain to say that democracy is less vain, less proud, less selfish, less ambitious, or less avaricious than aristocracy or monarchy. It is not true, in fact, and nowhere appears in history. Those passions are the same in all men, under all forms of simple government, and when unchecked, produce the same effects of fraud, violence, and cruelty. When clear prospects are opened before vanity, pride, avarice, or ambition, for their easy gratification, it is hard for the most considerate philosophers and the most conscientious moralists to resist the temptation.

        "text": "No \"redefinition\" necessary. More like the process whereby a word eventually means how it is used. The Left and Right used to define a specific dichotomy - Leftists were in favor of redistribution and leavening of power (republicanism, democracy, universal suffrage, private property rights, etc) while the Right were monarchists in favor of absolute rights for a hereditary elite. Karl Marx tried to redefine the new Left as the working classes and the new Right as those who owned and controlled capital and the means of production, but this revisionism unraveled when Marxist socialists seized control of capital and the means of production, brutalized and exploited the working classes, then set themselves up as a hereditary socialist elite with absolutist powers. The paradox is, thus, this new Left became the old Right, declaring anyone and everyone who did oppose or might oppose them, or just happened on the menu for one reason or another, as the Right/far Right/alt-Right/etc.\n\nBritish imperialism wasn't especially good, but it wasn't Leftist. The rampaging Mongols were not Leftists either. What is characteristic of the Left as we know it today is the secular religion of socialism, used as the justification for their sacred absolutist powers over everyone else. Because of socialism, and because their enemies are \"capitalists\" and \"fascists,\" they claim the moral license to do whatever they like to whomever they like in pursuit of their revolution and the socialist greater good.- which invariably just so happens to be whatever is in the best interests of their specific faction of socialist capital-hoarding elite.\n\nSo it was with the Bolsheviks. So it is with the Maoists. So it was with the National Socialists also. No, I do not see the need to separate National Socialists as far as possible from other socialist groups that did very similar things for very similar reasons, using the same sort of socialist ideology as justification. I would object to someone claiming the Thuggees were socialists rather than Hindu. So also I object to socialists with the audacity to claim that National Socialists were, say, \"end stage capitalists\" or libertarians or Christian fanatics or anything else but the socialists that the National Socialists repeatedly claimed to be and which they in fact were.\n\nSocialism once had lofty meaning in the 19th century. In the 21st century it has come to refer to a despotic scam. We are literally watching another empirical example of this odious scheme as it unfolds in Venezuela. No doubt in the future some eager and unscrupulous socialists will pretend Maduro's government wasn't socialist either, well after the fact. If I am still around at the time, I will be happy to remind them otherwise.\n\nPS: I'm glad you realize that the National Socialists were \"bad.\" One couldn't expect as much from a Left fascist activist in 1940. Progress may be slow at times, but it is inevitable.",

        "text": "@DrCruel national socialist were not socialist. The goal of socialism is to ultimately give workers the ability to run the nation. Granted the USSR ruined it due to Stalin's paranoia. However, fascism ultimate goal was corporate syndaclism or as gentile argued for a mixture, and a lack of differentiation between corporate, and public. Socialist reject the private sector as a whole as they view it as exploitative, fascist do not reject it but want the state and private to be indistinguishable from each other into a collective system between the two. To fascist the nation was above everything. A glorification to the past. Though let me make this distinction. Fascism is not nazism. Nazism is a subset of fascism. To fascist the nation was everything to the nazi only racial purity mattered. Socialism viewed both the state, race, and relgion divisive to the working class. Like I said again Mussolini was a socialist but like he said in 1919 \"socialism as a doctrine was already dead; it continued to exist only as a grudge. Also to further emphasize he did not follow the Austrian school, he drew inspiration from vilfredo pareto who also praised Mussolini.",

        "text": "National Socialism was most certainly socialist. The goal of socialists is to trick workers into letting them into power, then robbing everyone blind. They have done this numerous times in the 20th century and are literally doing the same today. Stalin only continued Lenin's policies - he was a scapegoat for the institutionalized criminality of Bolshevism, which continued right up to the end of the Bolshevik Empire.\n\nNeither socialists nor fascists escape capitalist economics. They simply replace the people who earned the wealth by a new managerial class of professional criminals. If the regime lasts any serious length of time, this elite frequently become hereditary. This was the main problem with Bolshevism - the heirs of the early socialist thieves had been raised in affluence, and neither had the talents nor ruthlessness to run a criminal empire. Time will tell if this becomes a problem for the fuerdai of communist China.\n\nNational Socialism is related to Fascism only because it came after. Fascists got their ideas from Marxism-Leninism. Likewise all the major socialist regimes were nationalist. In Bolshevism the Russians were dominant while in Maoist China the Han Chinese are dominant (this would be one of the main causes of their falling out). For Juche it is North Koreans, for the Khmer Rouge it was the Cambodians and for the Ba'ath it was the Arabs. In fact, some Ba'athist leaders openly acknowledged that their ideology borrowed from both National Socialism and Bolshevik socialism.\n\nThe socialist scheme took several forms. In the Marxist trend, the major factions were the Bolsheviks and Maoists. Among the fascist socialists, it was the National Socialists of Germany. ALL of these regimes were socialist.\n\nPS: Don't forget that many socialists, including the Fabians, praised Mussolini as well.",

That being said the fascist or national socialist goal were not to trick the working class. They didnt care. The fascist wanted the working class to be indistinguishable from the state or nation, and to work solely for the betterment of the nation. The nation being its religion. National socialism goal was an ethno nationalist state. Anything else was a derivation. Yes, they disliked some aspect of capitalism only because some jews had control. However, that does not mean they were against the aryan capitalist. They were quite in favor of it as long as they were aryan. To the socialist aryan, jew, black, women it doesnt matter. The exploitation by the working class regardless of the gender or race of the upper elites constituted an issue. \nA combo of the both socialism and nazism is strasserism named after Gregor strasser. He escaped Germany in the 1930s after hitler tried to kill him. Yes there was a leftist faction in nazism. They were killed off in the night of long knives. The person who ordered them killed was hitler. If you're going to criticize the left about strasserism then fine, it's a shit ideology anyway.",

        "text": "Well guess what. It fits the empirical evidence. It's true for all these iterations of socialism. Or I can take your word for it. Guess which way I go.\n\nTricking the working classes was necessary to get into power. Remember that these movements were relatively weak when they started. If the people knew what socialists were really up to, they would have crushed them early. If Kerensky's Duma or the Weimar Republic had realized what the socialists had in store for them, we may never have known who Lenin, Stalin or Hitler were, as they would have been executed before they had established a foothold.\n\nAll socialist regimes practiced crony capitalism. The Bolsheviks were quite comfortable dealing with foreign corporatists, and were especially fond of Henry Ford and Armand Hammer. What is lost in Marxist theory is that expropriated factories and other big capital investments must be managed by someone. These individuals become the new capitalists in the socialist Party Order. As for worker exploitation, the Bolsheviks were especially brutal and creative. I suggest reading *The History of the Gulag* by Oleg Khlevniuk for some background on that.\n\nFor decades I was serenaded about the wonders of Bolshevik socialism - right up until the collapse. Come to find out it was in practice almost identical to National Socialism. Imagine my surprise. Now I'm given the same snowjob about Bolshevist \"state capitalism\" that I get about National Socialist socialism. I guess I shouldn't be surprised.\n\nYou'll have better luck with someone who doesn't know better. Nice try though.",

It was written in my struggle. Socialist fought against him to prevent him taking power though it didnt help considering the outcomes. Kerensky Duma expected the Paris communes. Soviets were quite upfront about it as well. So yes they knew what to expect. Socialist also expected for western nations to prevent them from taking power hence the civil war between the whites and the reds. \nYes, worker factory managed system do work. Hell, even in our current capitalistic system worker based system exist like mondragon in Spain. Not sure why you are assuming they don't. Maybe due to lack of an example?",

        "text": "Hitler used the fear of Bolshevism, and with good reason. The Bolsheviks had already tried to take over Germany; unfortunately for the Bolsheviks, the Spartacist uprising was crushed by German war veterans by 1919 and the Red Army's invasion of Poland was stopped at the Vistula in 1920 . Germans were terrified of the growing Bolshevik menace, enhanced by regular declarations and promises by the Bolsheviks that one they they would \"liberate\" Germany. Needless to say, turning to Hitler and his gangster socialist crew in their desperation was a Faustian bargain.\n\nThe Russian peasants were promised \"Peace, Land and Bread\" by Lenin, and bought into the lie. They instead were forced onto communal farms owned by the state, a form of serfdom which they rebelled against. In retaliation, the Bolsheviks made brutal war on them and deliberately starved millions to death. When the peasants were fighting and dying so that the Bolsheviks could overcome the White Armies, they did not realize they were signing their own death warrants. I don't expect they would have fought so hard if they knew how they would have been betrayed by the Bolsheviks, regardless of the blocking attachments that Trotsky used to herd them forward. So also, I don't expect the Germans would have been so enthusiastic about the National Socialists in 1933 if they knew what was in store for them in 1945. And so on.\n\nNote also that the socialists helped Hitler when it suited their interests. The all-out German offensive against the French in 1940 would not have been possible without a National Socialist alliance with the Bolshevik socialists in 1939, but then the Bolsheviks had a few neighbors they wanted to crush and absorb into their empire as well. Like a shark, socialist regimes are always eating, and if they can't raid and absorb new victims they slowly starve to death.\n\nPS: Again, socialism is a scam. It has nothing to do with empowering workers. It has nothing to do with liberating anyone. It's about socialists making themselves into aristocratic despots. Workers and management cooperate in some of the most successful firms in Germany, but this isn't \"socialism,\" because the Bolshevik Empire threatened West Germany regardless, long after the Second World War, for being ruled by the \"decadent bourgeoisie.\" So no, I don't believe socialist bullshit and propaganda, but this has nothing AT ALL to do with my sentiments regarding worker rights. In fact, I would go so far as to say one of my main reasons to oppose socialists is because I respect workers and worker rights. I do NOT respect the \"right\" of Bolsheviks to rob and kill business owners and enslave workers in gulags \"because Marxism.\"",

        "text": "No Nazism has nothing to do with socialism. Socialism is the belief that the collective, the cooperative, has the best ability to solve economic and political problems. Socialists often claims that what is best for the collative is also best for the individual. Nazism claim that the need of the nation outweigh the need of any individual need. Hitler wrote. \"Democracy has ruined the world and now you want to extend it to the economic sphere. That would be the end of German housekeeping. The capitalists have worked through their proficiency and they are entitled to lead because they have been separated from the crowd and only prove that they are of higher race. Now you want an invisible government council or work council, who does not understand anything, to have a say. No one who leads industrial companies would tolerate that.\" And that is way nazism is a form of fascism because the core of the fascist ideology is that the need of the nation is allot more important then the need of the individual or a group of people. The state or the nation is so important for both fascists and nazists that it's worshiped as a god. The only ideology that has the word socialism in it that inspired Nazism is Social Darwinism. According to social darwinism do, individuals, groups, classes and races compete in a constant power struggle. The strongest survives, which leads to a continuous development towards higher standing societal forms. In the long run, social darwinism can be used to legitimize political views towards \"hostile\" or \"lower standing races\". It has nothing to do with Karl Marx.",

        "text": "Socialism is commonly regarded as an economic system that seeks to achieve equality among members of society. Communism, on the other hand, is both an economic system that seeks equality among members of society and a political ideology that advocates a classless and stateless society and rejects religion. It is regarded as a more extreme form of socialism.\n\nSocialism and communism both adhere to the principle that the resources of the economy should be collectively owned by the public and controlled by a central organization. They differ, however, in the management and control of the economy. In socialism, the people themselves decide through communes or popularly elected councils on how the economy should work. This makes socialism a liberal system because majority of the people have a say on how the economy should be run. Communism, on the other hand, controls its economy through a single authoritarian party. It is thus characterized as conservative because the economy functions based on the decisions of a few.\n\nThe views of socialism and communism also differ in the distribution of wealth produced by the economy. Socialism supports the view that the goods and services produced should be dispensed based on the productivity of an individual. In contrast, communism believes that the wealth should be shared by the masses based on the needs of the individual.\n\nThere are two kinds of properties in socialism: (1) personal property that an individual can own and enjoy; and (2) industrial property that is dedicated for the use of producing society’s goods. Individuals, for example, can keep their digital cameras but cannot retain a factory that produces digital cameras. While personal properties can be kept, socialists make sure, however, that no private property will be used as an instrument for oppression and exploitation. In comparison, communism treats all goods and services as public property to be used and enjoyed by the entire populace.\n\nFinally, socialism and communism differ in their views on capitalism. Socialists regard capitalism as a threat to equality and public interest. They believe, however, that there is no need to eliminate the capitalist class because it can be used as a good instrument in the transition to socialism as long as it is properly controlled. Socialists also believe that capitalism can exist in a socialist state and vice versa. From the point of view of the communists, capitalism must to be destroyed totally in order to give way to a classless society.",

They're labels, but they're not separate; they're together. I made up the analogy that if you saw someone kicking a baseball and they said they were playing a game called \"baseball-soccer\" you'd be right to point out that they are neither playing baseball nor soccer, but you wouldn't be so dense as to not understand what this person was saying. The same can be applied to postmodern neomarxism in the Contrapoints video and to the National Socialism of Hitler's Germany. Are there aspects of both Nationalism and Socialism in 1930s Germany? I think an easier case can be made if you don't try to strictly apply the definitions of labels to the words being used and try to be a bit more charitable. The fact is, when you argue over labels, you're avoiding discussing what is behind the cognitive shortcut of the label, and you will often cherry pick your favorite parts, which is kind of necessary. Secondly, when you hyphenate or portmanteau two different labels, the result is not going to be synonymous with either of those labels.\n\nSo yeah, you if you think this applies to you.

What isn’t under dispute though is that prior to voting Nazi, Nazi voters voted for center-right and far-right parties, or didn’t vote at all. Support for the Nazis did not come from disaffected left-wing or center-left voters, but from right-wing voters frustrated with the existing parties of the right.\r\nIn my view this point alone is decisive. The meaning of right-wing and left-wing is not an ahistorical abstraction, it’s created by the behavior of people and institutions. The right-wing citizens of Germany implicitly recognized the Nazis as right-wing by voting for them, case closed\r\n\r\n2. The Nazis literally invented privatization:\r\nThe Nazis were responsible for huge privatization programs. The extent of their privatization's was enormous, but it was particularly vast when compared with other countries at the time, who were generally moving in the opposite direction. The privatization's of Nazi Germany may indeed have been the first mass privatizations of public property in history and included “Steel, mining, banking, shipyard, ship-lines, and railways.” More on how Nazis bucked historical trends by privatizing when no one else was here: http://www.ub.edu/graap/nazi.pdf\r\n\r\n3. Nazi policies greatly increased income inequality:\r\n\r\nIncome inequality spiked under Hitler, as was observed even at the time. More here: http://piketty.pse.ens.fr/.../RefsHistorical.../Sweezy39.pdf\r\n\r\n4. Capital as a share of factor income also spiked under Hitler, at the expense of wages:\r\n\r\nFactor income describes the division between the factors of production, with land receiving rent, capital receiving profit and labor receiving wages. The capital share, or profit as a proportion of total income, increased by about 50% in Nazi Germany and was much higher than the US’s capital share at the time. See the below graph from Capital in the Twenty-First Century reproduced in a Jacobin article by Corey Robin:\r\nI’m sorry if there’s not much in the way of Belles-lettres here. If I am blunt it is for a purpose. The Nazis were right-wing. Anyone who tells you otherwise is wrong, much in the same way it is wrong to say that the world is flat, six-thousand years old, or made of cheese",

I should also not that Hitler arresting certain socialist or communist factions doesn’t necessarily make him right wing or not a socialist. In the USSR the Bolsheviks (who were undeniably left wing) arrested many communist/socialist groups who’s view of socialism they disagreed with, such as the Mensheviks. And Hitler making the Nazi party the only legal party in Germany doesn’t make him right wing either. In the USSR (still a very left wing regime) the communist party was the only legal party. Same goes for China, North Korea, and every other communist regime to ever exist. Literally every communist regime to ever exist has been an authoritarian one party police state, much like Nazi Germany was, and I think that we can both agree that communism is an exclusively left wing ideology.",

The \"market\" added to market Socialism comes from the ideologies it seeks to combine, Free Market Economics, and thus no controls on that Free Market, within a Socialist Economy, as opposed to Planned Socialism. This means that trade is decided between the participants, there is no control on what can be legally bought or sold insofar as it doesn't take an Individuals rights (slavery especially) while laborers are the ones running the market rather than Capitalists, there is no control on what an employee makes by someone out to make only profit.

        "text": "Americans kill Americans.  Yet to many in the outside world, apparently we're all center-right compared to them.  My understanding is that both highly favored government with a social engineering agenda, but the ultimate goals of said social engineering is different.  Communism seeks an equal, classless society, whereas Fascism sees hierarchy as beneficial for a more efficient society.  Communism seeks fairness, while Fascism seeks greatness.  One is international, the other is national.  Otherwise, it does still stand that both have government policies explicitly intervening in the social welfare to sculpt a specific social order.  In that sense, both are socialist.\n\nDefining Nazism is a  complex affair.  I would consider it both progressive, because of its strong intervention in everyday life and ambitious goals, but also socially conservative, in that it wished to protect pre-existing norms for national identity.  However, it was not fiscally or governmentally conservative.  It was Right Wing in that it did not concern itself with redistributing a hierarchy (I'm going by the French definition of the Right).  It was highly liberal in its use of government, but it did not take an actual liberating view of human beings.  It was socialist in that it dictated the social order.\n\nThe funny thing is, when people claim that Nazism has things in common with Republicans or Democrats, nobody's entirely wrong.",

        "text": "Socialism is a very broad umbrella term, and it's hard to actually pinpoint a precise conventional meaning seeing as there are many political conventions that have defined it .  It's broad enough that it has a lot of application.  Most governments count as socialist in the most governments have a socio-economic agenda.  Socialism isn't necessarily the same thing as welfarism; it does not always redistribute from wealthy to proletariat.  It's basically any state where means of production are either owned or strongly influenced by the government/public.  I tend to veer from using the term \"dictatorship\" freely, for while it's supoosed to refer to a strong and tyrannical government, there's no universal consensus on where the line is drawn to define a government as dictatorial.  Americans do not consider their country to be a dictatorship, for example, but Canadians might disagree.  Actually, at any given point of time, about 50% of Americans will conveniently define their government as a dictatorship.  Therefore, I try to define governments by their structures and their political objectives.  \"Socialist\" tends to describe most governments throughout history, because as I've said, most governments do have objectives pertaining to establishing a desired socio-economic order.  Whether or not the desired outcome is a an efficient hierarchy or a classless society, I consider both to be socialism.",

In a fascist society, it is everyone’s purpose to serve the government.

We usually say that socialist societies are somewhere in between communist and capitalist, even though just looking at those definitions, it could be used to describe countries under either system.

        "text": "MajorLeague the issue with your argument is you’re talking about something fundamentally different than what is discussed in the video. I’ve already said, if you look at the nazis purely from an economic standpoint, their economy is completely anti-capitalist, other than what I’ve mentioned about supercompanies. Anti-Capitalism does not equate to socialism. The nazis were a far right party in almost every aspect; and the entire economy was built for the purpose of serving the state. That is the literal definition of fascism. Sorry if I’m not giving concrete examples, it has been awhile since I read rise, but I don’t think that invalidates my opinion. The nazis tried to mask their attempts to turn a capitalist Weimar economy into a fascist, totally focused on war building economy under the mask of a socialist movement yes, and some of the things they did using a broad definition could be categorized as socialism. That said, the fundamental issue with what you’re arguing about fascism is that it must be “super capitalism.” That is not true. Super capitalism is anarchy, which was also a popular movement in italy. Italian fascism rose as more of a blend of right winged ideas than naziism, and that is why the Italians more resembled the economy you describe. A fascist economy in its heart exists solely to serve the state, and to maximize its production potential, it is not some super capitalist society where the government does not interfere in the economy. There is also no way you can argue as the video states that the nazis were left wing, if you consider their social views at all",

I've always known that the term \"National Socialist\" was a propaganda misdirection and that the Nazis were viciously anti-Marxist and anti-Socialist, but I would get into actual arguments with people about this who just see the word \"Socialist\" in the NSDAP name and jump to conclusions. Also people here think any expansion of government is \"Socialist\", which it isn't. Socialism is workers owning the means of production vs. Nazism where the state is the number priority in life and also that the Aryan race should dominate the planet. Those two aren't the same thing as Marx advocated the ultimate extinction of the state in the Communist Manifesto (and from what I know wasn't an anti-Semitic lunatic). And like you said capitalism remained throughout most of the Third Reich but always subservient to the needs of their racist agenda. This is a scary time in the USA where fear and hatred of the other have become mainstream and vast social inequities and government corruption dominate.

        "text": "I said you were a low IQ, Fox News watching Trump supporter? News to me.\n\nWhat's wrong with what you said? Firstly your statement that the progressive left is against free speech, and individual liberty is simply not true. I know, of course, what you're referring to when you talk of \"suppression of speech\": no-platforming. This is actually a very interesting question which free speech absolutists tend to overly simplify. Firstly, there's a difference of freedom of speech and entitlement to be platformed (this should be apparent, unless you're in favour of having random strangers have the right to come into your house in order to exercise their freedom of speech). That said, without a platforms freedom of speech is meaningless, and many universities are (at least in part) funded by the government (not certain how true this is in the US to be fair, but it's definitely true here in the UK) which raises questions on whether they can legitimately no-platform. For the former, despite their insistence on the contrary, the right wingers who claim their freedom of speech is being suppressed due to no-platforming at universities are being disingenuous since they inevitably do so using one of the many other platforms available to them (YouTube, Facebook, Twitter and, often, traditional media). As for the latter I'd argue that, since universities have limited resources for hosting speakers they will inevitably have to refuse some: the question is what the criteria for selecting who gets to speak are. The purpose of universities is, amongst other things, to encourage debate and discussion, and I'd argue that that's not the aim of people like, say, Milo Yiannopoulos. In these cases if a university decides not to host a speaker I'm not going to cry over their (in reality not) suppressed speech. However if there is a genuine discussion to be had, even if its on a topic many find unpleasant, I am broadly against no-platforming if for no other reason that it has the opposite effect i.e. it tends to promote the speaker. This transcript of a speech on the issue - https://www.currentaffairs.org/2018/03/transcript-of-davidson-college-speech - by Nathan Robinson is well worth a read.\n\nWhat puzzles me is why such a big deal is made of this issue however. A handful of people who already have very large platforms available to them are being refused an, ultimately, very small platform at universities is worth coverage by the media, but the active suppression of voters by Republicans is not? \n\n\"Which of those names I gave were not on the \"left\"?\" Most of them. You can't trust the labels that authoritarian dictators adopt. Those who seek power will claim to be whatever happens to be expedient. Instead look at their actions. To call (most) of them leftists is simply ignorant of what the left believes. Ho Chi Minh is the outlier here. It's difficult to say what he would have been like as a peacetime ruler since he never got the chance. One thing worth reading is the Vietnamese declaration of independence (from France) see here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proclamation_of_Independence_of_the_Democratic_Republic_of_Vietnam . Ask yourself whether, had the Cold War not been going on, would America have gotten involved.\n\nAs for your final point, I am not committed to being left, I am committed to whatever improves the lives of humans across the planet. It just so happens that, on the whole, this aligns with the left much more often than the right (at least to the best of my understanding). However this video was about debunking the idea that Hitler was a socialist when, by any sensible definition, Hitler was right wing. That's why the language of left and right is being used.",

        "text": "Perdify - first, thanks for your answer.  It's nice being able to go back and forth with someone who isn't just a pure troll. \n\nWith regards to freedom of speech, it's absolutely true the greatest threat to it today is the progressive left (Bill Maher will confirm this for you, he is far from a right winger).  No, I don't think anyone has the right to a platform.  Twitter, Facebook, Google, Et Al. are private platforms and are offering you a service based on their own terms and conditions.  If you don't follow their conditions they have every right to remove you from their platform.  That's not speech suppression that is called a business operating in a free market with a right to their private intellectual property (like the old signs use to say \"no shoes, no shirt, no service\").  Which is the beauty of having something like the internet operating in a (mostly) free market.  People who get deplatformed have every opportunity to, right now at least, create their own platform and give them a place for their voice to be heard.  It may not be as easy as creating a Facebook page or a Youtube account but the opportunity is still there.  Which is also why the economics of the left (socialism, then communism) are rather frightening.  I'm sure that point could turn into a whole nother debate though....   \n\nSuppression of platform is not what I'm talking about at all.  Universities that do open their stages up for \"right wing\" speakers frequently have students coming to the event who shout down speakers mid speech (Dave Rubin at University of  New Hampshire is a good recent example of this) (Side note, typically a university in the US that does host a \"right wing\" speaker typically has a student group paying the speaking fee.  The only thing the university provides is a space to host the event in.)  You will probably have this group of students chanting at some point \"We're for free speech but this is hate speech\" over the speaker.  Showing up to events and shouting people down because you don't like what they are saying is suppressing free speech.  It's not restricted to Universities either.  There have been multiple incidents just this year where Republican governmental officials and \"right wing\" speakers have been surrounded and shouted at while they are out eating at restaurants or other places where they are just living their lives.  You could say this is just a few unconnected events, except you have Democrat congresswoman Maxine Waters at a rally telling her supporters to surround Republicans when they see then at restaurants and gas stations to shout and intimidate them.  And don't get me started on Milo.  I detest trolls and he is one of the biggest.  If we are going to talk at least have principals and ideals you stand on that we can go back and forth on.  People like Milo have none and just say stuff for the purpose of riling people up.  \n\nOn top of issues above you also get endless speech policing throughout the media.  This has led comedians like Jerry Seinfeld, Chris Rock, and the aforementioned Bill Maher (all hard core \"right wingers\" that group is) to say comedy is going to die because of the \"PC\" culture.  It's not long before people start getting fired because they express a different opinion from the leadership of the company they work for.  Oh wait, I forgot that is already happening.  If you are a religious or political organization, I get it, your ideology is the job so if you have people that aren't on board with your organization's mission they probably shouldn't be there.  But when you are a tech company, you are going to fire people because their political opinions don't line up?  People afraid to talk about their political or religious ideologies because they may lose their job is suppression of speech and that is absolutely happening right now.      \n\n\"but the active suppression of voters by Republicans is not? \"  I know you said you are in the UK so I'm going to put the same answer back on you that you gave to me, check your sources.  Seriously, what are your sources for this?  Where is this happening?  What are Republicans doing exactly to \"suppress voters?\"  Voting is more open and available to anyone in the US now more than anytime in the history of the world.  Seriously, there are government sponsored things such as early voting that happens in the US which is statistically proven to benefit Democrats.  Fact is you can't just spout out \"voter suppression...Republican\" you actually have to back it up, and when you do we can all arrest the people who are perpetrating it.  Until then it is an unfounded scare tactic designed to try to make people think \"left good, right bad\".  \n\n\"Which of those names I gave were not on the \"left\"?\" Most of them\"  - If that's what you think then you are rewriting history brother.  Everyone one of those men where self avowed communists.  Communism is internationally recognized as the far left side of the political spectrum. \n\n\"As for your final point, I am not committed to being left, I am committed to whatever improves the lives of humans across the planet. It just so happens that, on the whole, this aligns with the left much more often than the right\"  I'm with you on the principle, not so much on the execution friend.  I think we have the benefit of history to see how the traditional left/right positions on economics play out in people's lives.  Move more and more to the left and you end up with less free speech, less choices, less individual freedom (see Russia, China, North Korea for extreme examples).   Frankly, I don't think anyone should shack up with either ideological side (contrary to what you probably think about me after this discussion, I don't) but I think your starry eyed view of leftist ideology betrays what I think your honest desires are.  Ultimately that is where the heart of this discussion lies for me and how we ended up here from where we started.  \n\nHitler may have not been a true socialist and the communists of Europe at the time may have been his enemies but the fruits of communism are the same as facism, the wrapper just looks different.  \"Facism-right to communism-left\" is a false equivalency and Hitler had a lot more in common with the communists who shaped eastern Europe for nearly a century than he does with a \"constitutional conservative\" in the US.",
