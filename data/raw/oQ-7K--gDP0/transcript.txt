so my co-editor carlos and i hold a view that might be just slightly unpopular um among american socialist circles and that is that america isn't that bad just kidding it's that there are two americas right there's the bourgeois america that is that bad that is incredibly exploitative incredibly imperialistic um oftentimes racist and then you have the other end which is the masses the working the working people of america and the people who have struggled to make america better right those who struggled in order to get gay marriage legalized uh those who struggled in the labor movement in the in the 20th century those who struggled to fight against slavery in the civil war and abolish slavery in our country there's another side of america that's always fought to move the country forward to something better eventually towards socialism and that's kind of what michael parente is going to talk about here he's going to talk about the freedoms that we have in america and how these weren't given to us right they want you to to be uh grateful thank you so much america for giving us these freedoms thank you to the ruling class but really what this was um anytime you look at a freedom that we have like women's suffrage or you know protections for workers these are things that were fought for by oftentimes organized labor or just activists so let's watch this parenting clip and then we'll talk about it a little more and i don't think everything in america is bad i think the struggles and the freedoms that we have fought for and have tried to maintain which allow us to talk right here now without the goon squads coming in as they would have done 100 years ago in this country if you had this kind of conversation the constable probably would have locked that door or the president of the university would have thrown us all out not allowed the speech to go on i think those are freedoms which we have won and that's not something my country gave me that some mystical entity called my country that gave me those freedoms those freedoms were won through democratic struggle through agitation through demonstration through the right to have the vote women were never given the vote women had to fight for a hundred years and demonstrate get garbage thrown at him and spit on and arrested and thrown into jail some of them died of pneumonia force-fed in prison they thought they had to forcibly extract that democratic right man parenti is just the goat isn't he i love listening to that dude talk about literally anything obviously is geopolitical analysis is the best but it's interesting there to hear him talk about domestic politics and how even though america is such an unequal racist imperialistic country um the good things that we do have have been fought for have been struggled for which is marx's original thesis right that the existing society um and and the the gains that the working masses have made come through struggle through class struggle um so a lot one example that i like to think of that came after parenti's time when he was mostly out doing his thing was when obama legalized gay marriage a lot of people don't know this when obama and biden got elected in 2008 they were not pro pro gay marriage i remember this i was growing up um and uh in a place where a lot of people were not in favor of gay marriage it was not as popular as as it became and through the struggle of people on the ground right through lgbtq plus people going out in the streets and demanding that they be given equal rights you know they'd be given the right to marry each other which gives you uh tax benefits and and there's various legal things other you know regardless of the fact that it's just bigoted to say that two people can't love each other that the government's gonna stop people from doing that and expressing that publicly um and they had to fight for it and eventually they moved obama there and if you look at the news on this there's all this coverage about obama's evolution you know what a great man he started out as a bigot and then after uh protests in the streets among people just wanting equal rights he evolved you know it wasn't that he evolved it was that he saw the base of the democratic party moving that way and people were demanding that they stopped be being treated like their sub-human because of their sexuality and they forced obama and biden there they forced obama and biden to give us gay marriage right the the ruling class wants us to to look at it like thank you obama and biden for this great thing you did bringing us equality no equality needs to be fought for it needs to be extracted from these people um i can't remember the exact uh language that parenti uses but basically extracted um from the ruling class and you can look back in history everything that we have every protection that we have now has been fought for essentially things like child labor you know there was child labor until people organized and got these laws making child labor illegal making overtime pay a thing making it so you can't just work people to death with no protections you know there are certain government regulations now obviously we want worker ownership because that's the ultimate protection um for workers but every single protection that exists in our current liberal democracy is something that has been fought for by the masses and this is marx's thesis right that things are fought for through class struggle and people challenge this idea you know and there's various ways you could challenge it but essentially um essentially it's true right like most the protections we have have been earned through class struggle and and the current system that we have has come about through class struggle and the path forward to socialism and to more worker protections is through class struggle is through organizing the masses um and and that's how everything has been fought and fought and earned as i said um and you have two polls here right the dynamic is you have the bourgeoisie and then you have the masses whether it be lump and proletariat or the actual proletariat um and and we have midwestern marks hold a view that the productive working class agricultural and industrial workers hold a special place in the economy because their labor is so vital to the way that society functions so if you're able to organize these sectors they hold more power over the economy but we want to organize everyone who works right the entirety of the masses people who want to struggle and take society forward but people who also recognize the enemy are those who own right the koch brothers and the political elites that the democratic party are not your friend right they are also a part of the ruined class and and we need to uh wage a struggle against all the evils of the ruling class evils that are imperialism um the racist prison industrial complex that tons of private companies are profiting off of um the exploitation of all our workers um which right now um our economy is shifting towards a gig economy there's more owner operators what we would call scabs right rather than unionized labor you have the these private contractors and this makes it really really difficult to organize the most important sectors of the economy and this is intentional by the ruling class and it's important to recognize these things in our struggle against the ruling class and and find ways to organize ourselves and recognize that things will not be given things need to be fought for there is an enemy right um just by their place in the economy um within capitalism uh the ruling class is gonna do all these evils imperialism lock people up to make money um uh move the economy towards a gig economy so they don't have to pay their workers jack you know um that is the enemy and that is who we need to wage our struggle against all right thanks for watching that parenting video with me everyone i'll see you later [Music] so [Music] you
