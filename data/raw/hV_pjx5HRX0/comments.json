Workers were most united and saw the most victories when Communists upheld the full dignity of national self-determination and liberation of oppressed peoples. Revisionists like Winston, from a position of weakness, did our movement a disservice, by attacking black radicals that King refused to attack. Haywood who was repressed by the revisionists wasn't a force of disunity but laid the understanding that was required to facilitate unity.",
