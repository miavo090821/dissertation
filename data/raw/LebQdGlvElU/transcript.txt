though we finally made it through all the super chats you ready to do this infographics video for a bit Carlos we're not going to watch the whole thing it's like 20 minutes but oh Lord you ready to do some debunking yeah let's do it let's do it thank you everybody we will get to Super chats um either if you send us any super chats while we are talking about this um we'll get to them as soon as possible um appreciate all the people who have sent them already but I saw this video recently I know some of my videos debunking the infographic show have been some of our most viral on the channel um the infographic show is one of these giant YouTube History Channels that's just pure liberal propaganda some of these channels are have direct connections to the US government the Ned um various NOS I don't know about the infographics uh channel in specific but this video was the one that they posted before Russia launched the special military operation in Ukraine um predicting what will actually happen if Russia invades Ukraine so I figured we could dismantle their usual historical revisionism and lies but then also U make an assessment of the uh predictions that they made here now that we're two years deep into the Smo but um uh yeah yeah we won't watch the whole thing but should be fun 100,000 troops stand ready on Ukraine's border with Russia thousands more reservists have been called up to active duty diplomatic talks with the US and NATO have broken down is Russia really about to invade Ukraine and what will happen if it does in 2014 despite publicly denying it Russia invaded and seized Crimea formerly recognized untrue over 90% of people in Crimea wanted to be Russian they wanted to be Russian in 1990 but they were forced to become part of Ukraine PE the people of Crimea have always uh been Associated more with Russia they've always wanted to be Russian and they voted in 2014 to be Russian and there's no mention here of the main event that happened in 2014 which was of course the US and Ned's coup um where they were funneling support into fascistic right-wing elements who escalated the Euro maidon protest that us politicians were openly supporting and making appearances at to rev up the protesters and keep them going um and the fascist elements that they funded and armed were able to escalate these into a violent coup that overthrow overthrew the Ukrainian government put in power NATO puppet government that proceeded to add um openly Neo-Nazi groups like The aav Battalion to Ukraine's actual military which would be like us adding the KKK to our military in the United States these forces led by the fascist but the Ukrainian military in general began a war against the ethnic Russians in the donbass um who you know with very minor help from Russia were able to organize themselves into a a self-defense force a fighting force against that many of their homes were destroyed uh we know we have tons of friends who have spent tons of time in the dabass and met with people there who are very hopeful and very determined but traumatized their their lives have been thrown into chaos by War not the war that Russia started but the war that NATO and the Ukrainian fascist Kiev regime started in 2014 yeah absolutely I mean for these people history doesn't exist it's just these isolated facts that fit into their narrative um they have no awareness or presentation of all the things that you said which are factually true which even the Western media right which for them can't be spun as Putin propagandist they admitted all of this at the time a vast majority of them realized that hey Ukraine has what they called a Nazi problem there was basically a Hitler Youth uh that still exists where kids were sent to be propagandized into this mythical history um that aligns with the Ukrainian na perspective but that's how these people think propaganda isn't always about explicit lies such as what he said there it's also uh and perhaps more importantly about what's not said um and that's something we always have to track you know not only what are the things that they're saying that are not true but how many things are being left out in order so that the untruths that they say actually fit into a you know uh a a a lie based but coherent from that perspective narrative absolutely as Ukrainian territory by the International Community per Russia's narrative the Crimean conflict was a domestically inspired revolutionary Movement by ethnic Russians seeking to rejoin Russia however it very quickly became clear that this was a lie as Russian Special Forces who earned the moner little green men for their featureless uniforms were confirmed to be working with Crimean Rebels then deep dives into Russian social media produced even more damning evidence of regular Russian oh no they helped the people of Crimea who 90% of them wanted to be Russian those damn imperialists soldiers operating inside of Ukrainian territory itself Russia never formally admitted to utilizing both unconventional and conventional military forces in Crimea to fight off Ukrainian forces and in the end Crimea declared itself independent and was quickly absorbed by Russia since then fighting against Rebel forces has continued oh what's that it declared itself independent that's weird cuz you just said that Russia militarily occupied them and forced them to become part of Russia so that's crazy that did that themselves and that's a a fact so you're forced to admit it across disputed Ukrainian territory and Russia has continued to support those Rebel forces albeit in a slightly less obvious way now the fear of a full-scale Russian invasion of Ukraine seems more real than ever as 100,000 Russian soldiers Mass on the border with the Breakaway former Soviet Republic but why would Russia with an invasion of this is turning the world on its head so badly every specialist has been able to demonstrate how it's actually the opposite on the uh Eve of the beginning of the special military operation what happens is that Ukrainian forces prepare for an unprecedented level of attack on the donbass region and it's that which creates the impetus for the need of Russia to enter and what Russia was doing was not preparing for an invasion they just had their troops on the border had that operation happened they would have been able to go in as uh as as readily as possible and it was in a preventive manner to prevent it from happening that they go in because it would have been literally ethnically Russian people getting massacred at a scale much higher than the 14,000 that had already been killed for the last previous eight years yes yeah I couldn't agree more that's a good point and all they're doing here is just uh not telling that part and uh only telling the the Russian side of the story in the most manipulated way possible and selective way possible which you know the CIA wrote this in their handbook that the best way to lie is not to fabricate facts but to selectively choose facts to the point where the narrative that you're spinning is complete [ __ ] and what do you think when you hear the word rebel right if you're thinking about a population and you hear the term Rebel what comes to your mind is like small groups that terrorize everyone else so when they paint what Russia did as just backing up rebels in crime or in donbas what they're doing is ignoring the fact that there was literally a vote in Crimea and 99% if I recall correctly the number voted in favor of being a part of Russia and this vote was legitimized as as Democratic by various International institutions and then with donbass who was it that asked donbass to be a part of Russia was it Russia that asked him hey guys come here join leave Ukraine Ukraine bad no it was donbass itself that since 2014 declared independence and asked for Russian inter intervention to protect them and the party that has been at the front lines of urging Russian intervention has been the Communist Party of the Russian Federation the most Progressive for in Russia and the the former Communist Party of Ukraine who all of them basically had to flee because of how intense the fascistic state repression was in Ukraine absolutely good point bordering Nation could it really do it and what would the world's response be if it did since the end of the Cold War Russia has largely been in Retreat from its former Soviet Glory it's a massive losses of territory and subsequent economic outflow from the independence of numerous former Soviet republics as the nation struggled through tumultuous post-soviet Union years many of these newly independent nations took the opportunity to ensure their own Survival and independence by drawing closer ties with the West Russia made it very clear that it did not want NATO to expand further east than Germany and yet can you pause that real quick just two second comment tumultuous posts Soviet years Oh you mean the shock therapy that killed millions and was imposed by the West that's a funny way to describe it the tumultuous posts Soviet years you mean the [ __ ] decade where millions of people died and the living standard reduced drastically prostitution ran rampant Mafia groups ran rampant oligarchs went ran rampant you mean that period that you created that the US and NATO and and these imperialist parasites created that's the tumultuous Uh Russian decline come on man and I wonder if they'll tell you know the the the story of Russia's recovery under Putin I mean partial recovery they're not haven't returned yet to the the former glory of the Soviet Union but the reason Putin's so popular is because he's managed to stabilize their economy by cracking down on the oligarchs and reinvesting some of the Russian Surplus into things like Russian industry join NATO's ranks pushing NATO forces closer and closer to Russian territory eventually NATO would stand on Russia's northern border with NATO forces within 500 m of Moscow itself for a nation with as difficult a history as Russia this was the sum of all fears and a strategic disaster rarely ever The Invader Russia itself has been repeatedly invaded throughout its history at each time the human and economic toll was profound many of these invasions threatened the very Independence of the nation itself such as ger isn't that interesting that they slipped that fact in there that Russia's almost always been invaded throughout their history right they've had a far more peaceful history other than when they were you know even I guess even under the Zar they were uh one of the weaker Imperial imperialist Powers um but like um historically at least in in modern history in this Century in the last there have been very few invasions launched by Russia unless there were literal fascists at their border that's pretty much the only Russian invasions where you think of the the invasion of Finland or whatever it's been or you know they're marching to Berlin it's been when there are literal craz Nazis at their border that Russia has done a military operation and you know even infographics has to admit that so if Russia has been more peaceful than the US throughout their entire history are we really to believe that now they're the imperialists and the US are the ones prevent up upholding democracy like I literally hear Marxist saying this people who call themselves marxists and it's like I what world are you living in they just live in this world where Russia bad now Russia's capitalist now they are bad they're run by oligarchs everything they do is evil imperialism it's like the legacy of the Soviet Union didn't leave right the the um this is still the Russian people who have you know very rarely aggressively invaded anybody Germany's near defeat of the Red Army in World War II and Napoleon's invasion during the Napoleonic Wars these invasions are so threatening because Russia sits at the Eastern edge of the European plane a large swath of relatively flat land that's very difficult to defend with modern fast-moving military formations this strategic deficiency only increased and after World War II the Soviet Union became obsessed with pushing any potential future aggressor as far west as possible led the Soviet Union to extend its sphere of influence as far west as Germany creating the infamous Soviet block as a buffer zone to any future Invasion with the collapse of the Soviet Union and the Eastern block Russia's influence receded practically back to its own borders and all the Strategic gains of the last 50 years evaporated overnight today more Eastern European nations have chosen to draw closer to the US and its European allies than to Russia mostly due to Russia's authoritarian system of government and fears of becoming puppet States once more as the New Millennium dawned Ukraine began to seek a pathway for membership in NATO and Russia warned that this would be T amount to a declaration of war between itself and NATO not willing to antagonize Russia NATO postponed the Ukrainian question indefinitely despite building Cooperative ties with the nation in 24 Cooperative ties what is cooperative ties mean well they were training Ukrainian troops to be NATO interoperable meaning they can do joint military operations with NATO so the US was basically saying yeah yeah yeah we won't add Ukraine to Nato we'll just station NATO troops in Ukraine and make uh Ukraine's military part of NATO will make them NATO interoperable so all but adding Ukraine to Nato you know without saying it officially that's what they mean by some cooperation and and Russia's not supposed to see that as a threat Russia's not supposed to see that as a threat given NATO's history and the fact that nato in 2017 at their Summit said Russia's their number one target going forward when it was NATO that destroyed Libya and uh carpet bombed Yugoslavia and or Serbia and destroyed helped destroy the Yugoslav socialist project 14 Ukraine's worst fears were realized and now its continued Independence is in question by the 100,000 strong Russian forces massing On the Border if Russia invaded though how would Ukraine fa without Western Aid Ukraine has a population roughly a third of the size of Russia and its military is ranked at the number 22 spot according to Global Firepower tocom which ranks World military Powers according to the strength of their militaries their economies and demographics Russia despite slowly slipping out of it still retains the number two spot as the world's second strongest military power and its overmatch with Ukraine is significant Russia's military numers at 850,000 active Personnel versus Ukraine's 200,000 strong military a mismatch of 650,000 in Russia's favor due to the ever growing threat of allout war with Russia both Ukraine and Russia I'm going to skip through some of this CU this is boring statistics we'll see if there's anything else interesting here What story do these numbers tell about a possible Russian invasion firstly while the numberers advantage is decidedly on the Russian side Ukraine wouldn't actually be facing the full force of the Russian military even in a worst case scenario that's because a significant number of those troops are required for security operations elsewhere Russia must still maintain a strong defensive posture along its northern border with NATO and along its Far Eastern flank on the Pacific in order to deter a possible American incursion realistically only about 50% of its western and southern military districts would be freed up for combat operations in Ukraine with some reinforcements from the rest of Russia's three other military districts a probable invasion of UK but what they didn't expect is the dprk coming in like Stone Cold Steve Austin to say guess what you got 8,000 extra troops now and we're ready to go is that's what just happened recently Ukraine would involve between 150,000 to 200,000 troops bringing the number parity much more in line as Ukraine would be free to use most of its forces to combat the Russian invasion with Belarus as Ukraine will draft a bunch of disabled people and teachers and grandf grandparents in order to fight for them so they have more troops than you think it's all right actually I mean all the police officers are already dead um because we already sent them to the front lines but it's all right we got more still being a strong Russian Ally though sorry go ahead caros and this is an incredible it's it's like a real tragedy and I I think there's a lot of people who are pro Smo who kind of lose sight of this like not everyone in Ukraine is in favor of the zinsky regime but irrespective of whether you are or not you're getting drafted you're getting thrown into a front lines often with limited resources there's been parts of this uh War where people have been thrown to the front front lines with weapons that malfunction regularly that are not uh apt for Warfare right there's people being thrown into areas like Bach moot where the average survival time is four hours or was at least that means that the average person going into the fight there is GNA last four hours you know how scary that is as an individual hey go to this place where everyone who has G dies in four hours for a country that maybe you agree with some maybe you voted for zalinski because he presented himself as the peace guy but a lot of people are not like Pro zinsky and are still being thrown into the front lines to die in the meat grinder of War more than half a million have died it's a tremendous catastrophe loss of human life um and it shows that it's if it's bad to be an enemy of us imperialism sometimes maybe it's even worse to be a friend that's how the US treats its friends it throws them in the meat grinder of war no kidding or a proxy especially an outmatched proxy we'll go just a little bit longer here with this video we don't have to get too deep into it obviously this is pure idiocy but it'll be good to have a debunk of this video available on YouTube for anybody who happens to come across it a significant number of Ukrainian forces must be left in reserve in case of an unexpected Northern incursion so even Ukraine can't commit its entire force to the fight Russian reinforcements would also need to make a lengthy trip from training camps or other military districts to Ukraine while Ukraine would be drawing up Res service just miles from the fighting it's so true that's what we always say what that comment uh is what we always say when we're reviewing infographics videos like imagine if we had this money all of their views come from the nice like easy to understand visuals they under their grasp of history and the facts is twoyear olds in a Russian invasion of Ukraine Russia would not enjoy a vast number superiority that the raw data shows even if as Russia believes portions of Ukrainian populations would join them in a bid to rejoin Russia a dubious proposition indeed in the air even only well that's what happened with the people in the donbass they joined Russia and Russia did have an overwhelming amount of troops and now countries like the dprk and the emerging multi-polar world are coming to their AIDS so it it's really just uh really what this is is uh to trick westerners into supporting the war by saying actually Ukraine has a chance there's more troops than you think uh we can draft uh um disabled people so there's actually more than you think we we should support this war it's just a pure propaganda piece and it's subtle it's more subtle propaganda but it that's what's so dangerous about it is it's presented as objective um and it's it's so clearly not to any anybody who has a full picture of the the events liing 30 to 40% of its Air Forces Russia would still dominate the skies Ukraine operates largely Cold War era aircraft which are being kept operational by a domestic arms industry while Russia's inventory is largely modern though not entirely so Russia's overmatch in the skies would allow it to establish Complete Air superiority and its extensive groundbased air defense batteries would allow it to threaten over half of Ukraine from the ground without even moving air defense units inside Ukraine's borders thus Ukraine would that part's actually been uh true and that's been Russia's sort of prolonged protracted war strategy just fire from a distance take minimal casualties um grind Ukraine down grind down the US and NATO and the West's arms uh Armament Supply it's worked would likely op to it's generally Russian military strategy and this is what people like Scott Ritter who've studied how Russia was able to beat Napoleon and how Russia was able to beat the Nazis it's a strategy that's very similar you know Claw at them bit by bit until they're done absolutely the Russians know how to fight I've never wrestled the Russian wrestler who didn't kick my ass to be honest with you usually the ones who travel to America are pretty damn good I'm sure there's a lot of Russian wrestlers I could be but they know how to fight all super chats will be read as soon as we're done with the reaction to this yeah yeah sorry sorry we'll be done real soon and we'll get to your super chats Ukraine's Eastern front as Russian ew units jammed Ukrainian Communications and even spoofed text messages to soldiers on the front lines with demoralizing or confusing orders for the most part Ukraine has no such capability however while the numbers heavily favor Russia a conquest of Ukraine would by no means be easy for them for starters Ukraine enjoys HomeField advantage and after eight years of hostilities with Russia pro- independent sentiments are strong amongst the Ukrainian population dreams of being pro independent sentiments Pro Stefan Bandera sentiments are really strong in West Ukraine pro- Neo-Nazi sentiments are strong because of the cia's operation whatever it was called that's been backing Ukrainian ethn nationalists since the end of World War II they don't mention that though why would you mention that that doesn't have anything to do with anything why would you mention that the US has been propping these people up since the end of World War II and that's open knowledge why would anybody need to know that facts are a stubborn thing infographics they're Heroes though they get standing ovations and in the houses of governments in China and China Jesus Christ in yeah don't say that gave us a really based neighbor godamn um in Canada and uh in the US as well it's um it's disgusting yeah brother versus brother as Cactus Paris says absolutely these countries were both part of the the Soviet Union that's what the people in East Ukraine are saying they're the ones with rational heads on their shoulders they're saying why are we going to fight with our brothers why are we going to fight with these people who are literally the same people as us you know who like literally gave us our sovereignty and and said yes you can have your Ukrainian nation which you know maybe that was a mistak frontation with Russia the CIA has also joined the conflict its secretive special activities division has been training Ukrainian forces and Guerilla Warfare tactics for years and helping prepare the nation for a possible Invasion the cia's sad has been preparing Ukrainian active duty and Reserve forces to wage an unconventional war against Russia's Superior military inor Lessons Learned From so they started the video talking about how Russians were so deeply involved in the donbass even though their involvement in the donbass was extremely minor it was mostly you know just the Donetsk and lugans um Communists organizing themselves with very minor help from um certain forces in Russia most of them being communist aligned forces by the way for all the American Communists who condemn this um but they were very minorly involved the CIA was deeply involved but look we're 14 minutes into the video before infographic says that before infographics says guess what the CIA was in Ukraine doing [ __ ] and you know obviously they were probably involved with the 2014 overthrow of the government they were training up troops they were training up ukrainians arming Ukrainian fascists but let's not mention that let's just say that uh that Russia's doing it it's it's so one-sided it's so obvious how they lie guys there was a peace records it was the Minsk agreements uh and the the chancellor of Germany whose name I'm forgetting do you remember her name Angela merel Angela Merkel Angela Merkel came out and basically admitted that the only reason why they signed those Accords was not to actually seek peace which was with Russia was actually seeking but in order to buy time to be able to train and uh prepare Ukraine to wage what they've wanted Ukraine to do the whole time which is a proxy war against Russia their ends are clear they've been wanting Russia to be balcon for a very very long time absolutely what's so funny about Germany is they have the German guilt Pride where they have this like competition to see who can be the most guilty about the Nazis but like Nazism really never left Germany um let's be real one more one more little clip here then we'll then we'll move on to the super chats Vietnam and both the US's and Russia's invasion of Afghanistan so what would a Russian invasion of Ukraine look like and what might happen Russia's main thrust into Ukraine would come from a they're about to send me on a rant about the Soviet uh invasion of Afghanistan they were building hospitals and schools and helping the Democratic Marxist government to fend off the CIA funded jihadists who were throwing asset in the faces of women because they were learning how to read gar border with an intense air campaign lasting two or more days destroying any Ukrainian air opposition and targeting command and control nodes troop staging areas Supply hubs and Industrial sectors in a mirror to the US own strategy of shock and awe the intent would be a Swift and incomprehensibly violent campaign meant to Blind the Ukrainian military throw it into disarray by disrupting Communications and seriously demoralize it through extensive bombing groundbased missiles would supplement air operations allowing Russian missile units deep inside its own territory to lay forces and severely slow their rate of Advance at this point Ukraine's goal would be to slow the pace of the war as much as possible in Hope of an international response and resolution as it could never part kind of true as well they basically just tried to hold off Russia and uh uh get NATO involved like that's the thing like zilinski is basically a cornered rat at this point and the only way for him to save himself is for NATO to get involved which of course means World War I so they've put him in the position where the only way to save himself is um assuming Russia's going to depose him which we still don't know uh that's something that we've been debating on this account on on at The Institute and and on uh our streams for like a year or now whether not they're actually over a year probably whether or not they're actually going to topple zinsky but really the only way for him to win at this point is to uh create World War II so that's the kind of dangerous dangerous situation that the US Empire has put the world in yeah and it's so unnecessary it doesn't benefit the American people it doesn't benefit the people in Europe that are lock step following America's agenda to wage a proxy war against Russia it certainly doesn't benefit the Ukraine Ians half a million of them that have been thrown into to die for literally no [ __ ] reason and it doesn't it doesn't benefit anyone the only people that uh it purports to in reality benefit are the Elite of the West and the people that benefit from more but even them the imperialists are kind of losing the strangle hold that they had on the world even PR Smo yeah um especially through financial institutions it's spent it it's it sort of sent uh uh the world into a process of dollarization uh quicker than what was already happening because who the hell is going to trust a currency that acts in the ways it acted against Russia uh so quickly and and and did everything it's it's done to Russia who's going to trust them you know what if they end up on the bad side of the US and with a bunch of dollars like what you know so um it's literally not even benefiting the interest of the imperialist themselves and this is what Putin said in the interview with uh Tucker Carlson like you guys do you guys realize that you're shooting yourself in the foot in every way possible like there's not one thing positive coming from this not one but they're still doing it crazy the only people who really benefit are the weapons makers that's it the military industrial complex it's the only thing I can think of the the European industrialist losing out maybe the American energy companies who are now selling their [ __ ] to Ukraine because the nordstream pipeline was blown up or like it's it's really just a few minor Financial interests in the US but overall it's it's horrible for Europe and horrible for the vast majority of the United States to the point where you even have Trump you know now calling out the the proxy war and and saying that Ukraine's a corrupt government that we shouldn't be giving money to but u i mean most of the most of the old going into Europe where's it coming from is it coming from any different Source than it was free sanctions on Russia no it's the same Source it's just mediated through India and hiked in order for the middleman to make a profit so they're paying a lot more for the same thing that they were getting a lot cheaper before so there was a there was a meme that I forget who posted it um but it was like it was three people it was someone spitting something through a a straw into someone else's mouth and then that other person you know uh shoving the liquid into another person's mouth with the straw and that's basically Russia to India and then India selling selling it back to Europe and it's it's ridiculous it's so true
