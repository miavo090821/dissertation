In fact, moustache dude crushed the socialists/communists of the Marxist variety in Germany. ANTIFA is a Bolshevik organization. They oppose the right wing ultranationalist ideologies in Western Europe, NS being on of them, itself being a variation of Mussolini's Fascism. These ideologies re-worked Marxist ideas beyond recognition. Fascism's idea is to embody every aspect of life in the state, especially in the merger of corporate power with the state. This isn't what Marxist socialism is.\n\nHere's a pro-tip. In the future, specify what you mean by political terms like \"socialism\".

If we were pushing this to our logical extremes anyone of Italian or German descent shouldn't run the country due to their ancestors involvements in the rise of fascism as an ideology, or anyone of Russian descent due to only becoming a 'free' country 34 years ago. Judging anyone off of their race or background is stupid, and is a major reason why Trump won in 2016, because the Dems had their heads up theirs and could only come up with 'Trump bad.'",

The problem with capitalism isn't the game, but the players. The people who win at it most tend to be greedier and greedier and refuse to accept any sort of market pressures, so long as they can afford to. And they can afford to because wealth inequality is only worsening. They have SO MUCH excess money that they can literally just sit on real estate in perpetuity without renting it and being exposed to market forces.

Certainly in refusing political candidates who openly espouse it, but also in all policies. Revoke SSA (pay out only what was paid in, to those who paid it, at the moment of shutdown and then close it). Revoke income limits to deductions for medical expenses and mortgage insurance, etc. Yank the federal govt out of education, airlines, housing, banking, mortgages, healthcare, insurance... none of those got better. Get rid of the Fed Reserve, the IRS, income tax, and the bloated welfare and intelligence agencies (military intelligence is what it used to be, and they had far more accountability to the citizens to face). And withdraw from any groups like the UN that make the US subject to foreign oversight (aka global authoritarians).\n\nStart by refusing any candidates who are openly socialist, shut down any org that is, and put govt back to the levels of 1870-1912, when we built the majority of the country's infrastructure and industry using tariffs and private businesses, small medium and large.",

It's far easier than you think, much like closing the border, deportations, and getting ceasefire agreements (even if they have to be remade). It's why the left hates him so much, he's showing the whole world how easily things the left said 'couldn't be done' actually can be when you _want_ to.
