So yes, torture works, just no better than a shotgun or machine gun. The reason we stopped torturing enemy soldiers isn’t because you cannot get good information that way, but that  we don’t want our own soldiers tortured, so it is a mutual agreement not to do so. However terrorists don’t give us that courtesy, so that  line of reasoning is goes out the window \nYes it has been used to get fake confessions an awful lot so that actually is an unassailable point. \nThis may very quickly become an obsolete controversy even if i’m right because MIT is fast taking us to an age of mind reading machines, that would allow us to directly extract information from a captured terrorist’s brain without the uncertainties involved in torture .",

I'd only like to add that far-reaching structural changes (political, societal and especially economic) would probably benefit the Afro-American community a lot more than reparations. Reparations might be a viable step towards making such changes possible, however, by empowering the black community. Might also cause even worse racist resentments and might make political change a more violent process. I don't know, it's difficult. Have a good one.",

If we used our full scientific and technological potential in order to make money obsolete and maximize global human and ecological well-being freeing people up to new levels of education, cooperation, open-source knowledge, innovation and self-fulfillment. That is my personal, ultimate dream vision. So, my main issue with reparations is that they are made out of money and would only take place in a society which hasn't abolished it. Consequenetly I know that whenever that would even happen, it would be just one temporary battle won. Sorry for the stream of consciousness I had going on there :D",

It's easier to ditch a single minority only program than something that positively affects the wider voter base.

I am sorry I made you put a lot of thought into an answer that wasn't directly required in this case, because I agree.\n\n\nI was not trying to frame any of this as a reason to avoid reparations. First, I mentioned the risks which came to my mind because risk assessment just seems reasonable to me, if only to be prepared.\nSecondly, my lofty goals will probably not come true during my lifetime and I was not trying to advocate for inaction in the meantime. I was probably just rambling on about, essentially why the thought of reparations just doesn't seem like an actual solution to me, rather a stepping stone towards an actual solution. Not, that it shouldn't be done.\nNothing gives people agency like money, as long as we make it our central paradigm. So give it to a huge group of people who, yes, have been systematically and purposefully disadvantaged, abused, exploited and generally oppressed.\nI do not disagree with you, I was just unsuccessfully trying to add a few additional aspects to the conversation. English isn't my first language, so I'm not always certain if I am getting my mesage across correctly and I'm actually thankful you made me aware of my failure to do so this time. No hard feelings on my part, I hope it's the same way for you.",

Under the Constitution everyone, even killers and robbers and \"thugs\" are entitled to a trial by a jury of their peers before the government can visit punishment or penalty on them...  Unless of course the media can somehow excuse the times the State just ignores that boundary on its power because the deceased \"was no angel.\"\nEdit:  Credit where it is due to the State for holding those in its employ to account in this particular case.

A second (somewhat complementary) angle to Tucker doing his thing (which ultimately lends itself to pursuing the same goals, ofc) is it being part of a conscious \"diversification\" in programming on the part of his employer. This will essentialy allow for an easier future pivot of F*cks News as a whole in case Tucker's nationalist/isolationist flavor of white supremacy does indeed become a dominant right-wing position. One should also be wary of a subtle introduction of eco-fascist ideas, which can (and will) be made more palatable in a very similar fashion, i.e. by carefully moving away from the traditional one-dimensional, pro-capitalist narrative. Obviously, this will - for the most part - be pretty much indistinguishable from whatever fascist propaganda outlets are bound to do anyway, but it's also currently the most prudent strategy when considered purely in terms of capitalist incentives.",

        "text": "@gyro4250 \"the false narrative behind the chemical attacks in douma.\" - Russian Assadist propaganda. More importantly, an unsupported claim.\n\neaworldview dot com - Solving a Mystery: The Deadly Chemical Attack on Syria’s Douma and a New Document\n\n\nPosted by Scott Lucas | Jun 12, 2019\n\n\n\"Henderson’s summary claims to challenges the official report. He claims that he could not model a scenario where the cylinder that caused the Douma fatalities did not break through the building roof, if it was dropped by a helicopter or other aircraft. Henderson makes the same claim for the second cylinder, even though it did penetrate into the building.\n\n\"Henderson asserts that 'the alternative hypothesis' provides the only explanation for both cylinders. Without providing any evidence, he asserts, 'There is a higher probability that both cylinders were manually placed at those two locations rather than being delivered by aircraft.'\n\n\"Henderson does not venture to explain why dozens of people were killed, if a cylinder was simply placed in a roof or in a bedroom. Alternatively, he does not explain why he goes beyond the mandate of the OPCW Fact Finding Mission: as it cannot assign blame, the report only considers if a chemical weapons was used and not — as in the focus of Henderson’s dissent — the method of delivery.\n\n\"Henderson’s challenge is complicated by the channel for his document, the 'Working Group on Syria, Propaganda and Media'.\n\n\n\"The Group was formed in 2017 by UK-based academics including Piers Robinson, Tim Hayward, David Miller, and Paul McKeigue. None has expertise regarding Syria or chemical weapons, but they have devoted much of their work to denying the Assad regime’s responsibility in any attacks...\n\n\n\"The Group does not confine itself to a summary of Henderson’s document. Instead, it spirals into a repetition of its conspiracy theories.\n\n\n\"'The staging of the Douma incident entailed mass murder of at least 35 civilians to provide the bodies,' the Group asserts with no evidence, blaming White Helmets rescuers for the killings.\n\n\"The Group then turns its fire on the OPCW: '[Those] who have suppressed the evidence of staging are, unwittingly or otherwise, colluding with mass murder.'\"\n\nTry to be more skeptical.",

In the case of value, it's not just psychologically constructed either, but socially constructed as well.\n\n\nAlso 'inherent' really shouldn't be used in that case. It carries a lot of baggage. It logically means that property is something essential, where if it didn't have that property, it would be something else entirely. Which really makes no sense with a concept like value. A 'thing' is still a 'thing' whether it has value or not.

I don't consider that ideology valid, don't know about you. Validity is a measure of meeting criteria, and that ideology doesn't meet my selected criteria.\n\n\nBelieving in a universally fixed morality ironically gives more space for bad ideology. Because instead of having to justify themselves by being open about their ideology and axioms, they bend and twist things behind the scenes to get do whatever it is they want (most of the time they do it subconsciously). We've had a fixed absolutist idea of morality for so long, and yet we know it doesn't work. People do whatever anyway, while believing themselves to be guided by deontological ideals.\n\n\nThe only reason morality has changed for the better over time (lgbtq rights for example) is because people who understand morality and ethics want to make things better and generally know how to. Secular humanism is so much more complicated than your reductionist view. People have reasons for being who they are. Something being subjective doesn't mean it's trivial or simple. \n\n\n\"Everything is arbitrary.\" Uhhhh? Where did you get that from?

Cowering at the idea we are alone in our struggle. That there are no easy answers. That you would crumble if your faith were removed. You are clearly driven by fear, not love.

        "text": "Drinker_Of_ Milk you know what, it actually doesn’t matter how much value you do or don’t ascribe to an embryo or a foetus. It makes no difference whatsoever. \n\nBecause until that embryo or foetus can survive on its own, outside of my body, I get to decide. That’s the entire point. I have the right to remove it from my body, at any point in time, because I have the right to bodily autonomy. Just like I cannot force you to give me blood or an organ, so too must I be allowed the right to decide what I use my body for. \n\nIf the foetus isn’t yet at the point of viability (which is to say, the point at which it can survive outside of the womb), then it’s an abortion, a termination, whatever you wish to call it. If the foetus is at or after the point of viability, then I should be able to access early childbirth- that still gives that foetus the chance to live in its own, and I think that’s a perfectly reasonable compromise. \n\nBecause I don’t care how far along the pregnancy is, I should be able to opt out at any time, for any reason. This is my morality, where the bodily autonomy of people is held above all else. And it’s even more important in a situation like pregnancy, given the risks involved. Pregnancy and childbirth still kills women, even in developed countries. It can (and does, fairly often) result in lifelong injury. Now, most women accept these risks when we choose to continue a pregnancy, but no woman (or any other person capable of carrying a pregnancy) should ever be forced to accept such risks. \n\nTo say otherwise is not only to give foetuses more rights than women, it gives women fewer rights than a corpse. This is not acceptable to me. And you can disagree with me all you like, call me nasty names, whatever. I don’t care. I know my own morality, built upon my environment, but also upon a great amount of research and thought on the subject. I’m also satisfied that my morality is consistent.

Doctors do not need to beautify terms, they just treat conditions of the human body. Abortion means \"dislocate\" and is far less precise than Terminating the pregnancy... IF you need a term that is covering up what happens ABORTION is the one you need to be angry at.\n\n“killing a small child and ripping it apart limb by limb and selling it’s parts for profit”\nAh one of those poeple that have drunk the whole barrel of coolaid... nice. Nothing of that is an appropriate description of your typical pregnancy. 85 or slightly more percent of all pregnancy terminations are CHEMICALLY. YOu take a pill and the body will reject the fetus. And as it is early in the pregnancy and the fetus is microscopic it will be cleansed out in blood and placental remnants not much different from a  period. And no it's not a \"child\", it's the bud that some day MIGHT become a child. Take it out of the womb without harming the fetus and it still will die as it is absolutely unable to survive without the womb and it's support mechanisms.\n\nThe \"selling body parts for profit\" story is a pure myth though. Your BEST attempt at evidence would rely on \"Project Veritas\" a demonstrable troll that has lied and faked \"documentary videos\" for a right wing agendas for the last 10 or 12 years. Incluing the one where he posed as a pimp and asked about government subsidies for a \"business starter\" and the abortion video where he TRIED to get Planned Parenthood to say they sold the aborted tissue for profit and did not succeed. Limited research is conducted on Stemcells, but those also come from miscarriages in hospitals, you know... god's own abortions. which including failures to implant in the placenta make up between 35 and 40 percent of all \"pregnancies\" if you deem that to be everything after fertilization. And as the name says it is research on STEMCELLS. Those are cells in growing fetusses that have the potential to become bascially all organs including skin and bones and for that ability and universal mutability they are researched. Nobody aborts a fetus to make that possible, but if the pregnancy is terminated, what is so horrible about using the rest for the good of humanity, cure illnesses and help humans live longer, healthier livesß\n\nUltimately you probably should read your bible more and start being angry at your PRO ABORTION god... and don't folks like you always rabble on about god has this plan and nothing happens that he doesn't want to happen? SO wtf are you even trying to change? GOD'S MIND?",

For almost all of the states that have stand your ground laws on the books don't allow for people to shoot others simply because they feel threatened. This is flat out bullshit, stand your ground only applies to  personal private property. Namely, that means you can't just shoot someone on the sidewalk simply because you feel threatened, the person whose threatening you has to be doing so while on your private property. Even then it doesn't apply when the person whose been \"threatened\" has an opportunity to remove themselves from the situation (such as leaving, or going into another part of the property and calling the police.) This doesn't apply when outside of one's private property at all, as understandably when one is in public it's very easy to extract oneself from the situation. Even then stand your ground doesn't allow for violence that goes above and beyond what is necessary in order to neutralize the supposed threat. The means your not in the clear if you shoot someone who's got a pocket knife because you feel threatened by the fact that he has a knife. You'd be in the right to shoot someone only when they're in your home and they have equal firepower so to speak and are actively threatening you will that firepower. And lastly, it also doesn't apply when the person you feel threatened by is attempting to extract themselves from the situation. For instance, it would be murder in my home state to shoot a man whose broken into your property if that person attempts to run away when they see you, as they are no longer threatening you or your property but instead are trying to get away from the threatening situation they find themselves in.",

        "text": "@bensimpson570 I wouldn't say that the bible is inherently proslavery, moreso it's pro-authority. The passages of the new testament that mention slavery specifically maintain that God has supposedly put you into such a situation for a reason and to be content with that (from one of Paul's epistles). This also applies to those who own slaves, as God supposedly put them into your power for a reason and as such you must treat them well. I'm not trying to spread slavery apologia by the way. I actually dispise paul's epistles for multiple reasons, not the least of which are these arguments about authority as well as the multiple sidelong insults made against homosexuality as well as an entire epistle dedicated to making the Jews out to be sinful heathens. That being said, as far as the old testament goes slavery is mentioned quite a few times. Namely in the last three books of the Torah (leviticus, Numbers, and Deuteronomy). These legal codes don't apply to Christianity at all, as most people accept the arguments offered in the epistle to the Romans. In this epistle, Paul lays out his arguments as for why Christians need not subject themselves to Jewish canon law. As Christ supposedly died to offer all who believe grace and forgiveness of sins. According to his argument, the law is the item through which people came to know what was sinful, and through knowing that it is forbidden people become subverted by sinful nature and sin even though they wish to live by the law. On top of that, adherence to the laws of the bible are a persons way of measuring earthly \"righteousness\" when compared to others on earth (for instance, you wouldn't be able to say someone's a good person without knowing what makes a bad one) and as such those that live through faith need not apply themselves to what amounts to a dick measuring contest. This is backed up by one part of the book of Genesis: \"Abram believed the word of God, and it was reckoned unto him as righteousness.\" Meaning Abraham's belief in God came before his being morally good by earthly standards. The epistle to the Romans is often why most Christian groups don't care about eating Kosher foods. Jesus also personally addresses the kosher food laws in the book of mark saying: \"Nothing that enters a person by way of their mouth may make them unclean, for this enters the stomach and is expelled into the sewer. But what comes from a person's mouth, truly I tell you, that corrupts completely. For out of the mouth comes all forms of licentiousness, lies, gossip, and intention of murder.\" The epistle to the Romans goes on to say that if one applies even one of the Jewish canon laws to themselves as a Christian, they must apply all laws to themselves. That would mean that if a modern christian wished to own slaves they would have to abide by biblical law around the owning of other people as well as all other laws and strictures, which would be impossible as many of these laws apply to sacrifices that must be made at the temple in jerusalem. Both the books of exodus as well as leviticus have laws surrounding slavery within them. Firstly, in exodus God tells moses that all of the laws of Israel shall apply to all equally saying \"You shall have one law for two peoples, for both you and the residents among you shall share in one law\" and later in leviticus tells moses that nothing that is sold (property that is, including people) shall forever remain in the buyers possession: \"after seven periods of seven years, on that sabbatical year shall be the year of Jubilee. All who have been sold into bondage shall come home and all who have sold property shall receive it and see it returned. Only in the cities of the levites shall they never sell their ancestral holdings as they are given to me to do the service of the lord.\" This also would apply to slaves (at least Jewish slaves) as they would be allowed their freedom in the year of Jubilee. Now, even according to the bible the tribes of Israel never did this (it's a point of contention in the book of kings, King Josiah finds the book of the law and is enraged that his forefathers did not listen to the word of God).",

In which case, anytime a man ejaculates, he commits genocide since he kills millions of lives. It also means that we can consider curtains, chairs, pillows and more to be alive since they have the same properties as a fetus at conception.\n\nThe only difference between a fetus and a parasite is what they could become. They both only survive by sucking nutrients out of the host, they both cannot survive outside of the host for a majority of their time, they both can kill the host if not treated properly, and their host can kill them if not treated properly. The argument that \"already born humans are parasites and therefore can be killed\" is illogical because the humans are already removed from the host and no longer solely need the host to survive. A parasite needs a host to survive, a human does not. While they may need help, they don't need to damage a person by being within them sucking their nutrients to stay alive.\n\nThe science on when the exact moment of life happens is inconsistent, I just wanted to see what you would say when it came to such a question. Since the science is inconsistent and the fetus is more parasite than human, abortion is okay in my book, no matter the time. Even late stage abortions because a majority of the time, doctors only perform a late stage abortion if it's medically necessary.",

You can't treat that (violence) as a commodity because the law of capital accumulation will ultimately undermine the rule of law (if i can purchase enough violence to rival the state why would i obey the law) and why would I even respect private property if the violence that i can exercise overpowers the one that the government uses to guarantee your property rights.\nThis fits in the current US trend of commodifying civil society. Look at the privatization of the penitentiary system and \"Citizens United\" (the commodification of speech) look at how capitalism erodes the bases of liberal society.",

The only notable difference between American fascism and other fascist movements is that America is wholly intolerant of socialism, which means that said fascists use the label of \"capitalist\" instead.

I question the appropriateness of a label for a 20th century political movement as a label for something that goes back further than that.\n\nWith the exception that I would not characterize the US as totalitarian. It has a place on a spectrum toward totalitarianism, but, under your definition, can you think of a single non-totalitarian state in history? And, of course, the totalitarian label applies far better to supposedly Marxist states than to liberal capitalist states. Perhaps we could call the Soviets fascist, but I would find that questionable and worth discussing.\n\nIf \"fascists have no ideology beyond power-grabbing\" why do they tend to use the same political techniques? I do think fascists or near-fascists are particularly likely to try to pass themselves off as something else, but it would be hard to recognize them as fascists if they didn't ultimately show the traits in your first paragraph (\"aligning in opposition to the left, heavy use of symbolism\" etc). If we're not rigorous, we can just label anything we don't like \"fascist\" and use the term as stupidly as the right use \"Marxist\", \"socialist\", and \"communist\".

They're certainly not marxist, marxism is anarchist and is thus incompatible with any large state by definition. It's rather like claiming there's an atheist church or a healthy poison. One precludes the other. Soviet Russia was certainly fascist, and modern Russia is not much better, opting for a capitalist oligarchy.\n\nFascists do what works, based on how previous movements behaved.

As for your false equivalence at the end, I can only hope you learn the meanings of those words if you think any of them can be equated with fascism.",

And I would assume it has as much to do with distancing an officer from the act of possibly killing a person. Last few decades seem to indicate people tend not to want to shoot and kill another person. Which can make it more difficult for a police officer to actually discharge their firearm when required.

He probably wasn't exposed to much diversity as a kid and was filled with christian propaganda so that he simply took his religion for granted while other religions seemed bad and dumb.  Then some people from another religion blew up the world trade center on 9/11 and the christian propagandists leaned in on this.  They probably painted people who weren't white with a broad brush as well, since bigotry all seems to come from the same source of irrational fear of the other.  So he just views all these \"others\" in broad strokes and doesn't bother differentiating them... then he's galvanized to extremism.  And on top of it all he probably has some issues with mental illness that are going completely untreated, which combined with his shitty views lead to well... this.  But yeah, imagining is easy.",

The reality is that these kinds of protests rarely have the intended effect - the road to hell is paved with good intentions.\n\n\nEven on the hardliner side, their regret is not having proper riot equipment.

        "text": "@ducktube7473 I think we have to establish facts here first. First off, most Chinese also remember the events prior to 6/4, including the televised meetings between the student leaders and the politburo. Simply put, they did not show any sign of negotiation or diplomacy - it was more of a roast. You don't take an opportunity like that and turn it into a spectacle for self-satisfaction. That is how it is seen in Chinese culture, whether you agree with it or not. You cannot interpret this in a western culture context because this is not America we are talking about.\n\n\nSecond, facts have to be established here. There is quite widespread agreement among people who actually have studied the events that there weren't tanks rolling over kids or any sort of massed gunning at the square (look at the leaked cables on WikiLeaks and for god's sake avoid the Falun Gong cultists) - it was evacuated peacefully. This makes sense - it's their kids, they don't want to harm them either. If we are talking about Muxidi, everything becomes much more nebulous, but that is far removed from \"tanks rolling over students.\" It is also physically far removed from Tiananmen Square.\n\n\nThird, your anti-Chinese bias is showing hardcore here. Rather than assuming that everyone is brainwashed, perhaps spend some time visiting China and asking around? I assure you, no matter how much the press wants you to think that you know better than them, they are far more aware of their situation than you could ever be. Run this with some simple logic - can you understand the real US without knowing a lick of English?\n\n\nIf you visit China, you know that it is not a place where you can just cite a source. Nothing is set in stone because of the guanxi system and the rapid pace of changes in the country. No one writes shit down like that, at least not without extremely rocky support (think lack of peer review, verification). Perhaps this is bad for historical traditions and records - yes, and that is its own healthy debate, but it works as-is for the culture. What this doesn't mean though is to trust what people outside of the country say about China, especially those who make a living spewing cold war theories out like it's 1970 again.\n\n\n_At the very least_ you should know that it is a topic with a lot of nuance, not \"evil government crushes innocent students who just want freedom and democracy.\"",

And yeah the violene against them is well documented.\nWhere y clain to come from is pretty irrelevant, y try to justify state sanctioned mass murder of its own citizens for wanting more freedom.\nTianamen is soley on the ccps hands. \nThey send in the army with tanks and assault rifles. \nBut I guess seen through the ccps perspective\n Killing their citizens to stay in power is ok.\nIts an age old chinese tradition after all",

Trotsky predicted the collapse of the Soviet Union in the inter-war period and was vindicated decades later. Not to mention the fact that neoliberalization and the so-called catch-up revolutions in Eastern Europe caused an economic collapse and the loss of 30-40% of GDP in Eastern Europe, disillusionment with which is literally the root cause of illiberalism and nationalist jingoism in those regions. It's important to look beyond an uninformed definition of capitalism/communism and read some basic theory before you repeat generic non-perceptive truisms and deepities.",

There was a pretty significant rise in standards in most other places as well. Take for example my home country of Finland, we were in a pretty shitty place after WW2, yet the nation got on pretty well and even payed back the absurd war reparations to the Soviets. We also got one of the most equal and least corrupt societies. This was done with what I guess would be labeled as social democracy, a form of regulated capitalism.\nI also want to bring up China and fascism again though. This is the definition straight from wikipedia:\n\"Fascism  is a form of far-right, authoritarian ultranationalism[1][2] characterized by dictatorial power, forcible suppression of opposition, and strong regimentation of society and of the economy\".\nI think that's pretty spot on on what's going on in China atm. Add to that another definition I've read about fascism, that centers on the state controlling private corporations and their ethinc cleansing of the Uyghurs, I would say there's a strong case to be made that China is right now a far right nation.\nSo now I'm kind of wondering, since most definitions of communism strives after public steering/owning without a state, how would one get to that. How would you get a system safe from the greed and lust for power in human nature. In my head, you need to have some sort of organisation for a society, that's usually called a government. And when you have a government for a society that's in charge of everything, that's really attractive for power grabbers. I really don't see how a system would be shaped that would be immune to take the authoritarian routes of the CCCP and China. Maybe if you had very small separate units so that one person or group could not seize power over all, but then you're pretty much back to having many small states.\nSorry bout the long text, not trying to be obnoxious here, I'm genuinely interested in this discussion.",

And I still don't have a great answer to the claim that capitalism has resulted in more bloodshed than communism.

        "text": "@seanaaron94 If you actually look at the nature of economic development, it becomes increasingly clear that the entire capitalist system sustains itself through unequal material relations and trade relations with periphery countries. The legacy of capitalism isn't some Smithian ideal of \"free markets drive down apple prices for john doe\", it's a legacy of mis-developed periphery countries pursuing extractivist modes of production because they were forced into it by the legacy of colonialism and current economic hegemony of the west. Furthermore, bourgeois economists have already accepted the natural cycles of boom and bust in the capitalist economy predicted by Marx and expounded upon by Marxist thinkers for two centuries. The fact that such crises occur hasn't really, existentially become apparent to you (or indeed most of us). The repeated rise and collapse of economic bubbles, and the slow growth in periphery and semi-periphery countries not only shattered post-Soviet  Fukuyama liberalism but has engendered the rise of illiberal reactionaries like Orban that \"liberals\" purport to fight against. On your point that the left doesn't exist in America, it's not a result of any failure in ideology. Capitalism is more predatory and concentrated than ever; the rise of globalization has merely made exploitation of workers, exploitation of the periphery countries...etc more exigent. Climate change, a direct result of global capitalism's need to expand production for the sake of capital accumulation, threatens our extinction, material scarcity and hegemonic conflicts increase international tensions and push us towards war every day. And as you macho-posture aout mindless violence and people's heads being blown up, the world is pushed toward instability by the very blinding ideology you can't understand any critique of.  Like Professor Terry Eagleton pointedly jokes about liberal ideology, claiming that Marxism is finished and unnecessary is like claiming that firefighting is out of date because arsonists are more dangerous and crafty than ever - poignantly, quite the opposite.",

        "text": "@anotheraccount2576 Ehm... Yes they are. I mean Tucker especially talks about keeping a white majority and aludes to great replacement theory, he used to have an explicitly white supremacist writer for his scrips who bragged about sneaking in white supremacist talking pounts in to the script. A man who tucker outright says he still loves and supports. Tucker is fervelently opposed to BLM, and tries his absolute hardest to demonize the movement and missrepresent the cause, making it so much harder for anything to actually be done. Tucker is one of the most influential people in all of America and he's one of the greatest reasons why people hold racist sentiments that are becoming pretty common place in America.\n\nTrump on the other hand has been sued for housing discrimination against black people before, he has called Nazis \"very fine people\" whether he will admit to that or not, because there weren't any non nazis among those people and there definitly weren't fine people marching along with the swastikas at charlottesville. There were no fine people chanting \"Jews will not replace us\" or \"blood and soil\", nor were there any fine people walking along side them. So comparing them to the counter protestors, ya know, the people protesting against nazis... Yea not so good. \n\nTrump also called for the execution of a few black men after the fact that they had been found innocent of a crime they were accused of. The Central Park Five. He let his crowd chant \"send them back\" about American congress women because they were brown, which he seemed to enjoy quite a lot for a non racist man. Argued that an American born \"mexican\" judge was bisaed or unfit because of his heritage. I.e because he's brown, or because his parrents are mexican he was unable to rule fairly.\n\nThere was the time he retweeted a video of people chanting white power, though he claims it was an accident, these accidents seem to happen a lot to him. Like when he told a white supremacist militia to \"stand back and stand by\"\n\nBut of course the most notable thing. He CONSTANTLY LIES ABOUT MEXICAN MIGRANTS. I can't begin to count how many times he's called them \"rapists, murderers and smuglers\" and \"some are good people\"... *Some* implies he believes a minority of them are good people, as in 51% or more are criminals according to him... But they commit LESS crime than the native population. He also said the migrants comming in where \"like UFC fighters\" but I only see old frail people, women, children, and young men. But Trump created the immage that they are dangerous people. So he fearmongered for years, got the American population scared and angry at them, advocated for the construction of a wall. He also THREW THEM IN CONCENTRATION CAMPS.

I don't identify the country with all people living there and most likely he does not either.\nAnd to your claim: There are huge huge differences. One being that the the USA were founded from the very beginning as a burgeois imperialist state that was run by slave-owners. Other states were founded in a different manner. Take Switzerland: It is also a burgeois state, however, it was founded as a defensive alliance against surrounding stronger states and never had an expansive agenda. Yet other states were founded as feudal states.\nThe card you are playing of saying that evil is simply a part of civilaziation and any civilization did what the US is doing is simply wrong. Sure, the USA is not the only state that commited crimes, but no one is claiming this. What is being claimed is that it was founded as an imperialist project and founded as such it was. As such it relied from the beginning on many people that were exploitet and that made up the majority of \"the Americans\".",

I think this detail is something worth noting when you remember one of the inciting actions behind the American revolution was that, prior to independence, British Imperial troops stationed in the American territories did not answer to the local civil authorities, and were consequently allowed to get away with multiple criminal acts; it was consequently a detail specifically stated in the Constitution of the United States (and the first article at that!) that the military should be answerable to a civil authority. By arguing against that principle here, Flaherty is arguing against both the Constitution of the United States, and in fact one of the principles behind the American revolution itself!",

        "text": "@maxw.2579 To play devils advocate: they at least have to pretent. And a lot of european nations like Germany have a system of criminal accountability for their soldiers based on legal problems during the Nuremburg trials. Is a soldier liable for his actions if he was ordered to? Or can he be prosecuted for following orders if a refusal meant a crime in itself? What about ideology-driven descisions of an individual, is the officer responsible?\n\nThe solution they came up with is the concept \"civilian in uniform\"- even after the draft has been ended and the Bundeswehr professionalised. The general tone in the army is compared to the US  less screaming, less militaristic pride bullshit, more professional and respectfull conduct from soldier and officer. A soldier can refuse an direct order if it goes against his conscience and wont be persecuted even if damage results from that, his commanding officer is liable for miscommunicating the situation if that happens and responsibility and accountability go up the chain of command from there. On the other hand, this makes an soldier directly legally responsible for his own individual conduct outside direct command. Is he not excused by the circumstances of the situation, his head is on the block, and worse than an civilian would be- because the uniform means an extra level of responsibility that takes away a major level of legal protection, unlike the US who often grant their forces immunity. Also, the Bundeswehr at least, through psychological testing nominally tries to block nutjobs from joining the forces, though not really effectively, but they wont hire the usual US nutjobs like those Blackwater guys because those probably wont be able to stick with this code of conduct.\n\nNot to say there are no scandals to find here, far from it, especially far right extremists in the army. But at least systematically there is some actual legal accountability compared to some shady corporation, also parlamentary and therefore public oversight. Some years ago an officer ordered an airstrike on an visibly armed convoy with gas-tankers that was on direct course towards a base. But also visible were women and children in the trucks. The guy had to make a descision- and ordered the strike. Huge scandal in Germany. There was a public investigation into the descision, and a trial. \n\nIm not saying that the action was necessary, or that the judges who aquitted the guy were right. But \"civilian in uniform\" is a far cry from how the US employs and shields its soldiers or PMCs from prosecution. \nA soldier is usually seen as something like an external policeman bound by law and regulations, a professional job like any other and not beyond criticism, with the ability to kill but also the responsibilities and need for accountability that come with that, not some muscled-up gun-slinging superhero beyond the rules who gets shielded by his country if he steps out of bounds. \n\nEven if ones a pacifist I hope one can see the difference here. I agree the system needs much improvement though.",

The environment they consequently create for their family members will produce some similar ambitions and a similar dis-regard for ethics. They are taught greed over moral principles. They are taught only moral principles that do not invalidate their positions of power.\nI am not trying to blame you personally for any misconceptions, but this sort of casual genetical mis-explanation just shows how some deeply racist pseudo-science just refuses to fully die in our public discourse. Genetics is real and important and worth studying. However, it is dangerous as a singular go-to explanation for human behaviour. I hope I didn't bother you.\n\n\n(If I didn't bother you, you might want to check out youtube for Stanford's Robert Sapolski.

Regressing only guarantees  that we will be one step behind as the rest of the world continues to progress",

This \"rally\" peaked in political murder if I may remind you since white Nationalists are unable to handle criticism as a main feature of freedom of speech. Fox News supports actual, swastika-flag waving, sieg-heiling Nazis and awareness about this needs to be raised nationwide!",
