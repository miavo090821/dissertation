Are Black women not Black too? It feels like white feminism.

In this case we are addressing Kendrick & Drake and their associations and you keep trying to make the distinction about \"personal\" as opposed to \"professional \" and yet the association still stands...besides as far as is known Baka served as bodyguard and security personnel at Drake's events.  He transitioned into music, making his debut with background vocals on the Nothing Was The Same album. He was later signed to the OVO sound label and had his own songs such as Live Up To My Name, 4Milli &more. It appears he sees Drake as his \"BOSS,\" so I am not sure why you think their association is \"personal,\" but you can draw that distinction all you want.

I know that Kendrick has had beef with Drake for more than a decade, but the one thing that's tough for me is that if Kendrick platforms Dr. Dre & Kodak Black because of the ideas of generational trauma & forgiveness, then in a way it makes me feel that if Drake didn't lie & didn't mention Kendrick's fiancée, Kendrick would have kept it a \"friendly fade\" and not exposed Drake, which is awful to keep secret if Drake's alleged crimes are true.",

He just extorted him with information that wasn't public knowledge and eventually Drake's team shut it down. Typically in rap beef you don't wanna \"expose\" your opponent bc even if you have differences with the guy, it makes you look bad, and it opens yourself up for slander and harsh criticism. But this was no ordinary beef. Kendrick is a real father and an authentic musical artist and Drake is a man child who abuses women and takes people's work for his own. +The way Kendrick was rapping like 12 yrs ago is just clear indication to my eyes that he knew what was up the whole time. \"CSI just might investigate this fucking parasite\" has like 5 different connotations now.",

        "text": "@SeanLKearns yeah I get that, since most of the allegations of Drake have been known since 2017. On a second level I feel like that since Drake exposed Pusha T had a fiancée I think Kendrick knew that Drake was eventually going to mention something about Whitney regardless . Yeah I agree that Kendrick has known and has been sneak-dissing Drake's alleged crimes for a long time, you should check out LOOK OUT FOR DETOX, it has a line very similar to Euphoria.  I guess the difference between Drake and the other two artists Kendrick has worked with recently is that Dr. Dre paid one of the lawsuits & eventually apologized, and Kodak had to serve time for his crimes and eventually apologized, I guess the difference is Drake hasn't changed, hasn't been punished and doesn't apologize.",

For sexual assault against women it's almost brushed aside, not as important, and we only want to call attention to someone if they were messing with children or if they are male and gay. The fact that these men keep getting called out for these actions, and only people like diddy's get fingers pointed at them, but it was mostly because he was gay, and not for actually assaulting people. I dont know what leftist expectations we should remove, when talking about things that affect black women in these communities, that's caused by the men perpetuating these problems while pretending to be our protectors.",

    "text": "59:56 You see how magic works?? I tuned in to listen to some interesting analysis on a topic I know ABSOLUTELY NOTHING about (hip hop, its main characters or history even though I lived through its creative cycle) and the conversation involves into some real talk about how to not turn away from the ugliness in ourselves and how we project onto others in the form of abuse by our family members, friends to us and to others. I have a brother who is an abuser multiple times multiple ways. He has trauma he hasn’t chosen to address and it spills ALL OVER his life and relationships. He was my protector, my teacher when I was little and I don’t like who he has become and won’t pretend at all it’s cool with me. My mother 83 Christian wants to believe if we just love him and appreciate him more and not talk about the consequences of his abuse on the women and children who are in early adulthood now one has tried to commit suicide, there’s addiction, self-negation behaviors but we supposed to see that as just normal family shit. It’s US humans that normalized it doing the best we could with the information we have. My thing is the INFORMATION is there. It’s widely talked about therapy, trauma therapy, nervous system dysregulation, generational trauma….and whether you choose or don’t encounter never heard of it like me until 2020, we are still responsible for blowing our shit into other people’s and psyches. Someone has to start. Just one. To start. And we can all liberate ourselves and show others it is possible. Violence is a choice but we haven’t been able to make the choice because of the water we swim in. \n\nThank you all for the work you do in your lives and on this medium. This soon to be 61 year old is learning so much from your perspectives. We are people who have been abused for so long that numbing means abusing the next generation. May we know we CAN stop.

He can talk all he wants to about Drake and what Drake has allegedly done and who Drake hangs out with. But, really, it’s a widespread problem in hip-hop and throughout the culture, if I’m being honest. The problem I have with this discussion is that it felt like Kendrick and Drake are being scapegoated for a larger problem that we have. If we are going to hold these moral standards when it comes to both men and Dr. Dre, Kodak Black, Baka, etc. then hip-hop is in HUGE trouble. We need to hold them ALL accountable. In other words, we’re all hypocrites. All of us. No one on this panel will stop supporting Drake or Kendrick. No one on this panel will stop supporting many of these hip-hop artists, most of them who mistreat women, are deadbeat dads, engage in acts of violence, etc. Maybe hip-hop needs to die because the misogynior is never going away until we hold them all accountable. Thanks for this discussion. I hope that as much outrage shown towards Kendrick and Drake, Dre and Kodak, that outrage will be transferred to all of these problematic rappers and the culture in general. If ya’ll continue to support Chris Brown, Future and 50 Cent and others, then I don’t see progress being made at all. HOLD THEM ALL ACCOUNTABLE—not just those we don’t like.",

In fact I think Dre was also brought to  have a legend there, but as a Kendrick fan, it is completely tone deaf to still have them out there when I mean easily could’ve replaced him with someone else from the West Coast that may have had it similar impact there, but I think, the exclusion of the game was intentional he openly sided with Drake.

I think people ascribe that to him simply because he addresses topics that are rarely addressed in hip hop music.\n\nRather Kendrick positions himself as a human with human experiences and often honestly and purposefully portrays his hypocritical and contradictory ways.\n\nThink the last 2 bars of The Blacker The Berry in 2015 all the way up to Mr. Morale album where he addresses sexual abuse but then also has Kodak Black (noteworthy for his abuse case) sort of host the album and even calls himself Kodak Black.\n\nNow go listen to Prayer by Kendrick Lamar where he says \"I can't help we jump in these bodies and you call them a God/ just know the earth is just a rock without the voices of art\".\n\nThis all shows that Kendrick does approach this hypocrisy within himself, his music, and the world with much forethought. But rather it's from a human perspective and not a morally superior perspective.\n\nI think what he's trying to say is this, we all deal with this world and ourselves as flawed and we have to look in the mirror and struggle with that. Maybe there is no perfect solution as we're all imperfect human beings. But the best thing we can do is be human through it all. Make your mistakes, don't hide them and hold yourself accountable.\n\nI prob didn't break that down the best way but I just wanted to show how I think Kendrick does approach his art with alot of what you guys discussed in mind.",

I think Kendrick was VERY aware of what he was doing bringing Dre up on stage. I believe there’s many nuances to that just like how there was for Kodak Black’s features on Kendrick’s last album, MMATBS.",

It's a critique of hip-hop and how it still promotes this black capitalist point of view that isn't working anymore, society is moving towards a more socialist view now. The same hyper capitalistic view that allows for people like Drake to exist in the industry and Dr.Dre to get away with domestic violence with almost every woman he's been, but he's allegedly gay on the low. Hyper capitalism promotes violence towards women, Hip hop is a small byproduct of it that had led to dramatic devastating consequences for the us black americans. As a kendrick fan I think he should have just left Dr Dre out on the stand and just did an honorable tribute for Dre impact on hip hop culture.",

Lil Wayne and Gucci Mane are very well respected by the culture when compared to Kodak.  Kendrick was looking for someone who the majority of people would immediately question as to \"why is that degenerate on a K Dot album\".  This is explored when you listen to Kodak's interludes especially in the Big Steppers LP.  But that's just my reading of the album.  Speaks to me a bit differently maybe because I'm an old head and my life views changed when I became a father",

Acknowledging your mistakes and owning up to the things you have done deserves some recognition. Dr Dre was a huge part of Kendrick success there was no way he was not going to be there plus his contribution to West Coast hip-hop. What I will say though is people trying to compare Dre past to Drake pedo fails in comparison. Drake friend having a human trafficking case fails in comparison to anything Dre has done. Both morally messed up but we speaking of past mistakes that were acknowledged and present situations that are currently going on now that we having been seeing and hearing about for years. Dre past is irrelevant to what’s being exposed about the industry now and how these takes on platforms only shine light away from what’s really going on. Yes if everyone wants to hold Dre past against him I’m all for it 30yrs ago compared to what’s happening now idk.",

It’s always, “he’s a woman beater” but we live in a world where woman have freedoms, a mind and voice of their own. They have power to express themselves and their opinions whether good or bad and with that the ability to lash out or cause DV incidents as well but you will never hear about that. I’m a cop and I see this all the time. Men and woman are both capable of being abusive in a relationship but woman are never called out to this degree because there’s an expectation of protection by the masses. A woman smacks you, and as a man, if you hit her back somehow you’re the bad one because you’re bigger or stronger. Cases of this are all over social media but when these conversations about DV come up, there’s never anyone speaking to how both parties have a responsibility to do the right thing. Regardless of whether or not it hurts the same, abuse is abuse and the discourse is warranted from both sides.",
