[Music] hello Carlos how are you hello how are you doing thank you for having me on how are you doing so thank you for joining us on Venezuela decides and we all we wanted to ask you to begin this analysis what is your read on the relevance of the election process that is going on in Venezuela right now it's extremely important um as I'm sure the audience knows uh Venezuela is set to join bricks fairly recently which means having Venezuela be incorporated into this new emerging multi-polar World led by Russia China Iran and other key key players saying no to American imperialist uh unip poity and with that joining of bricks what will come about in Venezuela is common Prosperity economic growth and the general Improvement M of the Venezuelan population what that is going to produce of course the full solidification of the Socialist Party of Malo within the uh Venezuelan Society so the opposition understands very well that this is uh their last opportunity to regain power their last opportunity to sell out their country their Homeland their people their resources to America and the American imperialist Powers who are who the opposition actually represents so this is why they are so dangerous this is why we have seen the cause for violence and Terror they hope to uh breed fear into the Venezuelan people but as someone who has been able to see about a dozen or so voting booths today uh the chavistas have been out all day as Jorge Rodriguez was able to say not too long ago uh it's a victory for Marudo as expected and uh I think what was on the line today was Venezuelan sovereignty is Venezuela going to be able to forge its own path its own future autonomously or is it going to sell out its interests its land to the US and become once again a neoc colony caros as we continue go analyzing in part of what you were saying about the relevance of this election process of course all of this process coming up to today the election day has been marked but an immense amount of media interference what some have called uh propaganda bombardment and of course it comes to call once again the interference of major powers in Venezuelan Internal Affairs for what Venezuela represents in many aspects and particularly us interference in what is happening today in Venezuela we were analyzing earlier today a tweet posted by CA Harris vice president of the US what is your take on the position that the United States continues to carry towards Venezuela In This Moment In Time well it's important to understand that Venezuela is a very rich country a country that's rich in people uh that and that is rich in resources it's it's got the largest the second largest oil reserves in the world and those are oil reserves that American uh Imperial interest private big Monopoly entities want to regain control of and because they understand that there is full popularity of the bolivarian Revolution within the Venezuelan people all they can do is around and say fraud electoral fraud well the reality is that as American president himself Jimmy Carter said Venezuela has the most democratic system in the world it's a system that I have been able to see here in my time in karakas as an American and I can confirm that what Jimmy Carter said is absolutely true it is preposterous that the US where only 19% of the American people think that their representatives represent them has the audacity to sit here and talk about the absence of democracy in Venezuela to sit here and describe vene Venezuela as an authoritarian Al led by a dictator named Mauro it turns the world upside down and that's all that they have it is important to understand that the opposition is not even acting out of its own Val they are not representing the Venezuelan people and they never had the the opposition in Venezuela is essentially puppets of American Empire who want to go back to a condition where Venezuelan oil belonged to a small click of Western multinational corporations that got rich off of uh stealing the resources of the Venezuelan people and now moving forward we were talking about the interference and the reasons behind this interference and of course one of the things has to do with the well the wealth that um has Venezuela as a country that has for example of course the oil and oil production and that has been the key uh the key element behind a lot of the well so-called sanctions or unilateral coercive measures targeting the country now what can we think about what is going to happen from Tomorrow onwards in the climate of international interference that is going on how do you read that U movement that political moment right now well as you mentioned Camala Harris made a very ambiguous statement she said that the us is going to respect whatever the Venezuelan people democratically will the problem with that of course is that the Dem the the Venezuelan people have consistently election after election willed to continue Barian Revolution and the results are just completely tossed out uh first by the opposition candidates within Venezuela who have been also proclaiming that their uh tra treacherous uh uh traiter candidate was the one that actually won and then of course by the US itself that rejects uh unfoundedly with absolutely no evidence the results of Venezuelan election there's absolutely no evidence to any of the claims that the US has previously made so I think that there's little weit and way too much ambiguity in Harris's statement and it opens the door so that uh as people are celebrating this great chalista wi uh the far right fascistic forces of the opposition come out and do what they've been promising for weeks which is a bloodbath they have been promising to terrorize the Venezuelan people their own brothers and sisters they have come out and sacrificed roosters which are of course the symbol of the Venezuelan Revolution and the symbology the imagery couldn't be any more clear they're seeking blood they're seeking to dispose of President maudo and top leadership there's comments going around semi viral in the far right Venezuelan Medias and social medias about attacking uh not just chavistas but anyone who has ever aligned themselves with chavismo so these are literal forces of teror that are backed up by the US and if the US finds it worthy to intervene that ambition youat from Kamala Harris such that if the opposition says they Harris can affirm that's what the will of the vuelan people is and perfectly uh possibly send in forces to back up the opposition Carlos I I also wanted to ask you about the importance of activism and also how the comrades in the US for example can take its stand in this context we are talking about the country's interference we we're talking about State interest but we know that activism in the US has also been very important to also point out the hypocrisy point out and demand from their governments a different stance on different international issues just this year for example all the mobilization um to stop the the genocide in Gaza have been very important and very significant worldwide to at least turn the value on what is happening there do you see something like that being able to happen in regards to interference uh in Latin America in different countries and in spe specifically in Venezuela at this moment what are the different things that could be done um from there to support the struggle here the most important thing to remember is whether we are talking about the genocide in Palestine the new Cold War against China the proxy war against Russia or the uh General Wars that the US's uh uh wages against the axes of resistance Iran and other countries or the current discourse and attacks on Venezuela which of course include 930 criminal uh sanctions also known as unilateral cive measures what is important for Americans to understand is that we should support these struggles against American imperialism not simply out of some uh middle class moralism and empathy we have to support these struggles primarily because they are not two separate interests the interest of the American people is the interest of Venezuelan sovereignty it is the interest of Russian sovereignty of Cuban sovereignty of chines sovereignty the enemy of the American people the enemy that keeps us poor that keeps us indeed that keeps us desperate is the same enemy that sends hundreds of billions of our tax dollars to Russia it's the same enemy that questions unfoundedly elections inene that inates violence in Venezuela so what we have to understand my people in America have to understand is that we have to support the chavista government and the bolivarian revolution not out of some lofty ideals or morality or empathy but out of concrete a concrete realization that the interest that we have the people who we're fighting against is the same as the chav if the chavistas win if the Venezuelan people can affirm their sovereignty and continue their bolivarian Revolution we win it's interconnected the people who we're fighting against are a part of the same class same people that put the 930 sanctions on Venezuela are the same ones that lead individuals like myself to be in $100,000 of debt for doing something as crazy as wanting to get an education and they do the same thing to uh Millions tens of millions of Americans for daring to get an education for daring to have a home to live in or for getting sick and not having medical insurance so the interest of the Venezuelan Revolution and the interest of the American working class is one and that's the most important thing I think we have to affirm and let the American people know now of course despite on despite of what mainstream media and also propaganda have been trying to impose a narrative on what is happen happening now in Venezuela today Democratic elections took place there was a democratic day people were out in the street celebrating all the reports from both inside and also International collaborators say that the day was lived with a lot of tranquility and this is a very important day in um in Venezuela and sometimes it seems that the discussion regarding um what the propaganda try to install on Venezuela has has not allowed us to understand this as an an electoral dispute and to really understand what is this opposition that is running um against the Chavis pro project against the ruling party what do they represent what do they want what type of country are they proposing as a model how could you describe this opposition in Venezuela well I would have to go to the Apostle of my motherland Jose who described these people uh in a very uh telling phrase he called them he called them worms with B ties they're the sort of individuals that sell out their people that sell out their Homeland in order to have their pockets lined up and fattened by uh by by the American imperialist so that's the essential character of the opposition and this is why what we have to affirm is that what's at stake is not just the continuation of the bolivarian process but it's Venezuela itself because Venezuela's existence as an autonomous Sovereign entity is intimately tied to the bolivarian process if the bolivarian process Falls which I can assure you it will not I've been seeing thousands of Venezuelans in the streets and the vast majority of them are not only with the revolution but willing to sacrifice everything to protect it but God forbid if the Venezuelan Revolution fell it would mean the end of Venezuela as a free autonomous Sovereign entity and the return to a Venezuela that is a neoc colony of the US and Western multinationals who only seek to loot the very rich resources of Venezuela to uh accumulate as much Capital as possible in the hands of a very few while the vast majority of vuelan struggle so we were talking about different issues and one of them the most important perhaps to think about the last years impacting the bolivarian revolution has had to do with International interference particularly the us but also the UN different sanctions imposed on the country and I wanted to ask to you what kind of strategies do you understand from a geopolitical stance that Venezuela has been taken and could continue to take to um go over the sanctions and start in the path of overcoming this hardships that the last years appear to to show that it has already been set on that track so in terms of cooperation in the region you were mentioning the Caribbean region but also alliances all over the world how do you see Venezuela from a standpoint in its relations geopolitical relations around the world well the uh continual process of Venezuelan sovereignty and Revolution I think it's tied as it is with Cuba as it is with as it is with Iran to uh bricks because what bricks represent is the skeleton the basis the foundation for a new world a world where international relations have uh been revolutionized in terms of the logic that animates them from uh unilateral imposition of the America's will on other countries to what the Chinese like to call win-win relations so uh I think it is evident and this is why the opposition is uh is is so particularly dangerous this time around that with Venezuela's inclusion into bricks we're only going to see an intensified version of what we've seen with uh it its very close relationships with Iran which is what has allowed Venezuela since 2019 to weather the storm a storm where 99% of the earnings they were making were virtually removed because of the hardships of us sanctions and hybrid Warfare because it's not just sanctions there's ships filled with oil that were coming from Iran that the US like liberal Pirates would kidnap and then give it to American oil companies so it's it's a hybrid warfare that's been waged against not just V but anyone who dares to exist outside of the sphere of influence of us Empire and just like the relations with Iran have been the basis of Venezuela's e economic improvement over the last five years its inclusion within bricks its ability to engage with the sh cooperation corporation uh the Eurasian economic Union and all these other in international uh institutions uh founded on uh on a belief in multipolarity a belief in bilateral relations that are mutually beneficial Venezuela's incorporation into this new world that is developing is going to be the basis of of its ability to defend itself from the attacks coming from the US Empire what do you think is the relevance of today for the region well it's a general Victory not just for those forces in the region which are actually Sovereign so the forces that are not controlled by puppets of the American government but it's also a a win for the upand cominging uh embryonic but still very much developing multi-polar World itself it's a wi that I'm sure will be celebrated in Iran it's a one that I'm sure will be celebrated in Russia in China I got to speak with uh delegates from Russia and from China and they are very much conscious of the importance of Venezuela in this upand cominging multipolar world so the victory of the bolivarian Revolution today is is something that has has impacts well beyond just Venezuela well beyond the Patria Grande this region that Venezuela is incorporating at in in the western hemisphere has influences for the whole world it's a Monumental victory for the forces of multipolarity and against the forces of imperialism which are showing more and more their decrepit uh character so you were talking about the reactions that are coming from other parts of the world of course you were mentioning for example comrades in Russia following this election how do you think that activism from all around the world are looking at what is happening in Venezuela also looking at how different main International Powers such as the US and the European Union for example are reacting to the Democratic process in Venezuela and what that can mean for other countries in the global South for example what whatever happens to Venezuela is that a call of attention for the rest of the world it absolutely is uh this victory in Venezuela is something that as I mentioned will be celebrated by all free people around the world and look we have to we have to be honest with ourselves uh the situation in Venezuela provides a lot of Hope for a lot of people and even I would uh so dare say that uh if uh we do our job correctly in the US it will come a time time where this is a victory that could be celebrated by the vast majority of the American people because fundamentally the interest that Venezuela is fighting against are the same interest that keep us miserable at home and I would venture as far as to say uh given the fact that uh recent polls show that only 11% of the American people trust what the Legacy Media what the mainstream media says I would say that a whole lot of them are probably skeptical about how the US media is describing this election which of course is the same uh narrative that it always uses because the opposition that they fund can't win because they can't win the people on a platform of returning to be an an Neo Colony they're forced to cry fraud uh months ahead of time on an electoral process that a president from the US itself called the most democratic in the world so the American people recognize that the media is uh is there to lie to us it's the media that lied to us about Iran uh Iraq Afghanistan Libya that has lied to us about Russia and virtually everything and that does it for a very specific reason it doesn't do it just because the media are compulsive liars and and somehow they always end up hiring really bad compulsive liar character types uh they do it for a specific reason they represent the interests that benefit from the overthrowing of these popular sovereign uh projects that are quite literally constructing a new world as as it unfolds right before us and now in the face of what you were saying regarding a lot of disbelief of the media for example and also that would be a sign that well many people are more and more aware that these are actually like confronting narratives and there is a struggle going on there on how we tell our world world and our struggles what do you think is the role that alternative media Global South media uh left media needs to play in this in this role in this struggle what does that media need to do to overcome that mainstream narrative well it's essential um in order for the system of those who put the accumulation of capital as Supreme in order for that system to survive it needs to reproduce itself at the level of ideas it needs these ideological institutions like the media education Etc that can convince people who have a fundamentally uh adverse and antagonistic interest to the ruling order that they should accept the ruling order the only way to challenge the lies that are systematically pumped out by these institutions is to create alternative people's institutions institutions like tesur institutions like uh Midwestern marks which I I work as a director for and I think uh you know to to get to something quite concrete if we look at American uh Twitter what's been trending in American Twitter Venezuela's been at the top the Venezuelan elections and it's quite literally mixed in terms of opinion you have uh people like Alam musk of course who applauded the coup in 2019 in Bolivia and said well K who we want I wonder if the lithium that is in Bolivia's ground had anything to do with it but you had people like Elon Musk promoting a candidate like bacho that literally asked for the Zionist entity The Entity carrying out a horrendous genocide against the Palestinian people to invade Venezuela musk endorses her and says that the future of Venezuela is with her a few other farri forces are promoted a lot of them through bot farms and this isn't a conspiracy theory there's literal bot Farms that are essential in getting things trending and when they begin to Trend what you have is a a changing of how things are seen and the era that we live in people come to pass judgments on the basis of how things are seen as being seen if they go see a video and all the comments are negative that's going to affect their perception of that video it's a form of second order observation so you have on one side all of these people supporting the opposition probably boosted quite a bit by thoughts and then on the other side you have my colleague who's here with me in karakas Venezuela Jackson hle uh who's a communist Anti-Imperialist uh media personality and journalist a member of our party and who's uh been the most viral person on Twitter getting the message out our party Twitter uh the American Communist party has been able to also get messages out and right now it seems like there's really two or three creators that are uh getting um the pro Marudo uh narrative which is the true narrative out uh and then the vast majority of of of the other people like musk and and far right-wingers who are spreading lives and so that battle is essential excellent caros so before we finish I wanted to ask in the face of everything that you were saying in the face of the media bombardment of the or the propaganda bombardment as one of the analysts called it hours ago in the face of all of this context what would you uh tell any anyone from the audience hearing not from Venezuela not from the Latin American region maybe but from outside in other parts of the world what would you tell them about Venezuela what do we need to keep in mind to understand what is really happening today in the South American Nation and what is its stake there two things uh first I've seen the voting process I have participated in the end of campaign rally and was able to see see millions of Venezuelans out in the streets of karakas in tune with the words that Malo was saying singing CH songs and uh you know there's this great clip that went viral of a young kid 11 12 year old kid on the shoulders of his father in the rally that I attended singing the national anthem of uh Venezuela so um it what's clear to me as someone who has been here for around a week now is that the Venezuelan people are with the uh bolivarian Revolution uh there should be no surprise that this has been an electoral victory for Malo the second thing I would say to our International viewers to those outside of Venezuela is to not think for one second that this is just a Venezuela issue as we've been trying to hammer out throughout this discussion this affects everyone if imperialism is able to win if the US is able to to return Venezuela to a neoc colony uh having uh the little comador elements of the opposition at the hel but really being guided from the US that's a big loss for the whole multipolar world it's a big loss for La grand for for our America for for the whole hemisphere it's a big loss for American working people who of course face the same enemy so do not think for one second that Venezuela's election is just an issue of Venezuela it affects all of us and mauro's victory is something that we should all celebrate because it's our Victory too and uh had there been a defeat uh we should have also been um saddened by by that defeat because it would have been our defeat as well but thankfully as anyone who has been able to experience the pulse of the Venezuelan people would have known what we have seen is a staggering victory of more than 20 points over the treacherous and and and trous uh opposition excellent thank you Carlos for joining us in Venezuela the SES tonight thank you for having me that was Carlos Garo director of the midwestern Mark Institute philosophy professor and also educational Secretary of the US Communist Party we'll go for a short break now don't go away [Music]
