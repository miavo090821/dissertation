Please point to the military dictator that was overthrown by peaceful worker strikes. \n\nBut please really think it through before you do provide an example. Think to yourself before posting \"what will Hello There reply to this example with\". Remember you would be trying to find an example similar to Iraq. So a brutal dictator of 40ish years preferably with a significant military and secret police.\n\nP.S. The worker strikes bit is gonna be the hard thing to prove. I would suggest you take that bit back and just go with general nonviolent revolution. As for examples, maybe the democracy movements against the military dictatorships of South Korea and Taiwan would be good? But the economic situations were vastly different so idk.

        "text": "@HelloThere-xx1ct Your misconception is that oppression is economically sustainable. As we learned with WW2 germany, with the antebellum south, with most of those large scale dictatorships, it's not. When you can't get food for your kids, you really have nothing left to lose. Political insecurity starts to arise, and that's what leads to the downfall of dictators, the fact that they can't maintain control over their population, the fact that they can't maintain supply chains. It might not necessarily be peaceful, but it's something that's done by the will of the people, rather than the will of a separate imposing nation. Without sustained supply chains, things fall apart extremely quickly. You know, like the arab spring, the thing that actually ended up leading to the emancipation of several countries. The only exception I can think of to this is those countries which are super poor from exterior factors, like globalized trade destroying domestic economies, and fear of foreign military intervention, but I think to equate domestic oppression with foreign oppression wouldn't be accurate.\nYou're also ascribing to the US a set of morals, and that's questionable. Without WMDs, and with UN oversight to energy production, there's not a massive security threat, not from iraq, and thus, the US has no real self-preservation reason to invade. There's maybe a security threat from saudi arabia, but as the US has established time and again, they're willing to overlook the true saudi dictatorship responsible for 9/11 and other human rights disasters, as long as it sustains the oil lobby. The real reason is that iraq is a useful deflection from the former, and the economic benefits of war to the US are seen to be greater, or at least, acceptable. As in, war sustains the military industrial complex.",

That's rather absurd. \n\nIn fact, international laws (such as the UN Charter) are rather unambiguous about Wars of Aggression and Preventative Warfare being crimes rather than obligations. \n\nThe only thing that could have made the invasion even technically legal would have been a UN resolution to rubberstamp it as a \"police action\", but of course that never happened. \n\nSaddam Hussein was not \"being allowed to reign free\". His army was left in tatters in 1991, and prevented from rebuilding by a decade of extremely harsh trade embargoes that also wrecked the entire national economy and severely inhibited the rebuilding of even civilian infrastructure. American warplanes were still conducting airstrikes in Iraq on a regular basis throughout the 1990's for the sake of enforcing the ban on Iraqi military units entering the northern third of their own country due to previous atrocities there. The Kurds were pretty damn near de facto independent. \n\nYou're engaging in pretty blatant false-dilemma fallacy if you actually mean to imply that the only possible alternative to the war as it happened was to do absolutely nothing else to prevent or inhibit any future action by the Hussein government, much less trying to pin responsibility for \"all of Saddam's potential future crimes\" on people who understood and were willing to acknowledge the reality that the invasion had no legitimate reason to happen and was likely to lead to catastrophe (or people who have understood and acknowledged these facts in retrospect since then). \n\nCome on, man.

Apparently, things were swell in Iraq after we stopped Saddam’s first genocide and we probably could’ve left it there? I don’t understand what you’re arguing. You present no plan to stop an inter generational military dictatorship. Saddam used chemical weapons on his own people. He lost his right to rule then and there. Every country with the ability to do so should’ve helped uninstall him. \n\nAmerica only becomes the world’s police because of the moral complacency of the rest of the world. If America doesn’t act literal genocides occur like Rwanda. It’s as simple as that. The moral complacency of the international community is so great the US felt it needed to lie on an international stage just to gather support to take out one of the world’s greatest dictators. It’s not like uninstalling Saddam and democratizing Iraq was ever gonna be on the agenda at the UN. The international community has never taken a single major action without the US leading the charge. Without US action we would be talking now about how to uninstall Saddam’s son because Saddam would’ve died peacefully in his sleep years ago without ever paying for a single crime.",

In fact, when nations choose a freedom that doesn't serve US interests, intervention is almost just as guaranteed. South America as a whole is a good example of this. \n\nYou can be against the Iraq War as a matter of policy because this one example of US intervention leading to a tenous democracy (after decades of wholesale slaughter and the instigation of ISIS) is more of a \"happy accident\" than a true guiding purpose of American intervention.

Its nearly impossible to speculate beyond the fall of the Hussein regime would create the huge power vacuum that guarantees civil conflict with or without the US involved. I would rate it as very unlikely that Iraq gets even a fraction of the democracy they now have without some sort of outside intervention. Without the US when Saddam falls another military dictator of some sort would be the most likely to retake power. \n\nSuffice it to say, worst case scenario the US \"saved no one\" by getting involved in an inevitable civil conflict and they were responsible for a tragic the tragic deaths of 10,000. What was gained in the conflict by the US government participation and nation building efforts was a secular democracy in Iraq.

It's difficult and dangerous to keep WMDs viable. The lab could have simply lost refrigeration or something. It's also possible they were destroyed in one of our (thousands of) bombing attacks.

Valid, but a bit much.\n\nI will not try and speak for the people there, as ir is their country and their feelings can matter, they can tell us to fuck off and die, to an extent with good reason (although who “us” is is always an issue i think we can all improve on), but in my *horrendously biased and privileged position*, i think a corrupt shitty democracy that you can protest and try/hope to change *without being disappeared or publicly executed* is better than a corrupt dictatorship.\n\nGranted one *can* push the “Stable Dictatorship vs Clusterfuck Beginning Democracy” opinion, and sure, and that’s not my decision.  As long as they are just a dictatorship in their own borders, don’t do warcrimes to their own people like Assad, sure.\n\nBut i have decently grounded hope that in a generation or to, if not a more optimistic Few Decades, Iraq will be an even more amazing place than it was before.  Return to the level of respect and acheivement it had as a “valley of civilization” Or it’s people’s contributions  as part of the Islamic Golden Age.\n\nWe may think we’re hot shit in the USA, but after years of trying we are in the gridlock of our system barely doing good.

The US-Iraq war was a lot more recent, it was internationally condemned, it was unprovoked, and it was a direct, brutal invasion. Furthermore, as you just acknowledged, the USSR didn't invade Iraq.

And as someone who'd been terminally online since 1996, I noticed a distinct rise in people openly promoting shameless bigotry (\"race realism\") and even open naziism online in the mid-2000's.  Every internet forum had at least one self-described nazi at the time, which you would not have seen prior to 2001.  But yeah.  Nobody talks about it.  And it all coincides directly with Bush admin rhetoric and fearmongering regarding terrorism in the first few years following 9/11.  I told everyone that we were on a path to fascism, and something like the Trump era was coming.  Now we're in the Trump era, and instead of seeing the trail of causality, they want to engage in nostalgia about how they miss Bush as a more civil and respectable republican.

It was wild to see the difference between how in the US there was one acceptable view - in the words of Bush, you are with us or against us - vs. our media which was far more critical.  And our politicians, some of whom dared stand up to the US (naturally the Conservatives were howling for war, but they did not yet hold power, thankfully).  \n\nYou know, I’m not an especially nationalistic person, but one day I had true pride in my country is when our PM told the US that we would not get involved in Iraq.  \n\nAnyway, it is very conceivable to me that Americans have been sold lies and believe them.

Nowadays, humans using biological weaponry largely tend to favor the spores or toxins that have particularly lethal outcomes for the target(s) over the infectious agent itself (for the simple reason that you don't want to accidentally have your own weapon jump over to your own forces after the next contact with the enemy).

Iraq's military was thoroughly destroyed, with a substantial portion of its equipment lost (in particular the air defense assets and much of their armor), and Saddam was thoroughly convinced that any action against his neighbors would be met with international sanction. \n\nHe was unable to reignite hostilities with Iran (lacking the international support which made it possible in the first place), Syria was suddenly more powerful after the losses he suffered, and Jordan was not a viable target due to geographic limitations. Kuwait and the Saudis had US military assets on standby to crush any attempt he might make with US air power as well. From the perspective of conventional war, Saddam wasn't a threat. He didn't have any actual connections to jihadi groups (or at least had fewer than our erstwhile allies in the Saudi government), and the WMD lies were absurd in numerous ways.",

Then, during the cold war, it was mostly applied to nuclear and radiological weapons since that's what everyone was afraid of at the time, and now the usage is more limited to cbrn weapons in general.  The lie wasn't the usage of the term WMDs, it was shit like yellow cake, and the constant implications, and outright statements that the Iraqi govt had nuclear and/or radiological weapons programs that posed an actual threat",

        "text": "I marched against the war prior to invasion in Belfast 2003. I was absolutely shattered mentally. I and everyone I knew had done everything they could possibly think to voice opposition and try to stop it.\n\nBut long before the day of invasion it had become quite clear that this had absolutely nothing to do with the UN  reports or of sending in more inspectors to find the truth as a sort of justification. The UK's attorney generals  position was that it required a second UN resolution for our war to to be legal, there was absolutely no grounds on the basis of regime change.\n\nBut the inevitability was obvious, Bush and Blair displayed an absolute unified conviction. If Bush was going in, then we certainly were.\n\nI cried for hours when \"shock and awe\" started, I felt the most helpless in my life. My country was illegally going to war with people on the other side of the globe, they had done nothing to hurt me and my family, or the UK in any way for that matter. I knew the vast loss of innocent lives to come, let alone the years following complete devastation of infrastructure.\n\nI've spoken to many Iraqis since then and their stories break my heart. During occupation the absolute casual brutality of  US marines and army is hard to imagine. They utterly terrorised the local populace, proudly declaring their racism and bigotry.\n\nThere was one Iraqi who was a kid at the time. He described how the local US military base would at any time raid an entire area and demand that every single person come to the door and raise their hands as anyone hiding is considered a hostile threat.\n\nHis uncle had a disability that made navigating stairs difficult and slow. As they started the raid the uncle was sitting alone on the other side of the house. He was a child and his mum made him hide in a cupboard at the top of the stairs to protect him from these American barbarians. But he started panicking and making noise, so a US soldier shot into that cupboard door. It thankfully missed him, but it passed through into the other room and killed his uncle.\n\nThe US soldiers had absolutely no remorse and said it was entirely his own fault as they had explicitly told them to come to the door with arms raised. I cried my eyes out speaking to him, the worst thing is he blamed himself throughout adolescence since it was only because he made noise his uncle died. What an unimaginable thing to be done to a child.\n\nAnother guy mentioned how his cousin or uncle one day was driving as normal, but the US humvees as operational practice just speared across the roads and traffic pushing other cars out of the way. His relation drove through a blind intersection where one of these Humvees was coming ploughing through with him suddenly being about to crash. The Americans immediately opened fire, absolutely ravaging the car with 50cal and other rounds. They justified it on the basis that he drove with the same suspicious behaviour as a car bomber.\n\nWhat really horrifies me to this day is that the US still treats these soldiers as heroes, thanking them for their service. When a single US soldier died it heralded a great ceremony on the injustice of their young hero being murdered by freedom hating terrorists. I don't remember a single time where they gave remembrance for the dead Iraqis. I never hear of stories like I recounted being told in the US, taking recognition of the routine horrific war crimes their military committed.\n\nI haven't met any Iraqis who lived in British occupied territory like Basra, so I can't pass similar judgement on their behaviour. But one thing is for sure, the soldiers coming back to the UK weren't heralded as heroes. The Iraq war protests were the largest in all of British history, it had massive public opposition. We don't thank them for their service, they didn't make the UK safer or prevent weapons of mass destruction. They weren't the good guys delivering freedom to Iraq.\n\nI am to the bottom of my soul sorry for what my country did to yours. I tried my best, but I always think wasn't there something more I could have done that would have stopped the madness? I'm unapologetically sorry for the trauma and death you and your family suffered. I wish whatever improbable perfect future possibility  for Iraq becomes reality.",

He wanted him to know exactly what he meant, and exactly how he felt about the war and it’s justifications. Hence why it caused a diplomatic crisis: it was a calculated and intentional comment by Joschka Fischer speaking to Rumsfeld and tangentially to America’s most jingoist politicians, stating clearly that Germany would not send its soldiers and people to die in an unjust war.",

De-Baathification was particularly absurd because nearly everyone who was competent and educated in Iraq was a member of the Baath Party; you simply had to be a member in order to be in any university-graduated profession or government office. \n\nAnd as you point out, firing the fourth largest military in the world and nearly every competent person is a recipe for insurgency creation. Al-Qaeda Iraq (the antecedent for Islamic State) only began achieving large-scale military victories when former generals in the Iraqi Army (who were unemployed and enraged after De-Baathification) joined al-Qaeda Iraq and directed its forces. De-Baathification directly led to the success of that particular insurgent group.\n\nJust as a counterpoint, when the US overthrew Axis-aligned Italy in WWII, only the most senior fascists were removed, to allow the main part of Italian infrastructure to remain intact. It shows that the US knows how to remove the leadership of a government without targeting all party members and, therefore, removing all competent individuals from governance. Just for some absurd reason, that was not even considered here.",

That's why in law we have different standards (negligence, recklessness, and knowledge). In the case of using Agent Orange in Vietnam, for example, I would argue that the US military was reckless, they simply did not care that the chemical could cause defects and disorders. If there existed a chemical equally as useful as Agent Orange as a defoliant and equally expensive but did not have the hazardous side effects for humans, I find it difficult to believe that the US military would not have used the safer chemical. The US military simply did not value the lives of its servicemembers or the Vietnamese population enough to weaken its military position for those considerations. It's not that they wanted those groups to come to harm, but that they saw all of the result of use as collectively better than none of the result of use.",

The day after it was announced I stood up during morning assembly at my high school and said that the war was certain to go terribly, that a stable democracy couldn't be built through the barrel of a gun and that the lies told to start this war would bite us all in the ass for decades to come. I was bullied relentlessly for the next two years by not only other students, but by the faculty as well. I was called a traitor daily and told repeatedly by adults that I should be drafted, beaten or executed. The bullying only got worse as the war went badly and I had to change schools. I think a lot of the revisionism surrounding the war is related to people desperately trying to avoid feeling shame over the psychotic way they behaved towards others for years. I think a lot of people have fully melted their brains trying to avoid thinking about the behavior they engaged in after 9/11 in what has been a decades long cognitive decline brought on by fully committing to hysterical panic in the aftermath of a terror attack. These people need to be shamed forever.",

So it's unfair to say that Napoleon reinstated slavery, when really France had very little say in its abolition. His actions were more akin to putting down a rebellion post-hoc rather than reversing a profound governmental declaration.\n\nReally, Haiti abolished slavery and France simply took credit.

        "text": "@devonmolina5200 I don't debate the book's literary quality or even that its worth reading. And you're right, Roberts does criticize Napoleon at multiple points. But I don't think that contradicts my point. With a doorstop biography, there's inevitably going to be a mix of positive and negative actions/character traits laid out (if you go through even as critical a biography as The Power Broker, you'll find any number of complementary comments that Caro makes about Robert Moses' actions and personality). What ultimately matters is the general thrust of the book, the impression that it aims to leave the reader with. This is admittedly somewhat subjective, but it can be fairly assessed by what actions are emphasized and what actions are de-emphasized. Which facts are seen as being of ultimate importance to understanding the meaning of a historical figure and which facts aren't. I've become increasingly critical of Zinn's People's History since I first read it in high school, but he makes this point well in the introduction to the book where he analyzes a popular biography of Christopher Columbus that was published in the 60s or 70s. Zinn points out that in the Columbus book, the author doesn't lie or obfuscate when it comes to Columbus' brutal treatment of the natives; the author even uses the word \"genocide\". But the author emphasizes other aspects of Columbus' life and concludes \"He had his faults and defects, but they were largely the defects of the qualities that made him great... There was no flaw, no dark side to the most essential of his qualities--his seamanship\". \n\nAndrews is critical of Napoleon at various points in his book, but the central thrust is that Napoleon was a  (capital G) Great Man who should be admired. Andrews said as much many times in public speeches, including an Intelligence Squared debate I just pulled up where he said \"The central point about Napoleon is the way in which he saved France.\" I would disagree that he saved France, but I feel like the Haitians, the victims of Napoleon's ultimately genocidal attempt to reinstate slavery, would disagree that that was the Central Point.",

The actions of the slaves themselves and military necessity to a large degree forced the hand of first Sonthonax and then the National Convention. (Similar things could be said about Lincoln and the Republican congress' abolition of Slavery in the US, by the way.) But I think it would be a mistake to become too cynical about this action. If abolition was a mere grudging concession to facts on the ground, they could have limited abolition to Haiti. Instead they abolished slavery throughout the entire empire, thus emancipating hundreds of thousands of slaves in colonies where they maintained firm control. Now, was this done purely out of high-mided altruism? Of course not. This may be apocryphal, but after the vote Danton was quoted as saying something to the effect of \"now the british are finished!\" Along with idealism, there were larger geopolitical concerns about control in the Carribean. But the fact remains that the then-legitimate government of France abolished slavery throughout the empire. And if this had been generally seen as some wild-eyed utopian scheme carried out at gunpoint by the Jacobins, then one would think that the conservative Thermadorians who took power in 1794 and set up the Directory in 1795 would have reversed course. But the conservative republicans of the Directory did not reverse on abolition. That would not happen until Napoleon took absolute power.",

Their objectives were way more ambitious than seizing control of Iraq's oil.\n\nAs for your example of Africa, have you *seen* the imperialisms China has been doing there? Are you keeping up with that? Don't tell me the nations of the world don't care about Africa. Heck, before Ukraine, Russia was trying to get in on that too.\n\nMaybe you need to do more research on what's going on in the world, you're clearly not keeping up.

        "text": "I know a lot of leftists, especially in America, like to criticize the military and anyone associated with it any time they get the chance but that is not a good attitude to have. Yes, the US military is used as a tool of imperialism and mainstream American culture is very militaristic, and I think this strong support for the military is why a lot of leftists try to distance themselves by overcompensating and attacking anything related to the military, but that doesn't means it's a good idea to call every veteran you see a baby killer (especially veterans who admit the US military is unjust and try to support leftist ideas). One of the big advantages the left has over the right is that we are (or at least are supposed to be) more accepting. People can change and when they do they need to find a new group that welcomes them. When veterans realize what they did was wrong and try to change and join the left they need to be brought in and educated or else they will just return to the right because they are the only group willing to accept them. \n\nI know the justification a lot of leftists have for rejecting veterans is that they voluntarily joined the military but I think that is vastly underestimating the amount of propaganda in American culture. I don't think manufactured consent is real consent and even if they did agree with it at the time later they may have realized their mistake, people change. I don't think everybody who has done something wrong should be permanently excluded regardless of how much they have tried to change later in their life, especially since we have all made mistakes and believed things that turned out to be wrong. In fact, people who were once on the other side are a valuable resource since they understand the other side's perspective and can help bring more people over. They were used as pawns by the politicians who pushed this war and are simultaneously perpetuators and victims of this unjust war. I think a lot of the people in this thread should talk to some leftists who used to be in the military, the subreddit r/SocialistRA and Beau of the fifth column's Youtube channel are good places to start, and remember the phrase \"be hard on systems but soft on people.\"",
