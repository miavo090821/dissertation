        "text": "@GMN360 It wasn't that long ago the Halifax was literally trying to get customers, or I should say at that time, members, to leave them. Back in the early 90's I got a job with a 5hr+ round bus trip so really needed a car to cut that down by half. I'd worked there over a year, very secure job at that point, so went to the then building society that my first employer opened an account with for me, the Halifax. I'd never been in the red and while I was fairly young then my savings usually hovered at over a grand. So I asked to borrow 1200 quid to buy a used car. They took an hour, I assume to annoy me even more, to tell me no, but they'd change their mind if I had at least 1500 quid savings.  My savings were nearly that at the time and my salary was enough that within 2 years of this I bought a house, within 10 years of this owning it mortgage free so not like I was a risky borrower and for such a pittance too. Within weeks of this decision they told members that they'd start charging anyone with less than, I wanna say a grand, been a while, in their account. You read it right, they would charge people who had money in the bank for the privilege of transacting on their own cash! How many left them due to this, which was obviously their intent, what else could it have been.\n\nTurned out that about a year or so later they stopped being a building society so had to pay members whose accounts were in the black. Clearly then, they deliberately incentivised people to take their small accounts elsewhere and clearly this profited the big money involved in buying shares.\n\nRefused anything to do with them since. And they want people to believe they are morally unassailable to come down on the woke cult side? Well, yes, I can believe that a money grubbing, dishonest corporation is virtue signalling for woke cult ideology, suits them perfectly.\n\nTo add to the tale if anyone is not too bored yet, Yorkshire Bank, who I'd never had dealings with before and didn't have an account with took 10 mins to give me a loan for 2500 quid (I asked for more, got a better car). Told them exactly what happened at the Halifax up front too, wanted to expedite it all rather than waste another hr and when they checked my credit rating they were gobsmacked I'd been refused.\n\nThen, some years later, I discovered my morally repugnant woke brother was showing off because he'd managed to borrow over 60k (all he admitted to, before discovering what I thought of him for it but I suspect he took more), mostly from Halifax, with no intention of paying it back. I see, once the pay outs weren't an issue they went to excessive lending that helped create the banking crisis. Just before he and his wife used some scheme to avoid the debt (which they incessantly complained about, as well as the state the UK was in due to the bank bailout, despite being let off the vast bulk of what they owed and despite their thievery helped create the banking crisis) they spent another 5k on a holiday, over 1k of which went on holiday clothes, ramping their debt up even more because immoral people take as much advantage as they can, don't they. What's worse, the Halifax let them borrow even more, why not when they obviously expected taxpayers to bail them out of any loses back then.\n\nSocialism suits banks so well, think of all the advantages underwritten by a nanny state who would never let them sink.\n\nI can only hope everyone calls them on their ultimatum, woke customers is what they deserve, no one else.",

People who wrongly transition do not make real trans people look bad, they make their doctors look bad. \n\nIt also doesn't help that there are trans people crusading against the truscum and insisting that dysphoria isn't necessary to be trans, or isn't real, or that \"gender euphoria\" is more important, although these people are in no position to criticize, IMO",

Mousey, shy, artsy, long hair, etc. So I often wondered \"I should have been born a girl.\"\n\nAs I got older, I got more into Stereotypical Male hobbies. I hunt, fish, I did 2 combat tours in Afghanistan, and work on cars, I do carpentry, etc etc. I also still have long hair, that I braid, I sew, and tailor most of my own clothes, I'll take a glass of red wine over a beer any day, and still do art and other \"Female hobbies\".\n\nMy depression / confusion went away when I *stopped* listening to other people and just accepted myself for who I am. A straight man, who happens to enjoy some girly hobbies. Which is perfectly OK. Just like it's perfectly fine, for a Tom Boy, girl, to like Sports, and other male activities. It doesn't make them a man, they just like stereotypical male Hobbies.\n\nTom boys, in general, are more accepted than feminine men, though.

Because one of the things that she evidenced was that Parents who disagreed, had no say in what their children were doing, nor any sway over other adults who encouraged these children. In fact what a large amount of these parents faced was if you don't support your child's choice you are literally wishing death on them and they need to cut you out their life. I say this only because, I am sure that there are many parents who do not want this for their children, but lack support to help their children appropriately. I have also suggest before that if you want to look for blame in this then follow the money. Because I guarantee there are individuals ( shareholders) , big pharma and Dr's who are making a literal killing on producing the drugs ( which surprise, surprise you need to take for a lifetime) and providing the surgery and I believe once surgery is done it's good luck and get to f&(k  if you have any problems. But I do agree that some parents run at this with there arms open wide and god help their children. Liked your bit about Emos and Goths as I'm a little older than you I will add Punks. It was a great time to be young.",

I don't have gender dysphoria, but I was suffering from depression over an emotionally abusive relationship and I wanted to \"shut myself off\" so to speak. What I discovered rather quickly was that shutting down the male reproductive system is basically like shutting down the entire male body. Our regular health is very much tied to our sexual health for better or for worse. Messing with hormones weakens the immune system GREATLY. It messes with bone structure, mental health, and almost every function of the male body you can think of. Promoting such an unhealthy activity as \"medicine\" is downright disgusting, and I thank God I did my homework and got better.",

I’m convinced depression is natures way of telling us we are miserable so that we change our circumstances, and trying to treat it like a disease encourages people to keep putting up with the circumstances making us miserable.

Many therapists kept affirming her desire, my parents even took her to see dr. levin (yes, the Rachel Levine serving as secretary of health) who not even more than 20 minutes of talking to my sister and parents was adamant she transition. \n\nSince then, she’s been on hormones, had a double mastectomy, and now got a hysterectomy. She will never have children (she didn’t want them, but the option is forever gone now), and the WORST Part is all of the severe health issues she’s having now, literally peeing blood and doctors have pulled her from the hormones only because they HAVE to. My parents are still disillusioned thinking this was all a good thing, but my sister is no better mentally, will forever be dependent on my parents not able to function in normal society, and will die young. This is not ok. Every single medical “professional” they consulted should be stripped of their license.",

        "text": "Guess I should update after a year. So things have remained the same. I love my sister and it's been uncomfortable every time my family talks about her because they have rose-tinted glasses on. She's moved out with her boyfriend, and I think her boyfriend's a very nice guy, is actually a good influence, but to this day my sister does not give me the impression of being healthy psychologically or physically.\n\nMy biggest thing is that her overall quality of life is and has been for a while, severely unhealthy. When you have a God-shaped hole in your heart, whether you're religious or not, something will fill it and gender identity is taking that place I believe. I grieve for the loss of my sister. I am about to have a baby, she has never reached out to me once. I will not lie to my child about my sister either, but I don't even think my sister would have any desire to be around my kid anyways. And to this, yes, I've called and tried to talk with her (never bringing up gender or anything, just trying to talk about her life and ask how she's doing, talk about what's going on) and maybe I just haven't tried hard enough, but when I stopped calling, she never called me.\n\nSo I do firmly believe this gender/queer ideology is designed to rip families apart and take advantage of vulnerable children. I have a younger brother who I have a great relationship with who's echoed some of my concerns and has had to grieve in his own way over what this did to our family and to his own childhood. So this always affects more people than one may realize.\n\nAnyways, if you read all this, thanks. Bless you and your family, and I hope you never have to experience this in your own life.",

I had to scientifically dissect the plot to ensure myself it could not happen in real life because humans have planety of microorganisms on and inside their bodies, so if the main character´s DNA got merged with the fly´s DNA it would also got merged with DNA of many microorganisms and the result would be some giant funny looking bacteria.

Or because they never really understood what being christian meant.\nThe case doesnt apply to transsexuality because you cant really prove if a person had 'gender dysphoria' or not, therefore you just have to take their word for it, and even then, these people are not \"tarnishing\" the image of the community, because you cant trash what had always been trashed since the beginning. Exposing would be a more apt word, in this case.",

    "text": "I can't speak for what path Tulip there took, but when I transitioned years ago, and others my age...it was a very lengthy, in depth process requiring years of gender therapy. In depth discussion of pros/cons, what to expect, what will change, what won't, able to soundly deal and recognize what won't change and what you won't experience...that there are still differences between you as a transperson and the biological gender you transition to. And the therapy was very in depth and exhaustive to explore any other possible causes or underlying issues that would be causing gender dysphoria. After that, and years of living as the opposite gender, then you got a letter of recommendation from a therapist to start HRT. For surgeries, it was a longer wait and needing two letters of approval from therapists confirming that transitioning would be the past path to treat dysphoria AFTER exhausting all other venues.\n\nRemoving that process has had devastating results. Its not about your sexuality, or what colors or activities you enjoy, it goes so much deeper than that. This new generation of therapists don't recognize that. The new generation of teachers ignore it. These kids don't understand it and treat it like a choice in an attempt to fit in and be edgy and special. Ever since trans became a trend, self deletion rates have sky rocketed. For the last few years my support group has seen an influx of detransitioners, all of them under 26 years old. Either they came to the conclusion they were trans due to teacher/parent/peer pressure and online forums, or their therapists, if they saw one, didn't try to explore other causes. A lot of teens going through puberty experience body dysphoria, which is completely different from gender dysphoria, but nowadays the two are lumped together. These detransitioners aren't told the whole truth, or what to expect, or what it really means to transition.\n\nGender and sexuality need to stay the fuck out of schools. Its playing with fire and setting kids up to ruin their lives trying to be part of the in crowd. For years now, books and documentaries about detransitioners and their regrets, their stories have been banned and not carried in stores. Try to raise awareness and get told you have internalized transphobia. As if.",

        "text": "I acctually grew out of my desire to transition. Back when i was younger there was no treatments such as puberty blockers etc. I started to feel that i was supposed to be a girl already around the age of 7-8 and the school counselor sent me to a child psychologist. This woman i talked to was 100% sure i had gender dysphoria, which meant she got my parents involved. So both my psychologist and my parents was on board encouraging these ideas i had, I don't blame my parents since they where just supportive and didn't know better at the time. The doctor told them I had gender dysphoria and they felt it was best to listen to her. Until about the age of 15 i was quite androgynous and identified a a girl. \n\nI started attending a boarding school the same year as i turned 16. Puberty had hit it's high point, which at first made me feel devastated. Since i had left my old town, everyone who gave me both security and misery was gone. Which opened up a chance for me to get some new perspectives, hanging out with new friends helped me develop more confidence and as a result i started to feel comfortable just being a feminine guy. Then a few years later(21) my girlfriend became pregnant and that experience changed me alot. These days I'm pretty much a ordinary cis-male.\n\nI agree that time is needed, since alot of things change as we grow up.",

WHich in most cases dosesn't have anything to do with gender=sex - more like expressing yourself, being atractive for yourself and other people. It is rare that someone really wants to live as opposite gender - for the rest of your life - knowing the possibilites of medecine. \n\nThe problem is in my opinion with no proper healthcare not informing patients, assuming that everyone has gender dysphoria 😱 givig hormones and blocker too fast. But even for gender dysphoria to actually diagnose it it needs a lot therapy sessions to exclude other things, and - hormones and body changes should be last thing that they use - if they can't get you out it with therapy. \n\nIn my case - I am after - literally years of sessions with sexuologist, psychiatrist - and they couldn't got me out of it so the decission was to get on hormones -  I am still careful. I was honest with my doctor ( which I think not all the patiets are - or they just don't do tehrapy sessions) that don't give a fuck about gender and social perception - I just want to live in body that don't makes me cry. In my case is not about complexes, I do not consider my body not atractive - just not matching, foreign. But really is different fo every person - THAT IS WHY THE THERAPY IS SO IMPORTANT.\nI really thought I could get out of it, but years of therapy - made me more and more misrable.\n\nBut I have great doctor - sexologist, who informed me about EVERYTHING that can happen after hormones and after. You should know it from your doctor not Internet. 😱😰😨 \nI am really sorry for those people, who need to detrasition - felt their mistakes, but scenario why is repeating - not going to therapy ( or they do not get diagnose properly), not asking the doctors, or nor getting proper information.\nStill I think a lot has to do with using your brain and be careful.

Of course it is less or more important for particular person, if they make an effort to look as opposite sex, so they want respond to be accurate.\nBut it is not all, it is not about how people perceive you, but how you see yourself.

Long story short, after years of tests, they concluded that I would never have children of my own and I was put on hormone replacement therapy such as estrogen and progesterone. I had breast implants and later on once I was married, my husband and I using his sperm had in vitro fertilization using his sperm and donor eggs. But I want people to know that I was never able to breast-feed and that’s important for a mother and I never was trans, this was because of natural hormone blockers that just happened in my body from nature this wasn’t from suppressive hormone blockers.

It’s true- there are people who don’t acknowledge boundaries and don’t respect that other people have every right to reject their fetishes. In regard to some of the transgender activists including professionals who are pushing transgender ideologies- some of them are fetishists who are pushing it on anyone they can. But I would be careful about broad stroking. It’s no different than claiming all white people are racist or all black people are criminals.",

The First Clinic had medical students working there; the Second, midwives. The First Clinic had a mortality fate infamously high that women begged on their knees not to be admitted there.\n\nLong story short, Simmelweis figured out the medical students weren’t washing their hands after autopsies and would examine the pregnant women while contaminated. After he started making the students wash their hands, the mortality rate went down.\n\nHow was he rewarded? He was mocked by his scientific/medical peers who hadn’t germ theory at the time.\n\nMedicine and science has many scenarios where false theories were accepted as facts and anyone who went against the accepted “science” was ignored, ostracized and/or ridiculed. This transition stuff will likely be yet another case study for future scientists and doctors of tragic, incorrect theories.",

    "text": "I went to Soren’s thread (and as a woman with breasts… that’s a horror show) and read the email thread she had with her clinic and honestly it’s not even far outside of the standards of medical care I’ve received.\n\nI have a baby and am on a lot of mom forums. My baby has never been sick but I’ve seen moms dismissed when their babies turned out to have MENINGITIS, which can be fatal even if they were a couple of hours too late. You can die very quickly. These moms disregarded medical advice and took their babies to the ER where the meningitis was discovered. \n\nAnd as for me, I was put on my famous ADHD doctor’s drug regimen. Despite reporting suicidal ideation (I almost jumped into the subway) and depressive symptoms, he told me to just push through because he published several papers about this drug regimen, and I got the feeling he just wanted to file me away as another successful case. It’s like YEAH, the drug may take months to work. But jumping into the subway takes SECONDS. Is it really worth risking? Surely being able to finish a homework assignment in five hours instead of ten is not worth my life? I had to save myself and I refused to take a single other dose of this drug. \n\nHere’s a blurb about strattera. The side effect is not unknown.\n\n“The Centre for Adverse Reactions Monitoring (CARM) has received a report of suicidal ideation in a patient taking atomoxetine. The patient experienced gradual onset of symptoms over the first six weeks of treatment, starting with tearfulness and increasing to self-harming and suicidal ideation. The patient recovered after atomoxetine was stopped.\n\nSuicidal ideation was observed in clinical trials in children and adolescents (5/357 in the Strattera group compared to 0/851 in the placebo group). There was one report of suicidal behaviour in the Strattera group. All patients being treated with Strattera should be observed for emergence of suicidal thoughts or behaviours, especially during the initial few months of treatment or at times of dose change.\n\nFamilies and caregivers of children and adolescents being treated with Strattera should be informed of the need to monitor these patients for emergence of suicidal thoughts or behaviours that may include signs of agitation, irritability or unusual changes of behaviour. If any of these symptoms develop, medical advice should be sought immediately.”\n\nSadly, a lot of doctors are just psychopaths who think we’re all stupid. They would rather you die than take up a second of their time.",

I also have ADHD and haven't been medicated in like 15yrs but honestly idk if I want to get medicated or not cause now I feel like I have gotten so in tune with its quirks and stuff and maximizing the times when  my brain works real good (I love electronics and mechanics of stuff) like I learn in a much better way than normal people well.. much quicker literally see someone do something in front of me and I can do it just the same. I feel like meds would not let me be able to do that as well as it dulls me down? I remember not wanting to do anything but sit there when I was on Zoloft as a kid. I'd rather have the occasional ADHD meltdown vs being a zombie/depressed 24/7. I think the keyto success in ADHD for many is learning and working with what you got for the most part.! How to ADHD is a good channel on ADHD stuff btw :) you are not broken your brain just works different than the norm and the world isn't set up for people like us",
