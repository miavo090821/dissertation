let's look at the oncoming wave of the transitioners because it will happen it will happen I I think sooner than any of us are expecting because I was expecting maybe 10 to 15 years but it's already starting to come out these stories of starting to become more public and easily accessible uh to the mainstream and there are some that have actually gone viral on Twitter that we'll look at before we go into any of that though there is a recent article for us from Connor Tomlinson that's on on the website it's premium if you've got silver membership you can check out the audio track where he's talking about the academic assault on English literature and I do think the academic sphere is assaulting a lot of things in modern life not just academic literature but also a lot of stuff that's coming out uh just in Social spheres as well because I see a lot of this whole intellectualizing around trans issues as coming from the academic space and I don't think there's really much of an argument against that anyway but moving back on to something that we touched on in that last segment we mentioned that the NHS is quietly removes the word women from its menopause page because not every woman not it's not only women that get menopause there's a God you absolutely bigot and they say and the Daily Mail NHS ditched the term women and women from its menopause guidance despite ministers promising to crack down on woke gender-free language in medical advice and once again ministers proving that they are all bark and no bite because they never actually do anything well specifically Savage Javed as well I think this is like the fifth time or something he's given a speech where he says we must crack down on what career in the NHS it's just like well waiting do we see both of his hands when he's making these speeches or he's got one behind his back with his fingers stop them I swear oh dear oh God yeah last month the NHS digital uh revealed that they'd quietly scrubbed all mention of women from its landing pages for ovarian women womb and cervical cancer as well do you know they're trying to remove women yes poses yes they really are I mean I'm sure that uh prostate can so we'll still have a reference to men for now actually that's a good point double check that for me Jamie bring that up and the move was condemned by Health secretary Savage Javid who said common sense and the right language should be used to give people the best possible care and given that he keeps saying this stuff and nothing ever actually gets done in the direction that he's saying he's either lying to the public and behind it or just completely flaccid and neutered as far as the public officials come for getting the job done that he wants to get done so I don't see why I would trust anybody in the UK government to do anything that they say at this point I know we're getting that British Bill of Rights relatively soon but I don't necessarily know if I trust them to be able to pass something like that in the in the way that would be necessary here but anyway let's just double check it and we can see the page itself this was uh post May 24th 27th because that seems to be when they actually did change the page if you uh if you scroll down you can see menopause is when your period up due to lower hormone this usually happens between the ages of 45 and 55 because sometimes happen naturally no mention of women anywhere on this page go to the next one and this is May 24th in the very first sentence the menopause is when a woman stops having periods and is no longer able to get pregnant naturally and this sort of stuff is actually relatively important because not being able to Define which sex it's happening to like the menopause on a biological basis of yes this happens to women did you know knowledge is important in medicine I know I know who would have thought but it really does make the issue quite confusing for people if someone's you know nowadays if you're 13 years old and you're a girl and you're going through all of these changes and you want to know what you can expect going into the future you might drop on the menopause page on the NHS website and think oh it must happen to boys as well just to answer your question prostate cancer does have mentions of the word men oh my goodness so at least young boys are getting appropriate warning of what might happen to them in the future and and of course we've got because it's been pride month we've had every single company bowing down to the regime to let them know that yes they do have the correct opinions and this is where the most recent thing that came out which was Halifax the bank tweeted out pronouns Mata hashtag it's a people thing uh with this image of Gemma she her hers and I'm sure if we were able to get a zoomed out image I would be able to have told you what her pronouns are without needing them specified on the name badge and also the whole point of the name badges I now know your name I can refer to you by name if I so choose I'd rather not it's yes you actually use someone's name if they've got a name badge like in a bank or a restaurant I don't even I don't say the name I don't use pronouns I speak in very short cut off sentences to say can I get this please I just want to deposit this money can I thank you yeah I don't need to say Gemma at any point yeah exactly but if you uh but apparently this is important and some people pushed back against this in the next one if you scroll up here we can see that somebody was talking to them it does nothing of the sort you know uh there's no ambiguity about the name Gemma obviously it's a woman I'm talking to and then Halifax just responds you know saying pronouns matter but apparently customers don't matter uh because they say we strive for inclusion equality and quite simply in doing what's right if you disagree with our values you're welcome to close your account this is not going to win loyalty with customers if you say if you disagree with us politically just piss off I mean it's a daring business tactic I mean we joked about it yesterday it was just like for inclusion we'll exclude you that that is what it always is and of course we need to take a look at the Harwood hot take because the man is a bad take machine I don't understand why how how would you do the Tom hardwood voice I don't understand anyone would be annoyed by people voluntarily adding their pronouns to name badges or email signatures this sounds like he's like this is also my H bomber Guy voice sometimes it's genuinely useful no it's not Tom unless the person that you're talking to is an obvious ideologue in which case they typically have visual indicators that shut light up like a neon sign from a mile away they've got the nose piercings they've got the multi-colored hair they're probably wearing dungarees in the middle of summer like some kind of farmyard hick you can pretty much guarantee if you run into someone on the street or in a shop that this middle-aged obvious this woman is a woman to be fair I do agree with him in one aspect though oh yeah sometimes it is genuinely useful I mean whenever you get an email or business card with someone with you know pronouns on it asking if you'd like to pay money for them it's just like huh no you're and then you move on I mean I don't know if you've had that experience it just kind of gives us business now I won't do business with you actually that's the thing it's why uh trust you with mine this is this is my answer to why anyone would be annoyed by people adding their pronouns to these things which is it's a display of political partisanship but also just intellectually lazy or weak because no normal person would do this as well well that's the thing but that display of political partisanship it's why people get so annoyed and make the argument oh pronouns in bio isn't a real argument yes it is because from the very fact that you are feeling the necessity to put your pronouns in your bio tells me a lot about the rest of your opinions on reality and your uh probably your general personality in general and it's very it's very interesting that it is the display of political partnership that I can deduce so so much purely from whether you feel the need to display your pronouns publicly or not and also just pretends like we can't tell like it's the whole like who are you going to believe the badge or your own Lying Eyes so that's why people would uh get a little bit annoyed Tom not that you'll listen uh and then we've got Disney using uh trans iconography in this uh new advertisement for the Baymax show which I'm sure will be on Disney plus this is all just part of their not so secret gay agenda let's just play the clip so you can get a measure of this [Music] excuse me which of these products would you recommend oh um I um well well tampons I usually use thank you they're more comfortable for me I always get the ones with wings thank you get them scented and bleach free if you can see yo my daughter loves these thank you these might be easier if it's our first period these are really environmentally friendly yep Chris rufo shared that out of course I think that's what I'm looking for that was that was a leak I wonder I wonder where was Wally in that image of course it was the person with the beating on and the massive trans flag emblazoned on his question mark so that's a bit it's a bit funny because like all the ladies there were saying you know this is for her period right which um no this is for his period apparently I mean come on I know my girlfriend when we're in an argument will occasionally accuse me of being on a period if I'm getting particularly flustered about something but I've never felt the need to go out and shop for for it just in case you know I just saw it to be honest I don't know why uh Chris is upset about this is kind of bass because all the women in the shop are like yeah this is for women like not playing into the nonsense at all well yeah but the point is it's supposed to be trying to normalize this whole idea and plus they are explicitly showing the trans flag it is it is quite Insidious and I'm pretty sure actually the Disney have used that same character model before in different shows or at least one that looks very very similar uh to denote just this is a man so it's actually providing kids not only with his the political partisanship for you it's also distorting their view on what a trans man would actually look like I mean I'm sure people might disagree a little bit more if they threw in Elliot page it might display a different kind of character to trans men as they actually are in real life mostly I don't know because I'm not familiar with the show but I just I actually find it funny I don't know why people are picking up on the fact that the women are just like yeah these are for your daughter these were great for my daughter I'm just like yeah the women not not anything else which uh presumably the anime who's putting in that trans flag doesn't agree with would agree with the NHS version of the life well potentially but one once again I think the whole idea is yes it's for women but also these women have identified themselves and their daughters as women therefore we can trust because they being women know what a woman is but also you can't judge because a trans man could also be uh looking for tampons for that period which is true but also like a woman yeah there's obviously a woman but anyway and now that we've taken a look at some of that stuff let's take a look at what um if you bring the Twitter back up yeah some of the d-trans stories that have been going around on Twitter recently now this one came out on June 13th I'm saying it like it's a box office uh like a premiere of a film but this person tulip are I believe is a person who transitioned from male to female and then has de-transitioned and he is a moderator for the d-trans Reddit uh d-trans subreddit so he's very sympathetic to those people and he's been through it himself and he posted this thread and shockingly enough it got about 40 000 likes like we can see and it I do find it interesting because normally Twitter tries to censor these things but it seems that people cottoned onto this one before Twitter got the chance to censor because I did see some tweets from people including uh tulip whose real name is Richie I'll just refer to him as Richie Richie was pointing out calling out that Twitter did sort of try and hide this thread from people but it's uh but calling Twitter out seems to have got them to pull back on that um and he also got Mass hate from the online trans Community from this because of course he did and I'm going to read a little bit of this and apologies because these sorts of stories are always pretty harrowing and are always pretty nasty to listen to so apologies if this is uh upsetting to anybody but I think it's important to know about what's going on here so he says I want to tell everyone what they took from us what irreversible really means and what that reality looks like for us meaning the the transitioners I have no sensation in my crotch at all you could stab me with a what knife and I wouldn't know the entire area is numb like it's shell-shocked and unable to comprehend what happened even four years on no one told me that the base area of your penis is left and it can't be removed meaning you're left with a literal in stump inside that twitches when you take a test their own and your libido returns you wake up with morning wood just without the tree and he says I wish this was a joke then there's the act of going to the toilet it takes me about 10 minutes to empty my bladder it's extremely slow painful because it dribbles no matter how much I relax it will then just go all over the entire area leaving me soaked so after cleaning myself up I'll find moments later that my underwear is wet no matter how much I wiped and it slowly dribbles out for the best part of an hour it's awful horrendous thing to go through now I get to the point where I'm de-transitioned and the realization that this is permanent is catching up with me during transition I was obsessive and deeply unwell I cannot believe they were allowed to do this to me even after all of the red flags I wasn't even asked if I wanted to freeze sperm or wanted kids in my obsessive deeply unwell State they just nodded along and didn't tell me the realities what life would be like and when you see the Democrats trying to pass the trend uh transgender Bill of Rights and when you see companies like Disney and Halifax trying to promote this sort of stuff as if it's perfectly normal and as if these surgeries and operations that people go through to affirm their true gender uh are just completely uh completely normal uh no risk no threat of anything happening and then you read something like 100 reversible those are always told 100 reversible if you get that double mastectomy then you'll be able to and then you change your mind you'll be able to grow back your breasts uh will not grow them back but will be able to implant new breasts on you if you uh what was one of them if you have two medic who's just like bonds grow back don't worry yeah yeah if if you go on puberty blockers and decide that you don't want to anymore then it will have no uh permanent or damaging effects even though that they can vastly reduce your um your uh um what's what's the term uh your ability had to have children yeah yeah yeah sorry I've just that word completely slipped my mind for a second there and it can also mean that I think if people go on to puberty blockers past a certain age there is like Studies have shown there's a hundred percent chance that they will later go on to further surgery and further medical procedures so it is very very damaging and this person Richie went through about I think six years overall of waiting lists I don't know if we want to read it out it's just horrible but I just love the message at the end it's just F everyone who let this happen I mean fair enough yeah and uh he has been approached by a number of people to interviews I think he's decided to stop doing interviews now because it's getting a bit much for him especially with the mass hate that he was getting yeah the thread got Mass reported so he says I didn't delete anything by the way because there are a few tweets that were deleted thread got Mash reported meaning that people just went in and tried to hide yeah the trans community and the trans activists who of course love everybody and don't want any hate for anybody Mass reported this because it goes against the narrative and he has done an interview with the times which if we move to the next one uh we can play a little bit of this clip just to see the mindset that he was in when he started this and also basically how even as an adult in his 20s he got groomed into this so let's take a look I had a lot of mental health issues I was on a high dose of ssris for anxiety and depression and I just became I would say like overtaken by this idea and I was very obsessed with it and it just kind of came out of nowhere I remember reading it online about gender dysphoria and I went on to these um internet forums or chat rooms in 2013 2014 and the kind of like diagnose each other but it's run by like much older men who I don't know I don't want to disrespect anyone but it seemed like they really wanted me to transition more than I did and um it was it was very much do or die you have to do this now while young look at me I'm gonna regret it you should do it now because you'll you'll be able to look like a woman no problem and then that just set us on an obsessive Mission but I was very poorly and mentally yeah so if that can happen to somebody who is in uh now their mid to late like I think early to mid 30s so obviously somebody who was classified as an adult when that started happening when they started to get groomed imagine what can happen to your children and he mentions their you know the online forums it was a lot of older men do are you aware of also gynophilia is that one of those people have like a fetish for like chopped off limbs or something uh not chopped off limbs it's where men this is this is what you tend to see in transgender women who are like in their mid 50s and older is men who have a fetish a sexual fetish for being able to see themselves as a woman and therefore will go ahead with the transition this is something that's been studied and when the person who who discovered it did discover it and release the paper on it of course she got massive amounts of hate from the online trans community and I think she got canceled and kicked out of a university but I would not be surprised if on these forums there is some kind of vicarious Auto gynophilia going on where these older men who don't necessarily are who are at this age aren't necessarily able to see themselves as the ideal woman that they want to be get a kind of kick and a thrill out of getting younger people to do it who might be able to look more like the ideal woman in their eyes that's just a theory on my part but I wouldn't be surprised if they're if they are getting some kind of sick thrill out of it because I mean I don't put anything past these kinds of degenerates personally to do this to somebody who is obviously ill very mentally unwell and very unstable and vulnerable you know I'll help that destroying your body yep exactly and then you get the responses from the turds the online trans community on Twitter I just looked through the quote tweets and if you go to this link that I put on here for the Times radio little clip that they got but just go through the quote tweets and see the absolute vitriol and hate that is being spewed at this poor vulnerable man and their uh this Jade for instance who's got the trans slag in her profile picture yeah anime profile picture and we can see right behind there they've got I think a bit of the pride flag and the trans flag behind the anime profile picture so this is all this is all lining up very nicely where are people getting this fast-tracked gender affirming Healthcare that trans people can't get so your life has been ruined give me some of that I mean is what they're saying I have heard the argument Rose of dawn has mentioned it like the waiting list for transitioning it's quite long because the NHS background or not but I imagine this person probably did it long before this so the idea of this uh is impossible also notice right here that they're saying that trans people can't get so what they're doing is excommunicating Richie because if you de-transition that does not mean that you're somebody who was trans race no what they do is it's not that you're no longer part of the trans Community is they frame it as though you were never trans at all how because like I say it's an X complete Edge communication because you are a heretic in the eyes of the almighty Pride Church there's another one uh pointing out oh isn't it funny how it's only ever the ones who regret it who feel that they were fast tracked yes maybe because no amount of waiting time is ever going to be enough for some people who is just going to be a terrible decision no matter the circumstances and then there's this one which I saw primarily because Ash Saka of course retweeted it I feel very sorry for Richie that he regretted transitioning but he was 31 when he consented to the surgery six years after seeking help and four years after going private because of long waiting lists are we seriously saying he was too young to consent to fast-tracked treatment and on that once again I would say maybe the point is that no matter how long this procedure takes there is a high chance that you will end up regressing and either de-transitioning or killing yourself or or sadly both because for a lot of people the initial problems that cause the gender dysphoria have nothing to do with how you feel about your sex your biological sex and a lot to do with other issues maybe home issues maybe just general mental health problems and this is being treated as a fix-all one size fits-all solution but also these sort of stuff you know say you've got problems with the way your body is that's that you know that is the dysphoria right what he ends up as as he described I feel like that's probably going to make you feel more unnatural than what you had before surely it does this is this is what I've seen from a lot of trans people who have even even older uh trans women who are like uh near their near their late 40s I've read an article I think it was in the telegraph or something from this person saying okay when I initially transitioned I still didn't feel any better and I was trying to live up to this standard of I am a woman now and he's still got a piece of your yeah and he realized that it was only when he uh I'll say issue to be respectful uh that when she realized no I'm not a woman I am a trans woman that is something completely different I am separate from Womanhood I am something else that she started to feel better about herself because once again the standards that trans activists and other people put like trans women or women is just setting an unnaturally and unattainably high standard for these people to hit that is going to make them feel worse impossible so it is impossible sorry I can't get over the description he had of the fact that he's still got morning wood in the morning but you know yeah it's horrifying awful it is honestly awful could you imagine trying to be a woman and you think that you know that's you know gonna physically be cut and then you've got that I mean that's just I mean you would feel just I mean I want to say like I feel like an Abomination or something because you've got both at that point yeah that is that is the thing and not to speak of some of the other issues that can come from drilling a hole through the pelvis into the colon for this sort of stuff but I don't know yeah I don't want to go into that any further but just for one last one there was another one that Richie himself did share and this person Sauron is not somebody who is necessarily outside of the leftist sphere you can go on her account and she's still you know she's got Karl Marx although don't scroll too much on this one John because there is some awful pictures in this so please don't scroll too uh too far and I don't want to put everyone who's viewing at home through that right now especially if you might be eating dinner uh because I've already probably curdled your stomach enough but enough to say that even people who are still within the leftist sphere people who still believe in all of this sort of stuff have still got lots of issues with how the medical procedures are handled because this person talks about the double mastectomy that she she had and she got massive bruising blood loss terrible treatment from medical staff people consistently fobbing her off because it's like no that's just normal but you're supposed to bleed like that you're supposed to get all this terrible bruising around where your breasts were don't worry about it and eventually realize okay I'm not actually trans you know she's like oh I still support trans and trans rights and all this sort of stuff but she can at least post that there is some terrible awful uh procedures that go on in this sort of stuff and no Aftercare for these people that they will get you through they will get you through the revolving door and then ignore that you ever existed but once again it is still impressive to me that these stories are starting to get more traction and more visibility in the mainstream public eye than they used to especially on Twitter so I I do honestly believe the d-trans wave is coming and God help everyone involved in this in this business when it does thank you for watching that segment from the
