In 2023 white people got less than 10% of new jobs while representing over 60% of the American population. In general, it's something that happens a lot and atm it's socially accepted and supported by mainstream media. \n\nI am German, so it's an outside perspective, but hate crimes and open racism against white people seems to be a problem, and it seems to be dangerous in America right now. \n\nHere in Germany we have a lot of terrible stabbings. Most are committed by people from outside Germany, especially the middle east. \n\nMost victims are white, so it looks like the motivation also is racism or it's because of their religion, and I hope America sees that and acts so they don't get a simular situation with hundreds of stabbings per year.",

People with schizophrenia often form abstract explanations for patterns they see in their lives and, even divorced from liberal brainwashing, can independently decide something racist like \"because I've had poor service quality from 3 Indian shopkeeps this week the continent of India must hate me for some reason.\" This is an anecdote but still something I've seen in schizophrenics and I don't think people realise how differently they think compared to the average person.\n\nAt face value it's about race, but based on my own experiences I'd say it's proportionate to consider schizophrenia the most critical factor. That doesn't make this suddenly not about race, but I think schizophrenic racism can be taken a little less seriously, at least politically.\n\nPersonally I believe the biggest issue here is the fact that they let someone that unstable out of detainment so often, and I believe that might where race come sin most, because perhaps progressive judges didn't want to be unkind to someone they saw as \"disadvantaged.\"",

Has the insane perpetrator more victim points? Fcking hypocrites. \n\nI know there are tension between us and the US right now, and I totally agree that we have to share responsibility. Europe has to start helping the US military again.\n\nImo Europe should care for Europe, should keep the middle east safe, the baltic and north sea and the northern Atlantic while helping to protect US carriers if possible. Imo the US should be able to focus on the pacific and Asia without worrying about Europe. Many Europeans think the same.\n\nStill, this woman was a real refugee and she trusted America. She escaped a war and thought America would save her life. It's a tragedy. \n\nOfc you can't blame Americans that didn't vote for something like that. F.e. you can't blame viewers of this channel. But you CAN blame the justice system and the crazy activists that support this criminal. \n\nThey could, at least, take it seriously and punish him, maybe even give him to Ukraine or work with Ukraine to figure out what to do but these activists don't care. They spit her, her family, her friends, Ukraine and all law abiding Americans in their face. \n\nWhat they do is wrong and it's good to see how many Americans push back against the crazy activists. There is something going wrong in America and I know that many Americans suffer because of it. Suffer because the justice system protects certain groups. I really hope it will force the authorities to act and to punish that guy.",
