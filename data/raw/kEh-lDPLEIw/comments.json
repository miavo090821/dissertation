Stating that it \"doesn't feel right\" to rank Huey when he was happy to rank Gonzolo, I think, speaks quite loudly. I think most videos I've seen on this channel seems to imply that Marxist-Leninists who are openly queer are also somehow liberals, but i haven't really watched a lot of this channel.",

It's not a coincidence the CIA pushed such lines through the Congress for Cultural Freedom. There is a difference between ideology and identity of an individual, identity politics takes on the former principle, and is dangerous for movements focused on class struggle because it fosters division and sectarianism, which is why the Left is a basket case in the West right now.\n\nMidwestern Marx rejects identity politics but welcomes people of all identities, same with the ACP.
