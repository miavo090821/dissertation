we got uh this whole wild ass party and we got Russell Brand he ain't talked to no [ __ ] yet would you not because you need to pay off my student debt suck my dick and that's what I got to say and Obama got the Norman nation and they smoke Cornell West my [ __ ] was never right again that [ __ ] was never right again like that's like the Auntie Erykah Badu of a [ __ ] [Music] thank you okay well listen I am so glad you wonderful people decided to join me I was looking forward to this because because I had decided I was not having any collaborations of people affair on my show and last I really felt an urge to want to talk to them and when it was announced the Cornell West was running for president under the people's party I taxed each and every one of you individually and all of you gave me some semblance of [ __ ] it's like we must convene surely we must could be because there's so much to unpack this good late night show yeah it was it's giving friends unless um a single what is it Living Single Living Single yeah so away and friend sounds cute to me but if we want to give it a little because I know you know you know I gave Living Single you know that's the whole I even have the show in the Living Single style format on my show anyhow Cornell so Dr Wes okay okay all right um I've listen right I I respect I all the respect is is paid and I J genuinely that's why I hadn't put on nobody's tweet nobody's nothing because I do not have a hot take I just have questions and Explorations that need to be had amongst other like-minded black people different perspectives different things because lots of whys what's going on why the People's Party why do people's party why that but then also I'm like the things when we get to unpacking with the problems with the People's Party I'm like is that also not true of democrat I don't know you know I'm like um you know then I'm like the whole third party thing lots of them like I said lots to impact somebody somebody hit the floor that was the to be honest with you from a philosophical standpoint I'm gonna start like all right all right Mr Lee do you what you put more weight on a firm and Blackness or a gay and white supremacy and then I thought like being keep mistake that's what I thought like what what what what am I more invested in am I more invested in infernal like this or am I more affirmed than being against white supremacy I think that's a very uh simplified distinction to be made but also they're thinking like hey uh Ron Ron the Santa monium in uh in the in the in the Trump trumpy trump they about to they about to they about face you know what I'm saying so I'm thinking of like peep game do I think any white conservatives are going to vote for Dr Cornell West hell no do I think any black conservatives are going to vote hell no do I think any people that would vote for a Democrat or a liberal gonna vote for him yeah but it's like do I want to get caught up in the the horrible [ __ ] ass but the third party type of way from the so I get back to my question again what do I in this in this moment in 2023 what do I think is more Central well let me ask you this okay that question is valid but then I I think it it requires this question what do we think he's doing with just according on West there's Cornell West running for president which does it do if any because last month he wrote a get rid of op-ab saying that Rhonda scientist was a revolutionary it was definitely an L article overall it's not as bad as Ron DeSantis is a revolutionary [Music] not dragging him diplomatically said it he's a sorry yeah yeah I don't get so I watch so I'm about to I have I have tonight for y'all I have a mix of takes from people whose opinions I respect that I've talked to thus far and or watch they [ __ ] and my own opinions so I want to start with this one which is I got mostly from um Dr Jared ball from uh black Power Media and he was basically like Cornell like a lot of like maybe it's that era of like Scholars and academics that like came up in a a different era of like you know what black or Africana studies might have been has like a a fetish for white anglo-centered kind of anything and so I guess for whatever reason he's been aligned with this thing of blink bringing the classical philosophical Arts back into prominence even at the cost of so many uh other bad things in this case what I understand in the article is the uh the classical what do they call it classical um was it classical learning test yeah the classical learning tests instead of the SAT which basically the SAT first off all this [ __ ] is [ __ ] but the s.a.t is [ __ ] in a like it gets a one it's it gets a six out of ten white supremacy score this classical learning test is sounding like a good 9.4 out of 10 white supremacy scores it's absolutely [ __ ] because look who runs it Jeremy Tate and I got smoke for his ass because he I think he from Louisiana he went to LSU whatever the hell listen I'm always have smoked people who come from my state if you want some [ __ ] Jeremy Tate co-wrote that article with Cornell West and I it's fine whatever you're talking about like whatever you as a black man though just because you sit on the board of this organization because I didn't know that so I read the article he sits on the board of that Organization for the classical learning test this is not about education and bringing classical this is not about that though he does and has for many decades Cornell West will tout himself as you know leaning on philosophy leaning on literature leaning on like history and things of that nature to avoid repeating it in the future this is not about that this is about Cornell West this entire thing is about Cornell West this is not about oh we finna stop the Santas because he agrees with this his approach to education is what I got from that article is that he is in some form of agreement with this he's in awe not in agreement and all oh it's so hard for a lot of black folks especially to get on one Accord about Cornell West because he is not somebody that can really be nailed down because his opinions on things his stances on things change as the wind blows it's depending on what's hot in the streets right now where can I fit in and whatnot he has some hard-line senses and what I do believe that he does he is Democratic Socialist I do believe that he does believe in that but I know that that's absolutely clouded by his religious uh affiliation and how he how he feels about certain things but overall his senses change depending on who's running he's supporting somebody this like it's just his he has no hard line stances on things and that's why none of this matters and then it's about it no you know what's crazy yeah no go no go far no to Gabrielle's point like I mean like for me when I saw that man endorse um Jill Stein yeah that was for me like I like I was just like all right because like to be honest this my part in short especially with Cornell West like from political standpoint he reminds me so much and I I know this could get clip Trump so like I want this to get in context but like him and Trump have something very much in common right unconsciously movie hold on because I know hello because your belly get broke down no for real because I mean like no legit just like how Trump went on the whole Bertha thing and really was ready to upend Obama because of what he said at the correspondence dinner same thing born and Obama got the nomination and they snob Cornell West my [ __ ] was never right again that [ __ ] was never right again like that's like the Auntie Erica Badu of a [ __ ] that's ruined my boy he has had a hard on a direct path a tunnel vision for trying to legitimize distance the hubris that comes with being an Academia and being at that level and performing at that level and then being denied what you see to be rightfully yours and entitled to he ain't never been right so this he was an Obama supporter he was a strong Obama supporter too at the time before I would be offended by that do you think they gotta let it go but in no no I'm gonna no he has to let it go it's absurd I'm gonna get through it is then and you didn't invite me well well if not meet at who that's that was advised I'm alive who else and that's one thing that actually reaction to what he lost so he's coming back what what um old boy said he's he's leaving with something okay okay and what I what I see when nobody first hit me with um that Dr Cornell West was running for president I say girl now what like because I was in the movie theater um watching Black Mermaid and I'm like this is crazy see I leave for one second in in the palace is falling down so many Psychopaths that are running for president and I don't think Dr Cornell West is a psychopath me you know a little crazy but I do think that okay he's philosophical if he went to an HBC you would want to anything if you're a black person you've learned about office Dr Cornell West we've known we've celebrated him at some point then you know we got our own thinking and we don't have to agree with everything that he says um love them mean it uh but when you're walking the line of becoming president now we have to look at you different now we got to be like now we gotta dig like I was telling a little late earlier into your closet I don't think we're all ready for what we're about to find out um will it why are you running um how does that benefit us like are you running off of the strength of emotions and like I lost something and like that's all I mean it ain't really you know I'm Dr Cornell West are you running off of that or is there really something that's not I really would love to know but I think that that's going to be have to that's gonna have to be something we see uh as this campaigning starts to grow but I'm so confused because I wanna I wanna love them but already it ain't been 24 hours and no layers sending articles that's having me be like I'm not ready for this no I'm not gonna tell you what it is Rebecca this is a cash grab this is a cash grab foreign get it how you live this is a cash grab okay let me say something the most successful who was the most successful third-party candidate in history exactly and what percentage of the vote did he get this is not about him so I'm sorry Cornell West knows he's not winning this this is not he's not a dumb man by any means Cornell West is not stupid and more to the point my personal theory is he does he has no desire to be president he has no true desire to be president that's not what this is about the most prominent theory is running online via black Twitter is oh he doing this with the boats from Biden I don't believe it's that either I don't believe it's that either yeah yeah I don't believe it's that but I I wonder so okay so my initial when I saw his Coronado last I have a general stance and just show black academics and black leaders and black civil wars you just respect I just leave it you know what I mean I don't I I try to General especially they alive and living let me keep it cute I don't want to think oh you get a little Twitter popping and you think you could come up the side of your neck about you know what I'm saying doctor so I was like I'm not saying nothing I'm gonna chill right and I give the benefit of the doubt so when I first saw people's The People's Party I I had a similar response to after you which was what the [ __ ] is this you know like I literally I was like I literally don't know any like I'm not educated enough on this party to say anything initially so that was my initial thought and then my one of my one of my best friends my white best friend said to me he came out his neck about uh about about a good old Dr Cornell Westwood immediately once a white person says some negative about I'm like my eyes suspicious of the negative thing so I immediately I just miss him I just I just missed because what he said was he was like oh he's [ __ ] crazy he's out here on he wants he just wants Trump to win he wants Trump to win I was like the Liberals are a big mad in the way I wasn't expecting I'm sorry go ahead you didn't expect this you didn't expect it I didn't want to get everybody behind daddy Biden you didn't want them to expect you think you are I don't be paying attention I'm checked out so hard from uh yeah but I couldn't lay off though let me let me no no they went off immediately that's fine they went off immediately you're right I they they were hot and so I was like why is he saying like what the [ __ ] Cornell West and he wants Trump to win and so I thought it was a reductive argument like one of those like oh just because he's running as a third party candidate that's what the inherent offense is which I don't think is the case I think there's a much larger conversation we need to have a third party and what's meaningful and maybe maybe I think there's a I think it is a mistake that people do this if you're gonna run my mentor put it this way it's like we need third party people running in Congress you could probably win that try that out let's get some third-party candidates in Congress first why don't you all want to build from the why does everybody just want to jump on vanity projects at the last minute in the presidential election when [ __ ] is serious that's my problem everybody's just doing it and I feel like this and my mentor made this argument to me RFK right that's that's one of them guys who's running right now right he has like a certain amount of little he has a little bit of numbers in the polls and we don't even know him some irrelevant yeah they have so many damn Canada and they gonna keep running baby until it will fall off exactly everything was like you know these people instead of running like if you were really this is why I don't know it's like I want to give him the benefit of the doubt and not assume it's that you want Trump or some right Wings foolishness although the block don't look too good on the evidence and what you've been recently saying and doing but at the same time I can't I'm like well then what would it be for because you're not then why not run as a Democrat if you were trying to push Biden to the left you know what I mean if you were there to like be like oh this is what it is and his you know his video speech kind of reads like what he's saying does it doesn't sound like he's saying which kind of annoys me more again vanity projects when things are serious is like I'm not trying to run for president he was like I Believe In Justice philosophy and scholarship and these things aren't important they're not at the Forefront right now and I believe that this is a means to keeping this kind of stuff in the conversation so I'm like all right cool you know and issue Canada to some degree right like you want us to care about something to talk about something or you know if you want to push by into the left then go [ __ ] maybe not now and not now not this or run as a dam but why are we running for the People's Party what's talking about in the past so that is still so vague that is so vague here's the thing he has no chance of running this damn he saw what they did to Bernie he is in an offense he he in anybody's cabinet is he is he he feels as though and he said this what was the quote he said that he does not believe he though he is a socialist he is not a Marxist Because he believes his religious beliefs cannot be melded with his uh his personal stance of socialism he believes that but he also believes that the left the current left-leaning party in America needs Jesus and all this so all these different things he just there's no stance there's nothing so I'm gonna tell you I'm gonna give you my Galaxy brain take and again shout out to uh BP at overthrow media and uh Bellamy because people I've chatted up about this and then also just Twitter because I had to do some Twitter because I you know I be on and off left wing Twitter you know they yeah they're an interesting group but you will learn something you may not get it a balance learning experience but you'll pick something up here's my theory that I've gleamed now this is about um The People's Party jumping the line for all other third parties this is about them jumping the line on the Libertarians just about them jumping the line on the green party just about them jumping the line on whomever else so that I think that's true yeah and so because like it's out so the People's Party from out mistaken came up under after Bernie right yeah so you got a lot of you know you got a lot of debate bro energy already no shade to Burnie but like that was a big part of his Coalition and from what I've gained from the people's party like it's a lot of white left this energy up in up them streets I I think it's that I think it is that I think it is the jump the line thing but I think it's also I think it is also this as it pertains to um the founder numerous sources of corroborated sexual harassment allegations against them Nick Rana last year former party member former party member apology and swearengin told journalists somebody Higgins and Jordan Sheridan that she had witnessed Broner try to force himself onto former another party member onto former party executive directors on a day who confirmed the allegations herself numerous partying board members were apparently forced out for encouraging investigations into the allegations and questioning whether Brana was still fit to lead the party after the allegations were made public the party's social media accounts attacked and smeared those questioning the party's leadership actions other former party volunteers and members of accused the party leadership of lacking Democratic organizational processes having opaque finances and being generally disrespectful manifesting sometimes in ableism and racism which by the way they get into a lot on Twitter they they came out recently and said MLK would be anti-woke but I mean like yet again I just want to reiterate isn't this the same time this is quick I'm sorry I know but like hold on like just like this is the same Cornell West that's a quick point of the West that wanted to go on hand and hand buddy buddy up with Jimmy Dore for the People's Party in 2022 it's the same Corner West right donkey Cornell West sorry anyway um this the you said because that is what conservatives do all the time people the Socialist Party said that uh Martin Luther King will be against smoke the People The People's Party their their official Twitter account [Music] and please zoom in in slow motion unconscious just now do that please please hit a slow motion in a freeze break I gotcha have to say fine you're not really fine Cornell West is the one that had the the the the very strong analysis for imperialism in in drones and things like that for Obama right yeah so so and and let's rewind this real fast what the hell he said specifically about Rhonda San Antonio what do you say he said that Rhonda santis is exhibiting the spirit of a revolutionary by changing these [ __ ] standardized tests to include more old white men [Laughter] really that's a pretty fair explanation of this version that's the nicest version I can get that's the new King James right there and hold on what's important is he said it the op ad dropped May 12th he said it correct me if I'm wrong Cornell West sits on the board of that organization and here's something now most of these these education companies and whatnot because I run a non-profit most of these education companies like the people who run the SATs people run the acts and whatnot when you run a nonprofit your board is not supposed to be paid the only people whose boards kind of are still getting paid are these education companies so he's very likely getting a check from being from co-signing this [ __ ] with Jeremy Tate and we're not in the classical learning test nonsense like he's very likely being paid to publicly come out and support this so Dr Cornell West you're saying is actually just using the talking points and if because he's getting it you know it's it's getting money he said it's a cash crash and because he sits on the board um it's like it's a connection so you do this for me I got you kind of thing you don't really have to believe it but just did in the paper say something about it a little bit and then we all win is this what you're telling me is this because today he said today brother West said I thank my dad brother oh God this week Hey Brother [Laughter] I thank my dear brother Russell Brand right now [Applause] Russell Brand yeah yes yes Russell Brand for thank you for providing the stage for my presidential announcement zoom in unconscious again and it's the final hey there's the hook line and Cinco he is a progressive gem exclamation who the same feeling that I had for Kanye where I was like I was just like oh College Dropout oh right now no I'm not saying he's ill I'm saying let him [ __ ] go [ __ ] go let the man do him he's doing it they let him go listen Lauren and when you say let him go are you saying like you know it's a toxic X let him go or are you saying like let him go out there and figure it out and we gonna take him so all right let me play angels Rebecca was like you know we love by the West we've had him on our show me too FAMU we talk about Dr West he's this doctor Cornell doctor Cornell West baby we don't just be out here talking about Cornell Cornell no you know there's a lot of money at the end of the day like I said on my show earlier this morning hey I don't care when you run for president now I gotta look at you different now I gotta really go in and I have to see you for who you are we have to make him say Russell Brown is a progressive gem now come on now everybody so what's up so all right let me get let me let me play Angels advocate for a sec all right all right and let's let's let's go positive for a moment right here's the reality of of who Cornell is in the moment he is this Cycles Bernie Sanders figure and in that regard no matter how much [ __ ] are we we have just went over and how much [ __ ] we will probably have to engage in as we continue to dissect his recent Behavior because I've there's worse [ __ ] that I've heard about be honest with you I don't know if Olay about the game I'm gonna come back to the worst [ __ ] um no I'm not I'm not gonna come back to the worst [ __ ] I'm playing Angels Advocate no FD they finished his role right now is to inject the pot the the the the popular discourse on electoral politics with a more overtly leftist um lens and that's what Bernie did in 2016 and 2020 and wow and while I never was a huge Bernie fan I have to credit the fact that Bernie created such a movement that it pushed a large chunk of Millennials my age and younger which I'm assuming is y'all to re-engage with overtly leftist politics in a way but is it woohoo is it only is it overtly leftist because he says it is because so far I want to know here's my thing just like Rebecca said when you're running for president I gotta look at everything you do I gotta look at everything you've said I know some [ __ ] button said back in 74 I'm still pissed off about let me tell you something you're running for everybody it's hot with it so what exactly was does Dr Cornell West think about about the the surge in Reproductive Rights being taken again taken from women in this country what does he what does he plan to do about that where do you stand on education is he still going all right wait what happened to silence you we don't know because the way that it was cutting out just now but where he stands in that video he dropped out it was giving like I said black exploitation okay I got that feel like listening for the people's body I ain't running for the right and I ain't running for the left I'm like okay so you're not running for the record for the left he did mention um something about black women uh Health he mentioned those things that we know black people are fighting for every day and we know that because of his uh position and and a lot of what he's fought for a lot of what he's uh taught um a lot of his philosophy surrounds that then stuff that we all fight for every day talk about um but it's like okay if you're saying that it's not on you you can't you can't relate to what the right does you can't relate to what the left does because you are um critical of how they move uh so you're running for the people's party but what exactly does that mean I just felt like it was I also in general as another like um more on exploit point I don't know how I feel like even if the let's say the People's Party didn't wasn't riddled of a million [ __ ] reasons why I'd asked not the Barney to be supporting the founder is a rampant sexual abuser all kinds of and foolishness the buffoonery but I said was it I don't know if I in general the guy is some Nick Brown or whoever's around the founder let's say some other person without these allegations it's just some young some somewhere that white guy what is revolutionary about our you know our black like intellectual leaders or whatever it is join in some white guy's party he created in 2017 and ain't done bullshiting what the [ __ ] about that is I don't understand that nobody but me I don't feel like that's given Revolution it's it's not it's not getting a revolution y'all know you know what's about to happen this [ __ ] gonna run you're gonna talk a good game and he gonna endorse biting in October or some [ __ ] being real anti-intellectual and real real lazy from a political standpoint I'm thinking of this speech I heard uh Dr Michael Eric Dyson do when he was talking about some real smooth I heard this [ __ ] not about 17 18 but he said something like I would not allow for my cultural Pride to override the political accountability and it's just like the thing that I'm hearing from all of us right here is my AP game culturally [ __ ] we've been proud of you we didn't heard about you our entire lives because of what you've been able to do for the black tradition in terms of Academia you trying to run for president now I'm talking about politics and I think the political I'm just thinking they're like fam you you the way you fold your leftist legacy ideas with your conservative mumbo jumbo like I sort of Christian mumbo jumbo it really be coming up to me it's like being like real slippery and the more yeah I'll talk more it's like I'm ready I think I'm I'm confident to go full blown yeah you after all these years all these years Dr Cornell West you're gonna link up with Tavis Smiley you've been to come out to the gate with Tavis Smiley doing some radio they both hated Obama though okay they both and like and like and let me be clear let me be clear um I'm gonna put it out there I'm a I was I was a big Obama fan and I remember citing uh being side eye in Cornell when he was going after Obama even though I didn't have a single good argument against what he was saying what what is and so but I also still and I still will hold this this take it was still very much clearly um what's the word uh Petty like it was it was like these big political issues but it also still felt very Petty um that Cornell made that his thing after all them years after he was supporting them and so it makes perfect sense for him to connect to uh Tavis because Tavis that was his movement it don't make sense because it go back to what Olay said why is it homeboy who runs who's founded the People's Party you got all these sexual assault allegations baby PBS fire attack Smiley a year ago sexual assault allegations why is everybody around you on some [ __ ] that's how I know you on some [ __ ] last year and that would and if I just had [ __ ] like that beforehand you know yeah I got him last year for that no it's is it looking good I really thought we were going to be more 50. this is all bad we said be proud of him we are now trying to know okay Who the hell's trying to be president I love that about black people though I really love about how black people literally can decide this is totally okay once you are in this Lane but the minute like you know what I think is so funny everybody knew I literally remember this right my wife because remember there was a time they loved Kamala right even though I know gamble is a goblet but I remembered as my white friend was so excited like Karma's gonna run for president black people I said listen to me the minute she announces she running for president [ __ ] are gonna say that [ __ ] is a cop though it's different you can be like you could be a regular party you could say you switched up as a general politician and be on Twitter and that's real cute now whatever you trying to be the white whale no no people don't click links no way if he's just out there being a public intellectual Reading Writing we didn't even know about that op-ed dropped until now you see what I'm saying so it's like it's fine we have we're not looking into we know who our black intellectuals are we know the reason we're keeping up we know and we're like yo you're fine you're fine carry on carry on smartly it's only when they come in our face with announcements talking about they running for [ __ ] we're like wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait there are two Dementors trying to take on by nuke it already Bailey stay alive like for the White House okay The Block is Hot no maybe not now it just hit me that this whole thing go ahead conscious go ahead and Rebecca I'm sorry I kept you going for breakfast I'll say real quick we're not doing that thing where we're voting we did that with President Obama that was like literally almost 10 years ago right we are not doing that anymore we're only because the person is black no now we're like you black and we learned that from you Dr West yes 2023 so it's like hey that was 15 years ago that was damn near 28 that was close to the 20 years we all out of them passes so so for me I started thinking like man um the the the the more this conversation goes it's like we not no fools exactly and I want to say this in that same vein conscious you are absolutely correct let me tell you something Gabrielle is working for the prosecution okay the green party to show up here today and drag him the green party said guys I am I love to the HBCU people I don't have no affinity for that I don't give a [ __ ] about that man I'm gonna say how it is thing every election cycle black people are blamed for everything if your faith loses black people fall if your fave win but he would still didn't vote hard enough we vote in the 89 percentiles whether we vote more than any other minority demographic but if your favorite wins if your faith didn't win by an acceptable margin no matter what it's black people's fault and I'ma say this we are absolutely like Rebecca said I love what she said about going when once you run you are running for president now we gotta look at everything you said let me tell you something I I'm not with that old black people Gonna Save the soul of the country and all this other kind of nonsense Cornelius is also kind of playing into that where oh the soul of the country has taken whatnot no for me why can't you cater to me why can't you Pander to me the way you Pander to everybody else the way everybody else gets to be pandered to the way you get to be why can't I be a single issue voter why does my vote why does we vote have to be for the greater good and we have to vote autonomously for one person or the whole whole of the Earth's gonna fall apart no I care about certain issues and I want to know what you think about those issues so I am not with that oh I've got movement soul of America we gotta save everybody no no pay off my student debt off my dick and that's what I got to say sorry speaking of this is that at the beginning I really I really I really I feel like it like like like in the same vein of dicks I think that Dr West's been cleaning up with me I just shared a video oh we like Dr West at our show hey Dr West was just cheeking up with Candace Owens talking about no he wasn't no that's not go I and Candace Owens now Candace Owens talking to him and calling you a leftist that is officially the moment where I stop being respectful nowaday hey you know you know you got to know it you you're like hey I got a I got a lot of Grace you know something some things it's like is that a crime you know that could be harm you know what I mean maybe that's a misstep maybe that's a mistake but you said the minute you said Candace Owens the factory in my brain just started opening the doors for disrespect I said okay he debated her last year but not only did it before know where he's already to me either being strategic and trying to appeal to conservative constituents and or he's already getting into a conservative clout chasing Griffin type [ __ ] because what he did to her is legitimize and it's supposed to be real she has some great criticisms for leftists and liberals some of them shits is half of no [ __ ] and half of the good for consciously right for me he he really Justified and gave a lot of credence to damn man all the criticism stores to live you know what I'm saying and there's like actually sister I agree with you when you say this or about what you say about the lift they stopped She Goes to the right and it's like I'm now thinking about this it's like so almost my question would be to almost um hey huh say uncle doctor Uncle Dr West how long has you been thinking about doing this President [ __ ] [Laughter] when you was talking to Candace Owens did you are was you already thinking about it contemplating on being president obvious no no let me say something okay Rebecca you talk because he was trying to say something no no I'm gonna say this it's not that you know it is Dr West right Dr porno Wes but like I said you're not above the criticism that's gonna happen because you want to run for president I would have loved to know like you said conscious when you were sitting there talking to um um oh girl uh Candace did you know that you were running for president and you know like like now I'm starting to look at these things now that you are running I gotta look at you from a different view I gotta look at you from the three now I gotta look at the bones it's falling out your closet we gotta go digging because we need to know who's gonna be a representation it's not because we're black we respect you for everything that you've done you like like Olay said you were in one lane we were like yeah Dr West ain't like that too much but you dropped away it's gonna be like no sir the kids are hungry what are you gonna do about that Women's Health black women specifically what are you gonna do about that as a representation for black people how are you gonna do we got to know that you're not gonna be sitting up there uh as a black representation like Kamala Harris who sitting in that seat and said that America isn't racist but yeah put in what's put something in place for Asians to be protected from harm and hate crime this is what we need to think these are the conversations that we need to know we need to know who you're going to be when you get in that place of leadership as a reference it's becoming abundantly clear the more I think about this that this don't got [ __ ] to do with us thank you this don't got like like especially like as you're talking like I'm thinking like all right so we got in the last 48 hours and last month we got the santis we got uh this whole wild ass party and we got Russell Brand he ain't talked to no [ __ ] yet also brand is like Russell Brand is uh uh one of them both sides ass [ __ ] it's just like you know like I'm okay with criticizing I'm a liberal to be like nice but he definitely wanted them both sides free thinker um hydrochlorican ass [ __ ] you know what I'm saying it's like it's like all right so it's clear where he's going with this and where this party is leading it's it's a they're trying to create a populist leftist movement and I'm not feeling I'm not feeling it at all in your same vein he is just he is in in his Essence a provocateur he's going to a Russell Brand going to a Savage Smiler because he knows that these are people who are not even Charlemagne would at least have a couple questions about this on The Breakfast Club he is going to people who are not going to interrogate this in any real direct way what where do you stand on these issues how do you feel about this how do you plan to combat what do you think about a militarization plan he's not going to people who even if he were to go to if he were serious about this if he if he were to go to one of his Alma models he would go to um Harvard go to Yale announce this there it would give him way more legitimacy way more uh off behind his campaign like hey I'm serious about this he is not looking for legitimacy so I don't so here's the thing though and this is not me disagreeing with you but he's still Dr Cornell West he can talk that [ __ ] and this is what's gonna happen he came he's he right now he he just all alley oops with his white folks oh Russell Brand Ron DeSantis Candice Owens whatever it's all alley-oops when he gets to Charlemagne because you best believe Charlemagne he he is going to he's going to say all the things and he's going to get us he's going to really sin he ain't talking to no [ __ ] yet because he know I'll get to y'all [ __ ] when y'all when I'm ready I'm so sad because I got exactly what y'all want and I don't like that either because especially if you don't think you could win like this is my thing like if you're doing something it's one thing it's one thing in the Obama world when we used to justify we used to my mommy and everybody used to justify Obama not doing stuff for [ __ ] because it was like oh he's in this position where the white people they expected that we dealing with a winner we know we know he knows everybody knows nothing about this nothing about this is the goal set to win regardless of what the reasons are for everything else for running it he knows he's not gonna win that's not the plan so if if your actual agenda was in any way rooted in doing for us and you're not planning to win you're not planning to get that would you not be talking to the [ __ ] talking for the [ __ ] like speaking to those you need to be on uh Steve Harvey reading the Strawberry Letter somewhere you need to be you need to be up here I think I think FB I feel like almost where we can uh uh extend the argument and Analysis to MV made earlier it's just showing that a lot of the people that come from that generation uh that Legacy they still have this desire to be situated amongst whiteness and have a proximity to White yes and this really showing with this political strategy you yes you have all these great criticisms for Democrats and how Democrats treat [ __ ] as being the the afterthought you're doing that right now [ __ ] I'm gonna do that damn yes that's what I'm saying that's real tea like you know exactly the speaker for the black folks he done did some things wrong we was like all right this Dr Cornell West map okay and now look you should have been out the gate with black folks you should have been like you said on Tamron Hall you should have been talking to Simone over there at what MSNBC or wherever she at you should have been talking to them people and here you go he's not ready I got questions but like we we're we're not the norm in in this conversation yeah you know what I'm saying no I know because the shade room no no better and that's what breaks my heart because they no I swear to God it really upset me it really upset me and I seen a couple also don't know nothing [ __ ] encouraging them because they had People's Party in their hair oh independent their body they don't know nothing and they're not gonna look into it it's just like yeah the party is pulling damn the whole this is the [ __ ] Democrats the state Playbook [ __ ] I ain't even beat that initially this is really what it's going down to and that's the reason why it's just the reason why I'm kind of annoyed is just like hey you you've given us a lot of tools to be able to use and you acting like the old school teacher that's now pissed off that you didn't educated the students so much and now you have to be held accountable for the very tools you to talk about a sharp with yeah a swing this goddamn knife but you don't know when I swinging at your ass how to do you see what I'm saying hey hey hey a word Smiley in a lot of those black old-school conservative moderate liberals they really buying into I feel like the alt-right pipeline the alt-right pipeline that's the right apologist yo and to something else you said earlier conscious generational now the culture wars being generational and now Cornell West is literally linking up with people you've been fighting with since I'm 32 years old uh [ __ ] you've been fighting with the [ __ ] 50 years hey you you gotta be for me and Young Folks they got smoke for you and now all of a sudden you were you linked up with a party that said that Martin Luther King would be against the Walt movement yes and and what concerns me right is you say it like you want to give it the bit like I wish that I wish that he was somebody like abiding where I'm like that man not really even alive like he's a zombie like he's always not there but it's Claire he's operating he has all the wear with all and that concerns me if last year you was talked he was chopping it up in Candace uh Candace wins and being like yeah agreeing to criticisms of the laugh because if you doing that that's consistent with you joining a party where they on Twitter criticizing the laughing and I woke and using MLK and stuff like that and that's foolish like I said from my earlier when I'm unimpressed by just fundamentally is this all all black man if you're gonna go do something on your own if you're gonna go do something for purposes and meaning I judge you by what you do like in a sense we build careers we in White America we in white professional spaces we don't get to choose the environment often but when they do our own [ __ ] it says a lot you know what I mean when you have your own metrics and what it is right like I've been a bunch of white people show this is my show first set of collaborations everybody's black that says something to me if you're not trying to win you know what I mean if you're not trying to win and you should be here for for for the community you should be trying to say something that's what you're saying you've always fought for this this is the fight that you want to do what exactly are you teaching us other than to hop out at the last minute to do something that appears to be a vanity project that you have no intention to carry to the fullest you're not giving us any like platform you're not talking directly to us or for us or even about us it seems you linked up with this like brand new baby white party that's run by some like some baby white boy with a bunch of accusations a bunch of sexual assault allegations and a in a public online known persona for being anti the typical things that the black community overwhelmingly supports and votes in favor of so who you here for my guy all right no I don't even think it's that conscious I gotta tell you I don't even think it's that here's the thing I think I do kind of think it's that I do kind of I don't think it's entirely that I am not disagreeing with you entirely but here's the thing I think that that is not entirely his aim as learned and as educated and as incredibly smart at Dr Cornell West is I think that he is from a different generation and he is working by an entirely different Playbook that does not work anymore because the the politics of old demanded that you go and appeal to white folks first because the under the assumption that we're just gonna all us as black people are just going to fall in line whoever's gonna fall in line is going to fall in line that is not the same he's working under the same respectability politics pull yourself up by your bootstrap he also has to contend with the fact probably why he went to Tavis Smiley he always he also has to continue with the fact that the base even oh even other older black people our elders blame young black progressives for the one the state of the party two for how they they are equivocating oh you know all these people out here in the streets and violence and y'all to protest y'all we wouldn't like that back then we wouldn't do all this all that is a symptom of the old Playbook that he has has to contend with that so you're right but it is giving you but unfortunately it's giving new performances sentiments all Playbook sentiments with new performative shortcomings I agree to that but at the same time we can roll just right back to the beginning um when Dr Cornell West as we it's my heart broke um my heart broken to pizza because you guys it just broke as you guys stated that he did um give some kind of accolades to um and and that breaks you because as an educator and in the in the part that he gave him um uh some some debts for us it's literally like about education and you know what that man is doing out there in Florida when it comes to education he is stripping all things black anything black history that was what bloomy do so that that didn't sit well with me and as somebody that we've learned about in our schools and you know I know you went to a pwi since both of y'all but I you know going through an HBCU they literally embedded him as one of the Gods into us like yeah Cornell West and of course you know even going to those schools if there's like a hierarchy there's a sense of royalty and then how you carry yourself there is a conservative space of that of of the way of old um and how to carry yourself but I thought he was like a free thinker right that's the branding yeah I I read I've read some of his work in like seeing some of his speeches and [ __ ] I ain't know I ain't know how he was moving and it's always different between like what your product is and what's your what Your movements are and I'm just out of respect for Cornell West we're gonna have to Cornell West Cornell West yeah yeah foreign Cornell West who's also running but at the same time both of them I you know Kanye out there way out there just out there isolated on an island alone uh but people don't vote for him and and then we have Dr Cornell West who I would have loved to see him come out the gate with like I would have loved to see like if this is a Tyler Perry or this is a Tyler Perry production damn campaign yeah we were drugging for that too let's give it up right but yeah and it would have been fine I'd have been okay with Oprah he doesn't come out with listen my thing is like let me believe that your ideology around it is at least legitimate like it's a problem if I look into it in the most recent op ads I see like present day and it's it is unmistakable the kind of hell that is being rained on across the country when it comes to Banning you know um attacking education Transit all these different things and you mean in this May May 12th that was May three weeks ago hey my guy and you know and and then that made me think and I and this is something I want y'all to stay calm because I wasn't thinking I try not to to to get into too much all taking votes away from but I thought this when my mentor raised it to me is if RFK is able to be polling as well as he is and we don't even know our FK and he's way less popular and you see black people are actually the not black people not black people Twitter black people shade room black people Facebook black people Instagram which are I think they outnumber population and they are here for it and if RFK could get that I do think there might be a legitimate concern and I'm I'm not saying it to be mad at him but I do think there is a legitimate concern that he is able to take away some you know what I mean and I I don't like about it tell me about it tell me your thoughts on that SD I don't think at the end of the day um I don't think the numbers I don't think it's going to be that big a deal the reality is so like like we talking about Facebook shade room but you also gotta I mean are you talking about uh black Facebook black shade room but you gotta remember black church is who gonna vote yeah yeah and they both forbidden and it's it's only going to matter in what four five states and in those four five states the these people got this [ __ ] down to a science they they it's who gonna spend the most money who got the machine going so you know uh that they're not gonna campaign at all in Florida they're gonna campaign their asses off in Georgia they're gonna plug Stacy back in Georgia Louisiana they're gonna hit up the Midwest they probably still gonna get the Midwest if they get the Midwest like I I'm I'm more worried about DeSantis than Trump right now just cause I don't think I was initially but not now yeah well well I'm still you know it's long it's a long track yeah right this [ __ ] Trump be in jail by the time uh I'm more worried about the Santas and Trump because I think the scientist has a better chance of beating Biden in the gym I think so I think the scientists would be Biden but I don't think the scientist is going to be Trump I think Trump is winning numbers he been busting that ass all across the scientist and I did a whole video on this the sentence is a bigger problem to me than Trump because let me tell you why because the scientist is playing by the why I believe he'd beat Biden it's because he's playing by old old America you know what I mean it's very seriously yeah exactly he's not into the theatrics that he play an old politician would they like to get back to but he do any plan to the right they're doing all of the most evil far-right [ __ ] to prove to them like hey I can contend but trust me he's a bigger problem Donald Trump like but I think Trump is going to beat him to be somebody who's only three generations removed from what what was it Italy or whatever the case may be Italian that's why I say Latino yeah but immigration you know you know come on now six folks in your family who can't speak English somewhere they don't care they don't care he doesn't care he wants them non English because Republican too yeah white people did not care about white people so many of the other problems why people care about whiteness the difference yeah absolutely see and you can do that and and Ron Ron was white we know but he he is going to push every extremist white View and get away with it and and the way that he does it as Governor is sickening I'm from Florida and to know all that's happening down there especially in South Florida where it's literally immigrant land and for him to just despise those people in them white Cubans is absolutely eating it up they are loving this computer you know I will vote are they down there doing all kinds of Merengue about down there just like just to make sure that they stay conservative because being a white conservative will always separate them from the rest the darker ones but this is what um Ronald Ronaldo the Santas he is literally down there he is he's trying to make it so much where it's like if you do not look like this if you don't talk like this if you don't walk like this if you don't meet this criteria then we can't serve you and we do not want our children to learn anything but this it's not about the guns this is what we're understanding it's the same thing that's why it's really dangerous it's not about the gun it's about the drag queen and the people are like oh my God he's brilliant no that's fine and that's kind of why so bring it back to like differential point so Florida's a wash right Texas is a wash all these states are washed you know but like the handful of states where um it's uh it's a it's a Battleground state um the the I don't think Cornell will be like able to do anything no Clyburn is going to handle that right and Clyburn and his Network are gonna handle Cornell um probably early as soon as soon as it feels like Cornell is doing too much they're gonna handle that and and considering the baggage that we've uncovered yeah like they're gonna handle it easily they're gonna handle it easily because Cornell if we if we're like really keeping the buck although Cornell has always had love I went to Clark that's almost Instagram so although Cornell has always had a lot of love from like the black academics and the black academic spaces because he's like the the highest like achiever within that Community yeah I never really [ __ ] with [ __ ] yeah Cornell Cornell ain't never really been been like a true like running uh you know he got arrested on purpose right Class Matter a couple of years ago and his hotel to be people it was you know it was Loki a photo one I don't know all the details but I believe we need us he needs anybody running anybody buying anybody they know they need us for the workload but they don't need us for the Optics and that's why the way to the promised land for Cornell West Dr Cornell West has never been to play K for black people it is to be just learn it enough and just outspoken enough about black issues and you have the credibility of the movement that he grew up in and he inherited we all inherit the movement as black people in this country he is not somebody at this point who needs to come to us and be like hey I need y'all we need to do this together that is not where he is he's and he's long been past that yeah yeah yeah how you feeling empty how to round out for you they're my [ __ ] man I was so like I was so excited I was fighting niggles on Twitter for about 15 minutes like no of course when you tweeted I knew it was a right I knew to turn around happen when you tweeted I guess I guess I gotta research the people what I saw what I thought I said me too [ __ ] let me know tweet the minute I saw that I was like I have to take a page at your book and spam myself through that meanwhile I've been calling a bed winch and everything else on Twitter the girl because you know when you come after doctor Cornell West and any of the related folks it's going to be it's it's not going to be good that's why even on my show today I just kind of walked the line where I said well we just gonna have to see you know I'm gonna have to go check out what the People's Party is talking about we're gonna just take a look that may not even be a party that can even win honestly oh General States we're going to look at it though but doctors we're going to keep our eye on you okay if I can go galaxy brain for a second then I'm gonna run and jump on this editing yeah I've been saying for years now that what we're what we're gonna eventually face like this is as scary and ridiculous as Republicans have been they're getting that scary and ridiculous because they're kind of running out of fuel for their politics and movement yeah and I I've been saying that what you're going to eventually see is the Democrats take their appropriate place as the conservative party and something else spring up as the new left and I think this is an example of what is eventually going to happen with the new left because the new left is going to be maybe maybe like on maybe like a couple you know a few notches better than what we've gotten from Democrats like it'd be hard to be that bad right but they still gonna be full of [ __ ] if this is like the type of moves that they're going to come out the gate with if this is the type of ethos they're going to run with because this is definitely a this is definitely like this is [ __ ] Tick Tock it's like let's get the blackest thing we could we have access to get out there do the [ __ ] dance and [ __ ] we know black people gonna come through eventually because he's gonna talk that like he's gonna talk that [ __ ] as soon as it gets on Charlemagne that's gonna go viral because he's gonna say some of the realest [ __ ] we've heard uh in in 10 years honestly I'm I'm losing I'm losing faith I feel like that like I'm not sure I know it's only been it only just happened but it's just not given me he about to come out here and really like chop it up I'm not sure what the play is that's why I'm trying to figure out for all black people and I'm gonna say something y'all ain't gonna like it y'all ain't gonna like me but I'm gonna say this Cornell West is not is not going to be in in his most fervorous moment is not going to be out here representing black queer people black women he is not gonna be it is gonna be a very CIS hetero patriarchal we all black it's very elite it's gonna be very cool very black excellent food straps Sun type of [ __ ] that is what it's gonna be and yeah it's gonna go viral and it's gonna hit real hard once he gets on that church circuit and he go starts going to the churches and talking to them that's when it's gonna hit but we know who's gonna be left out in the cold with this and his always was left out in the cold We're Not Gonna See Cornell West linking up with Stacy Abrams in Georgia and whatnot and all this all right we're not gonna see any of that we're not gonna see any of that he is a lone wolf in this regard as he deserves to be because he is not running to be everybody's president he's already talked about it this is I'm sorry I now got to go he's already announcing he's heading to Rural America to talk to people with people he has not said [ __ ] about going to the hood you see what I'm saying yeah everything I needed to know I really didn't hear much I just heard the main talking points about um about like you know the main things right oh black health and this and that but it was just giving me more so like a movie that was coming out because he knows he really knows what he is to black people and he's going off of that celebrity beyond the celebrity I need to know what you can represent because like you said it's not giving me that you're actually here to represent you said Gabrielle it's a cash grab I'm not mad I'm not exactly mad um not upset but I'll say like you know I don't want to give him till Friday I'm actually upset that he didn't come out of the gate that's what I'm saying it should just be a black ass campaign if you're doing your own thing I've had that conversation with Rebecca um like a bunch of times right I'm like you know when you see other people's shows you go on the media space and all these different things and you think like it can only be like this is just generally I would always because I everybody's thing is but you see clearly and you can really experience like what people are like and what they stand for when they have their own thing you know what I mean what they create on their own and that's why I'm like if you watch my show versus any of my media appearances very different place it's a very different place okay it's a very black landscape because that's what I'm into here's what I'm saying like when I can choose to guess when I choose to this so I'm like if you're just doing something if you were just doing something not to win your motivation should be primarily your focus should be black people the black community Black Liberation black voice that should be what it is about that if you want me to get on board with some artificial [ __ ] that's just for you know symbolic movement rhetoric blah blah blah then it should be black it should be black centered it should be black focus it should be black so watch your brand on you have a 50-year brand behind black [ __ ] black people black Elite black positive black education your brand the reason people know who you are is because of black people we are the people who build you up we pay your bills we got you to where you are you are the ethos of Black Codes people want to speak about Black Culture they call Cornell West so to come out the gate for a presidential campaign and immediately say [ __ ] Y'all exactly because essentially potentially how I heard exactly and I said so this is just even in today when you said Russell Brandon I had to really it didn't sit but I said that doesn't sound political too much it really's given me entertainment and if we're talking about entertainment this becomes performative that whole campaign video was very like like it was just like let's look at him for the black the black being from back in the day because that's what it was giving him and I didn't like it and I said man I wanted something stronger I don't care if he was standing outside with a whole bunch of poor people or sitting down with some black folks who are working class or whatever having conversations I would have rabbit something real real and authentic because a lot of how we move is off of what he's been teaching for like literally over a few decades this is where we're going off of and you come out the gate on some new [ __ ] it doesn't wrong with me it hey and just like that and it came down to it and only black women were left listen thank you my wonderful thank you I told you this is gonna be great thank you all so much Cornell West I had decided this is my first collaboration on my show because I decided I wasn't wow of course Uber calls me right now it's really the disrespect is crazy we've been sitting there this whole time wow hold on I can't I'm trying to have a show hi the door exactly yeah
