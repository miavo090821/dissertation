        "text": "@sashaellis5053 So you can find this information on just a basic google search, but just off the top of my head, we know that hormone production and puberty does not restart naturally upon cessation of blockers, it just doesnt. It also works that way when men and male teens take steroids, your hormone production is completely and significantly shut down to take high levels of hormones, because you're adding exogenous hormones. Secondly, there is a marked decrease in bone development that DOES NOT resume to get back to normal levels and that leads to several lifetime issues, such as osteoporosis and fractures, as well as stunted height and limb growth. Lastly, we know there has been no statistically significant improvement of symptoms, well being, or suicide rates for those who were put on blockers and/or went through surgeries. You are insane and terribly misinformed, if you truly believe there are no long term consequences for STOPPING A CHILDS DEVELOPMENT IN THEIR MAJOR DEVELOPMENTAL YEARS.",

        "text": "@My_Crazy_Neighbor There's a simple reason why you would do that. Adam's 'evidence' is backed by survivor's bias i.e. of course if you ask people who fully transitioned to justify to you why they did it they will claim they always wanted to from a young age and never doubted or changed their mind, whether that is true or not. But that is not all children that express gender confusion, that's working backwards from the people you need to actually ask. 95%+ of children who experience gender confusion grow out of it, it really is simply a phase or they needed to sort something out. But now what if you force them into that decision under the guise of being tolerant? They pick up something pink once and you whisk them off to the doctor to immediately pump them full of chemicals to confirm your own ideology? This is already happening in sweden where therapists are pressuring girls with autism to transition and claim they're boys as the only explanation for their condition, and many of them are very dissatisfied and feel railroaded, because they were. You could say the reverse could happen, a parent stopping a child from being who they are, and hollywood makes a lot of hullabaloo about this scenario, but in real life, on the broad scale this is the less likely outcome and you are more likely to force a \"normal\" child to be strange to satisfy your own ego and they will grow up damaged or resentful.",

First, I'm grateful to know you have absolutely nothing to do with the OP's kid's life, since you don't seem to know a single thing about being a good parent. I find it hilarious to see that you're still defending your moronic smearing and judging of someone from more than a month ago! 😂 If anyone is a SJW here it's you for trying to attack a parent that had to deal with raising their kid in confusing ass times! If anyone is a Libtard Karen here it's you for trying to parent someone else's grown ass kid through YouTube comments! If anyone is a snowflake here it's you for being too fragile to understand that there are different cultures and morals around the world besides your own, and not everyone grew up, lived there lives, and died believing the same things you believed! What you view as a sin might be another culture's way of life. What's your way of life is almost guaranteed to be a sin to other cultures! You might as well be hating on Jews, Muslims, and some Christians for not eating pork. You might as well be burning books on Hinduism for accepting sexuality as a part of natural human experience. You might as well be forcing other people's kids to commit suicide, because heaven forbid they can't explore and learn to understand their own emotions and confusions. Get a grip man, you're a sinner just like the rest of us, so stop throwing stones from your glass house!",

When I was under the age of ten I was surrounded by nothing but women and it showed in my personality I was very timid soft spoken and with drawn, Did not like conflict or physical contact but when I was ten moved in with my dad started playing football with the kids in the neighborhood did not like it at first because I taught the sport was too rough, But now I like heavy weight lifting and boxing . I can totally see had I continue being raised around women how different I would have turned out",

Kids say lots of things with conviction, and no principle has been identified as to the mechanism that helps one identify a child's legitimate conviction regarding their genitalia.",

Trans children, are treated with hormone blockers, which simply delay puberty, until they're an adult, when they can begin hormone replacement therapy. If at any point they realize they're not trans, they can stop taking the puberty blockers, and their body will develop as it would otherwise. They do not, as the creator of this video repeatedly states, cause sterilization or  infertility. The treatment is shown to be greatly beneficial to mental health, as going through the puberty not associated with your gender identity is often a very traumatic experience, and makes transitioning later in life a far more arduous process",

        "text": "@sashaellis5053 I suppose opinions vary:\n\nhttps://www.thenewatlantis.com/publications/growing-pains\n\n\"For patients and doctors who are committed to the view that the young person’s gender dysphoria represents a persistent and real problem that can best be solved by transitioning the patient to living as the opposite sex, puberty suppression can seem like a desirable approach. But most children who identify as the opposite sex will not persist in these feelings and will eventually come to identify as their biological sex: According to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, “In natal [biological] males, persistence [of gender dysphoria] has ranged from 2.2% to 30%. In natal females, persistence has ranged from 12% to 50%.”[97] (As noted earlier, there is some evidence that cross-gender identification becomes more persistent if it lasts into adolescence.[98]) The relatively low levels of persistence pose a challenge for those who would use puberty-suppressing treatments for young children — and for those who recommend encouraging and affirming children in their cross-gender identification. The epidemiologically low persistence rates suggest that puberty suppression would not be wise for all children who experience gender dysphoria, since it would be an unnecessary treatment for those children whose gender dysphoria would not persist if they received no intervention, and it is generally considered best, in clinical practice, to avoid unnecessary medical interventions. And beyond unnecessary, the interventions could, in some cases, be harmful, if they lead children whose gender dysphoria may have resolved in adolescence to instead persist in a dysphoric condition.\"",

Women can compete in any open and can qualify for invitational but can also compete in separate women's only events.  The titles like Master, National Master, International Master, and Grand Master are available to any who complete the specified requirements but can also attain women's only titles like Women's Master, Women's International Master, Women's Grand Master, that have lower requirements.  Anyone who plays well enough can qualify for the Candidates cycle and challenge for the World Championship while there is also a separate Women's World Championship just for the ladies.\n\nHowever, no woman has ever qualified for the World Championship (though Judit Polgar did qualify for the Candidates cycle once) nor to my knowledge has one ever defeated a reigning World Champion (though Judit had a controversial touch move game against Garry Kasparov once) .  Only one woman, Judit Polgar, has ever broken into the world's top ten players.  Currently, there is only one woman in the world's top 100 players.  Due to these facts they still say Chess is sexist.  Trans people could play in the men's events like anyone but idk about women's events.",

People often say, \"I wish I had a bigger D\", \"I wish I had bigger boobs\", smaller nose etc. These are all common thoughts that everybody has, but the fact is, we can't change that stuff genetically. Some might surgically alter themselves later on in life and wish they could have experienced our teen years with what they view as a more picturesque body. Rather than alter these things in the first place, or spend our time wishing things were different, we should learn to accept our perceived faults . These faults are only viewed from our own perception and these perceived deficiencies are overblown and often false. In most cases if you could relive your life over again with \"better\" genes, parts or hormonal balance, you would find that you'd still be the awkward, confused and ridiculous person you are now, but with  different things you dislike about yourself. The point is, you can't escape yourself. Wherever you go, there you are.",
