He took the barber's shotgun, and entered the classroom SOLO.\nAccording to that same source, there were dozens of rounds fired while the police stood around outside the school and classroom!  I'll admit, I'm getting that info second and third hand, but it needs to be addressed!  If this is true, it makes the police look so bad.\nI'm pro 2A.  Several of my friends and relatives are cops.  This has nothing to do with me wanting to defund the police or any such bullshite.  I come to watch AJW because I respect his research - but he didn't even address a bit of this!\nIf they're lies, they should be called out.  If its truth, it needs to be shouted even louder!",

In this instance, the authorities may have prevented people from ending the events much sooner.  The counter being that authorities want to limit extraneous casualties and confusion from untrained people entering the insanity of the situation, which makes their jobs easier. While it is true that those parents being prevented from going in might have ended the situation, it is also possible that those same parents would end up as victims and tie up even more resources, or lead to police taking even longer to piece through the situation.\n\nThe problem, ultimately, is that we are examining the whole incident in hindsight. Are we sure that we would have done something different given the information they had at the time?",

Or with the school I am currently associated with, one of the officers is easily three billsnand not even 6ft, I'll let you check the bmi charts. Resource officers are general not able to be regular cops, so they get a cushy job. It's definitely a #notall situation. But I just gave you two (anecdotal) examples. The small school she was shared among the three campuses primary, intermediate, and high. And the current school, that's one officer among the four campuses I visit and there isn't an officer on elementary campuses. \nGet offending if you like but there's a reason they are [adj] cop...

Plenty of times cops have been ordered to stand down and do nothing in extreme cases, though that's often for riots and the like. Chances are someone wanted to either worsen the situation at the school or make the cops look bad, or was too afraid to send cops after a minority criminal as we've seen happen often enough as well.\n\nFunny thing is, it's being used to fuel anti-gun agenda when in reality it helps show us that cops, especially when strong-armed by politics these days, are less useful than arming yourself. Then again, I'm sure an onsite psychologist could've easily skipped his way to the gunman and hashed things out civilly like good comrades of the state, that's sure to of happened in the cop-less utopia they want.",

If this happen at my son's school and I seen cops doing nothing I honestly would probably make entry myself but it's definitely a last resort and only if I see no other options to possibly save my son's life and others, however you should never roll up on an active shooter scene when cops are already posted because more then likely they will think u are the shooter. Especially if your wearing armor or a eig of some sort with a long rifle, more then likely it would be an everyday conceal carry that u have on u. It's not a perfect world like Hollywood wants u to believe, all that being said, if they were to offer a position as an armed security guard for the school for these type of situations I would do it without hesitation. And I'm not saying Im Superman but I bet I have way more experience with shooting back while being shot at then most of the cops do. And spent many years of my life training for similar scenarios. I'm sure there are 1000s of vets just like me that would have no problem making school security thier career and loving it.",

    "text": "I am a police  officer in Canada, it is common practice, since Columbine that 'immediate rapid deployment' (IRD) in active killing situations means responding officers (non-tactical officers just Sworn Constables) make teams of 3 to 4 armed with Carbines and with ballistic vest respond by ignoring literally everything, including injured children, teachers and colleagues to eliminate the threat. In a barricaded hostage scenario without active killing, this changes drastically (usage of tactical teams). I just question, how does a person who's killed so many already, qualify as a barricaded hostage scenario? A lot of IRD training revolves around the idea that if someone is in a room  barricaded police entering  the 'funnel' (the door) will be shot, but a group with ballistic plates as a wall, should be able to overcome a shooter, even if multiple Officers are shot (the idea). \n\nI also don't understand how a State (Texas) with so many guns can make a 'school' a gun free zone, isn't this a straight up oxy moron? Canadian schools in the Toronto area, Surrey / BC lower mainland with gang gun problems have metal detectors and multiple police. Just seems a little bit well, stupid.",

Why expend our resources to people who won't take their job seriously? There is no reason that many police officers couldn't have taken out ONE person. The person didn't even have an uncommon weapon. If the training they receive is inadequate for taking out ONE person then that's still on the police department. Everything is pointing to them being the main problem.",

No this needs to be looked into why the chief gave such orders that go directly against the policy of the department when dealing with active (or potentially active) shooters, as these unorthodox orders are what got people killed.",

    "text": "As school shootings appear to be on the increase since I graduated High School 30 years ago, and as the school held an \"active shooter training drill\"  just before this shooting happened, I would be interested to know if the school classrooms are equipped with the  bulletproof glass and heavy-duty security doors that are resistant to forced entry that so many people have been calling for over the years BEFORE questioning why the Boarder Patrol Agents needed a custodian to unlock the classroom door to gain entry. If those doors are designed to resist forced entry for the protection of the students and staff barricaded in a classroom during an active shooter incident, then it makes perfect sense as to why a key is needed rather than trying to break the door down with a battering ram. I remember many years ago hearing about some public schools installing bulletproof windows and heavy duty security doors in their classrooms. Was the door to the classroom the shooter was barricaded in a door that could've even been knocked down with a battering ram? Or was it's a heavy duty, steel reinforced security door designed to prevent a shooter from entering easily?",

This was a horrible call as they decided to wait until a tactical team arrived on scene to go in. This means that there was a barrier to gaining access to getting treatment for the wounded. \n\nThe police were inside the building, and the shooter began engaging them… so perhaps that’s why he made the call to say he was barricaded. Again, it’s not a call I agree with. I carry breaching tools in my unit, as do many of the other officers that I work with. The supervisors have bunkers to aid the breaching team. I don’t think a ram would have been as helpful as a sledge and a halligan. You asked some very good questions about what those officers had on hand. I purchased my own after getting the A.L.E.R.T training. But it is likely there were firefighters around the scene somewhere that they could have given access to some of those tools. I’m hoping more info comes out because there are way more questions than answers.",

    "text": "*First off, Matt Christiensen had an interesting point about the convenient timing of everything as well. The shooter shot his grandmother, then started sending messages and even started his live stream before he drove over. The teacher that propped the door open (that he used to enter) did so about 20 mins before his arrival at the school. On top of that, he was shooting at people before he even got near the school, and the school was on lockdown I believe because police had already been called. Yet, the teacher who knowingly left a door open made no effort to get it closed, even when there was an obvious threat. Maybe it's a foil hat thing, but he explains the timeline much better and I'm as suspicious as him, which is mild to critical depending on how much you trust what we've been told.\n\nAlso, HOLY SHIT DUDE, I didn't know you had an incident with cops as a kid, I did too but I was even younger, maybe 8-10 at most. \nMe and a friend were playing in the park at our school, and we saw the police investigating the catholic school right next door. Naturally, we went over to see what was happening, and a cop came up and started asking us if we knew anything, and somehow I said something that made them actually cuff me and take me to the station, without my parents around or anything. I was fully interrogated and gave false testimony because I was scared as fuck, and I happened to guess which bathrooms were vandalized in the school (2 main level, one upstairs, just made sense to me). When my mom finally got there, I could hear her screaming at them the moment she was in the building, and she whisked me out of there while cussing the fuck out of those piece of shit cops.\nShe should've sued, but it's not as simple in Canada, unfortunately.",

That would not be the head of the local PD.  \nit also has been reported that the belief was the shooter was barricaded and not with students, which would make it a bit more reasonable to not enter. \nAs for weapons and equipment, it appears all or many of the officers shown had long guns and vests, which is all that you need to do a reasonable immediate response.  \nActive shooter threat response has been taught and practiced for years; in response to Columbine, where SOP of establishing a perimeter and wait for the tactical team was shown to be the wrong way to handle school shootings.  \nThe only reasonable thing that makes sense was the police believed the story of the barricaded shooter, otherwise simple CYA would have required immediate response.  This does conflict with the recurrent 911 calls coming from the school, so something is screwy there.  \nThe only thing the BORTAC unit appeared to have was a ballistic shield, and maybe threat level III vests (for rifle protection) as such vests generally are not suitable for daily wear (although they exist).   \nOne of the BORTAC guys wasn’t wearing a helmet as he was wounded in the head, so that wasn’t a deterrent from deploying.  \nI can only say by the what looks like a horrible performance by the officers on scene was they believed the barricade shooter story.   \nAlso, the “Scene commander” could have been just the highest ranking officer there.  Not necessarily anyone with command or tactical expertise.   \nJust a horrible f*d up situation all around.",

By the time they arrive, the damage will have already been done, and the attackers will escape leaving no leads, case closed.\n\nNow compound that fact with the fact that the police may be on standby at the site of the emergency, yet simply lack the ability or even merely the will to intervene. Even on a good day, you *cannot* simply rely on them. Other systems and protocols need to be in place, and despite never even wanting to be in the presence of a firearm if I don't have to, I've yet to be convinced that prohibiting them will stop the killings. Especially not if the police will just stand around doing nothing but restraining people who would actually put themselves in harm's way to assist.",

The police only have the right to abandon the measure if its completion could lead to an unreasonable outcome in relation to the objective pursued which clearly could not be reasoned with in this instance.\n\nIf there will be no criminal charges (provided no new evidence comes forward to somehow make their actions reasonable), then there need to be changes in your laws as this is not a reasonable way to run a society.",
