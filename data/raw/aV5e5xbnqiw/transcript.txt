hello and welcome to the weekend podcast of low to see this i'm here with josh and hello we're going to be picking up where we left off yesterday uh talking about marks and debunking marx's view on the individual and human motivation and selfishness things like that exactly so i want to kick us off with a quote from marx talking about human motivation so this is this is a he's got a bit of a weird choice of words here so i will explain it once i've gone for it but man is dire is directly a natural being as a natural being and as a living natural being he is one on the one hand endowed with natural powers vital powers he is an active natural being these forces exist in him as tendencies and abilities as instincts on the other hand as a natural corporeal sensuous object objective being even he is suffering conditioned and a limited creature like animals and plants that is to say the objects of his instincts exist outside of him as objects independent of him yet these objects are objects that he needs essential objects indispensable to the manifestation and the confirmation of his essential powers okay so essentially he's saying that human instincts provide us with needs and those needs are outside of ourselves and therefore we have to do things to fulfill those needs which is really not very controversial to pretty much anyone i should imagine it's a very drawn out way of saying that yeah i mean he he could have framed it a little bit more concisely but this isn't like a review of marx's writing style unfortunately which is very dense and pretty annoying actually but um he also says in simpler terms it is true that eating drinking and procreating etc are genuine human functions however when abstracted from the aspects of human activity and turned into final and exclusive ends they are animal okay so this ties into his view that capitalism is the product of perhaps selfish desires as well because he's essentially saying human beings obviously have these needs or they have a an instinct to fulfill needs of eating drinking and procreating but anything um that is kind of outside of this realm is what we would perhaps consider being a human being just simply fulfilling needs is what animals do and that's what he's arguing he's arguing for something above this essentially base okay so does he say that these base things are what makes us human and what we have in common with animals or is it that there's something else that makes sense he's saying it's something else so he's saying these needs are kind of animalistic they they they define us in what we have to do but they do not define what being a human being is unnecessarily yeah and i don't necessarily disagree with that actually i think that's perfectly reasonable position um however it seems to tie into his view that capitalism somehow perverts human nature essentially that it it makes people um see these ends as or these desires as ends in themselves sorry right so that so he he's saying that human human nature is is something beyond these base needs yeah but but because that's capitalism you um these these things that go beyond are not actualized because because capitalism forces everyone to act on these base needs instead of being properly human actualizing yourself yeah so the actual language he uses is that capitalism fetishizes these needs essentially like they they make them seem like they're an end in themselves rather than fulfilling some kind of higher purpose so the point then is that capitalism makes you less human and makes you more like an animal because you follow these animal instincts you prevent it basically by society by the economic system from developing your true nature yeah right so that's what he believes however i would say that capitalism's focus on these needs at the time that marx was writing was not unfounded like it wasn't they weren't at a point where food and clean water were kind of abundant right at the time of mark's writing and in fact many of his marks his own children were malnourished so he should have been well aware of this one of his children died due to faults of his own he was not short of money he just spent it on himself which uh is a whole other can of worms but he's uh not exactly the most moral person as you can probably imagine by the manifestation of his ideas but anyway uh i'd like to move on to why i i don't think this idea is correct with a bit of science so i'd like to kind of look at maslow's hierarchy of needs which i don't necessarily agree with this model per se and i'll get on to that in a second but it's it's good for kind of making the point that you have these base needs and you have the need for food water warmth rest and then you have higher needs like security safety all the way up to things like self-actualization which is like pursuing your your goals and having psychological fulfillment although this self-actualization is what is perhaps disputed oh sorry i'm getting past um so there's certainly a cultural component to this which i'll get onto because a lot of criticism of maslow's hierarchy of needs is that um it's very culturally specific to the west right and so just just to make clear the idea is that you have you have some needs that are more basic and yeah are kind of more base and that you have to satisfy in order to be able to essentially care about about the others and so the more needs you satisfy them the further and further you get the pyramid exactly and so so that you you don't you don't like get to think about all kind of consider the higher needs when you haven't satisfied your ones so that's the basic idea if understanding correctly yeah and um there have been plenty of criticisms to suggest that it's not actually a pyramid and there's lots of exchange between certain layers and essentially the theory is discredited but it's something that everyone is familiar with and it kind of gets the the gist of the the point across so we can kind of see and so is it discredited as a whole or is it just discredited as this kind of this specific thing specifically with with those things that are mentioned in the original pyramid yeah something like that note that the idea that that some needs are less important or kind of less basic and some more basically the underlying philosophy behind it hasn't been discredited okay but the the actual objective structuring of the the pyramid so the specific content of the team yes right yeah so it's just more of a theoretical point though okay a philosophical one it makes sense so i want to quickly go into a study of cultural influence on motivation to kind of prove the point that motivation is something that is perhaps more in the head than in your biology almost as marx says so i'm kind of making his his point for him here but essentially it's a study that is called rethinking the value of choice a cultural perspective on intrinsic motivation and the study says that anglo-american children showed less intrinsic motivation when choices were made for them by others than when they made their own choices whether the others were authority figures or peers in contrast asian-american children proved most intrinsically motivated when the choices were made for them by trusted authority figures or peers so it's kind of showing some degree of cultural influence on how people are motivated which seems to suggest that it's not innate to your biological nature so um although marx's characterization of human beings being motivated by something else in their nature might not necessarily be correct there's certainly a need for motivation so he's he's close to being correct if you get what i mean yeah yeah i do yeah so there's um a theory of people's needs and motivation known as the free needs theory by mcclelland um which generally speaking research shows that 86 of the population is at least dominant in one or two or all three of these types of motivation and they are need for achievement need for affiliation and need for power which sounds very sinister but it's not actually as bad as it sounds um so need for achievement is where people who have a need for achievement prefer to work on tasks of moderate difficulty in which results are based on their efforts rather than on anything else to receive feedback on their work achievement-based individuals tend to avoid both high-risk and low-risk situations low-risk situations are seen as too easy to be valid and high-risk situations are seen as two they um seen as based more on luck of the situation rather than the achievements that the individual actually made so this personality type is motivated by accomplishment in places like the workplace and they excel in employment where there is a hierarchy with kind of opportunity for promotion okay and just to uh kind of backtrack a little bit this this theory kind of acknowledges the the culturally different needs so it can explain the the differences in the previous study so the need for achievement is perhaps more of a western um notion whereas this next one the need for affiliation might explain why the asian american children were more keen to have their motivation set for them by someone else and essentially and so it's worth pointing out probably that that we're not attributing anything to any individual we're saying that on this this is what was shown in the studies it's it's like statistical trends and generalizations obviously there are exceptions to every rule and i'm not trying to make any generalizations about people i'm just trying to kind of recite what the research says [Music] it's obligatory kept yet of course the need for affiliation then okay so people who have a need for affiliation prefer to spend time creating maintaining social relationships and enjoy being part of groups and have a desire to feel loved and accepted people in this group tend to adhere to the norms of the culture in the workplace and typically do not change the challenge the norms sorry of the workplace for fear of rejection this person favors collaboration over competition and does not like situations with high risk or high uncertainty people who have the need for affiliation work well in areas based on social interaction like customer service or client interaction positions so obviously you can see this is a little bit workplace focused but i mean it it's good to kind of give you real world examples that you might have experience with because otherwise it's too much in abstraction yep sometimes so the need for power um people who have a need for power prefer to work and place a high value on discipline the downside to this motivational type is that group goals can become a zero sum becomes zero sum in nature sorry that is for one person to win another must lose however this can be positively applied to help accomplish group goals and to help others the group feel competent about their work a person motivated by this need enjoys status recognition winning arguments competition and influencing others so it's basically youtube comment sections so you can see that there's a very different characterization here from kind of modern psychology than how marx characterizes human motivation he's very focused on very base needs whereas this is all directed at kind of psychological needs right yeah and i think that's just a product of the different times in which these theories have come from obviously this is a very modern theory and it caters to modern motivations to act which are mainly psychological whereas in marx's time there's a lot of focus on just satisfying your desire for food and on with motivations yeah exactly so it seems to suggest that although perhaps marx was right for his time it is not as applicable in the modern day so so if someone in in modern day had a desire for for money or to to have that economic motivation that could be kind of filed under one of one of these one of these uh boxes as well um just just not necessarily but in a way where money represents something else money represents uh satisfaction of a psychological or another psychological need rather than an and an end in itself yeah i mean i i certainly wouldn't discredit the the notion that certain people might see money as an end in in and of itself i've i feel like i've come across a certain few people that feel that way and certainly money is a sign of status where perhaps it shouldn't be but um i'm going into a tangent again so you can essentially see that the marxist theory of motivation has kind of gone out of date and although it doesn't necessarily describe um human beings today it's not necessarily something that he was wrong about in his day so could we say that that it it describes something fairly accurately but it's only a narrow part of of people's motivation that they do have this economic motivation and that is a driving factor with people but it's not the only driving factor and in other situations such as when people are get wealthier and get and get other kind of interests then they they also have other motivations which might completely overshadow the economic motivation that they had that they started with yeah that seems perfectly reasonable and i think we should move on to individuals in history this is uh quite a brief section but i thought it was important because it it's perhaps one of marx's more bizarre kind of tirades where he believes that history goes its own way and according to the laws of nature so he believes there's some kind of natural order to history which seems very bizarre to anyone who's probably studied history because one thing from at least my reading of history is that there seems to be very little in the way of predictability of what happens just as a as a general rule yeah i mean i i think he was specifically talking about uh economic systems and he had he had his economic theory which uh which was uh his historical explanation of kind of economic political political history which was that you had in kind of a primitive proto-communist society then then you had a move to feudalism and then from feudalism you had moved to capitalism and then then that that was what was in place at his time according to him and then that there was a need to move to another stage with which of socialism and then the last stage would be communism and so so so that kind of historical progression was according to him inevitable right yeah that's essentially his interpretation of how history would progress and he really hated the kind of typical western tradition of interpreting history of great individuals and he really disliked this and essentially um he would say well had caesar never crossed the rubicon bringing the end to the roman republic someone else would have filled that same role and although i'm putting words in marx's mouth i'm sure he would have probably agreed with that like he he didn't want to emphasize that any one individual could have a significant influence on history he believed that the factors were set in motion and there was nothing any one individual could do so the roles would have already been set and the individual just fulfilled the roles and assumed those positions other positions would have already been there yeah but i don't necessarily agree with that at all i think that's a terrible interpretation of history like there are so many individuals in history where they had these weird individual quirks that made them the way they are and made things play out the way they did which wouldn't have otherwise even played out in the next most similar person if you know what i mean yeah i think i get what you mean by is isn't that i i would i would say i agree that you have people with so with such an individual kind of quirky nature or something like that that it makes them different in a scenario where someone else would have acted differently and that's what produce like snowball effects in in the future but isn't when something is just someone is just acting generically and some something is just like moving by itself and there's no one really not no purposeful action behind it and it's just something that someone does sure it's a the npc position i can kind of use the example of someone like stalin where had he uh kind of in the latter years of his dictatorship of the ussr had he not been so incredibly paranoid perhaps far fewer number of people would have died like had another communist assumed the same position in that dictatorship they they may have been secure enough in their own position that they wouldn't feel the need to kill numbers of people and of course you've got the the case of the doctor's plot where he killed so many doctors that none of them wanted to help him so they left him dying on the floor yeah so yeah had it been someone else perhaps it would have been different yeah i i think you're right in that i i actually think if if we were talking about the soviet union the a good example of this is gorbachev because he had he had what he did was he inherited you know became the leader of the soviet union and he he allowed for the de facto secession of of the the ussr's satellite states and and therefore for the whole ussr empire to to fall just because because he didn't he didn't think he should repeat what he had done in in hungary in in 1956 or in czechoslovakia in 1968 and so so he could have done that that was president for that when when countries try to separate themselves from this from the sphere of influence of the soviet union and they're going to get the tanks and tanks in the street so he could have done that and that would have been predictable but instead he chose not to do it and chose to kind of sit back and let it play out and that's that's what caused the ussr to ultimately collapse in the way that it did okay i i i'm not very good with my uh post style in russian history like anything anything from the tsars to to stalin i'm good with but beyond that i'm completely ignorant yes that's that's kind of like a remarkable story that that is well known but no one badly like people by talking no i'm not familiar is that like the collapse of the soviet union um happened quite in a quite clean way nothing nothing there there was no there was no widespread bloodshed that the rulers were overthrown kind of peacefully not everywhere of course like in romania the the family of churches was was all killed um but overall um in comparison with other revolutions in in the past this was a very clean collapse of an empire like that and so so that's the story that is that is rarely talked about and it's a weird yeah that's a really good case of what i was looking for actually yeah yeah probably better than online that that's that's a good case for what are you talking about because you wouldn't expect it to happen like that exactly but it did because of that one person because he uh didn't decide to do the usual thing he decided to do something that he wasn't expected by anyone to do yeah that's exactly what i'm looking for so i want to move on to the final section now which is marks on the limitations to the individual so marx didn't necessarily deny the importance of the individual but he saw them part of a collective which formed their worldview essentially just to reiterate the part from the first part so he says men inevitably enter into definite relations which independent of their will namely relations of production so essentially what he's saying here is people are limited by the fact that they have to work to put food on the table right that's that's the gist of what he's saying which you know no one's going to dispute that that's obvious yeah fair enough um but he has a very interesting take on slavery and serfdom so he recognized that the oppressor still had some obligations to the oppressed in that they still had to ensure they were fed and cared for when they are not working to ensure their so-called service in the future continued um so in this context marks viewed liberal reforms that sought to bring equality before the law as freeing the exploiter from the responsibility from their lot like of these people's lives okay great which is a very unusual take perhaps because particularly to free western societies this the notion of people being free is a very inherent thing but in marx's time i think it's a product of the scarcity of his time that he believed that perhaps some people were better off so he would make the analogy that kind of persists among marxists through this day that employment and kind of economic relations between an employer and an employee are similar to a relation between a slave and a slave master yeah and and that that it's it's much more visible much more transparent if if it's a slave and a slave master and then if and therefore uh you you can you can see that someone is the oppressor someone is depressed and then and you can say this this life master you have you have these like obligations that you have to fulfill it's not just that you you can you can do whatever you want with them but if it's if it's the economic relations that the liberals supposedly had been had been advocating for then it the same thing is kind of relinquished in the economic relations between the employee and the employer essentially the employer is absolved of their sins if they're in a liberal society whereas right in a society that marx envisioned they should be kind of held accountable yeah and so so that in in marx's view right so there's the employer employee relationship isn't it is analogous to that of the slave and the slave master and so if you if you're trying to remove the responsibility of the employer it's the same thing as you as if you were saying to the slave master that he is fined if he kind of beats his life to death something like that right is am i am i understanding that correctly uh i'm not entirely sure like because he was trying to point out that the the relation between the employer yeah the dynamic it's not it's not it's not free because there are economic constraints that put the employee in a much worse position to negotiate and things like that so he would say that because of these outer constraints outside constraints the situation that you end up with is is essentially similar to that of a slave and a slave master i mean i i don't agree i don't agree in in his context and i especially don't agree in like today's society because it's much less relevant that kind of a critique but but that's i think how how he would see the situation in those kind of societal relations yeah in in the modern day like at least in a western society we only need to work for essentially what is half of our life because we have perhaps 40 years at the lowest maybe 40 to 50 it is kind of the average where we have to work to provide for ourselves but in our childhood and in our old age we our labor is able to provide for ourselves and so in in those cases we are even in marx's view free so if we have no obligations to an employer we are essentially disproving marx's idea that you know if you are bound by either employment contract or serfdom you are somehow forever going to be burdened if you get what i'm trying to say probably anyway i think it's best to end it there and thank you very much for watching and enjoy the rest of your weekend [Music] you
