This is regardless of Israel's origin as a colonizing apartheid power, because most nations have brutal and bloody origins, Israel being no exception. A new ideology based on a foundation of respect for human rights and for the sovereignty of others (Palestine, Yemen, Iran, list goes on) must take root in Israel.

Of course you have exceptions where someone are patriotic towards a country they weren't born in because of ancestry or even a deep fascination and identification of a foreign culture. But, these are exceptions to the rule. Especially the latter example is more about identity confusion than actual patriotism. Yes, patriots often refer to personal heritage as their motivation. But, it's nonetheless about the individual and them being born in that country. Also, far from all patriots have a deep heritage. Especially in USA, most patriots are actually ancestors of immigrants not that many generations ago. Even second-generation immigrants are often patriots. They adopt the heritage of their nation as their own. Whether there is an actual bloodline is not the most important thing for most patriots. It's a sense of a shared common national heritage. Very few Americans are related to the founding fathers, but still patriots regard them as their national fathers. The very fact that the term 'father' is used to describe these people goes to show how national heritage is not the same as personal heritage through bloodlines.",

You're very vague with this term, and unfortunately it leads me to the opinion that this is simply a misunderstanding (at the very least) or a deliberate provocation/misrepresentation of the political position.

These followers of the alt left formerly known as Democrats are being taught so much hate and hypocrisy through propaganda most are totally indoctrinated to the point that logic is a foreign concept. Just a few examples 1:They claim the election was rigged with foreign interference but requiring voter ID is racist because blacks and minorities don't have access to the DMV and can't afford computers and internet somehow believing that is not racist. 2: incredible amount of hate towards Christians because they don't approve of homosexuality and they killed a bunch of people hundreds of years ago during the Crusades, Muslims however treated like royalty they are loved and cheered for by liberals and third-wave feminist very odd considering Muslims having a much harsher stance on homosexuality and believe women are second-class citizens they are less than man the NPCs don't know how to logically explain this but the Puppet Masters know the \"enemy of my enemy\"...... 3: this was a recent one I caught on The View but it sums up a broader point naturally they were convincing in reaffirming their followers that Trump and his supporters are less than human they are deplorable they don't deserve Humane treatment and all that bullshit. Topic was  the tear gas used at the border recently listening to The View you would swear it was Trump out there double fisting bean bag shotgun aiming for children and their guests pointed out that the man Obama personally appointed to Homeland Security was caught handing over thousands of children to \"work camps\" smh did the audience care? nope.  she was quickly cut off by one of the bitches who loudly and angrily States we are not talking about Obama we are talking about Trump and the audience cheered. Obama has done so many vile and corrupt things in 8 years and most people never heard about it thanks to the media watching his back or they give him a pass because he's black so  automatically he's a perfect man the best president anybody who says otherwise is racist",

This aspect was never really convered in school.\nThey told us how everyone just stumbled into this conflict no one wanted and then kept throwing men and ressources at it untill someone ran out of them, but they never illustrated why no one thought to stop the madness apart from \"Well, people were stiill stuck with the medieval perception of war as being glorious\" before everything collapsed into rubble. Now it's pretty clear what kept the madness going. \nI mean you would think the Revolutionaries would have received fair treatment after chasing out the nobles and the generals, after all they'd done that to end the fighting and it wasn't even the same government anymore, but in this context it would've been hard to sell anything like that, because who cares about productive solutions when you can just stick it to your opponents. Of course the surviving generals opperated on much the same logic. \nIt was all such a bitter waste.",

Keep in mind, that from the perspective of the French, the Napoleonic War was an extension of the Revolutionary Wars, it was about spreading the new rational rule across the world, and enlightenment values against the broken aristocratism of Germany, Russia and Britain. Those parts in turn saw France as a horrendous threat to their traditions, values, and way of life, much like the Western powers viewed the Soviet Union in the Cold War.",

This inspite of nearly three years of the first world war and as others have said Americas experiences in the Civil War. Due to the Zimmerman Telegram, Germanys resumption of unrestricted U-Boat warfare, German actions (both real and exagerated) in Belgium and German sponsored Sabotage on US soil made it politically impossible, with the likes of Theodore Roosevelt whipping up jingoistic sentiment, for Woodrow Wilson to keep the US out of the war. It was a turning point for the US and gave rise to the military industrial complex that is so central to US foreign power today. The very Idea of US taxpayers paying for the maintenance of large armed forces would have been unthinkable to the founding fathers. Prior to American entry into the war the US army was at most 200000 strong. Just two years later over 4 million Americans had served at one point or other in the armed forces.

    "text": "My great grandfather was a welshman that was targeted by the order of the white feather during the early years of the war. According to the story told to me by my grandfather before he passed on was that my great grandfather, Frederick, hadn't enlisted at least in part due to his ardent Welsh nationalist sympathies and didn't think it was just for the victims of English colonialism to enlist and die by the thousands in a war they had by and large been dragged kicking and screaming to. He was a fairly poor laborer working in the Welsh city of Swansea, and wished to dissuade several other groups of young working class men from joining the British war effort. These activities caught the attention of the order of the white feather, and earned him a visit from a group of them one night when he was walking to his tenant home near the harbor. They accosted him for being a \"coward\" and being unwilling to defend his homeland. He responded that Wales hadn't been \"his\" homeland since the time of Edward the third, and that even today the English crown send young men like himself to die in the pursuit of their own aims. He then asked them if it would be cowardly to defend his homeland against the much closer threat of English cultural imperialism, at which point the women pinned the white feather into his hat and walked away in disgust. I bring this up because I feel that a lot of people tend to forget that this is still the case for celtic ethnic groups in the UK. Britons, Picts, Scots, and the Welsh might have some level of freedoms assigned to each but that doesn't change the fact that for many of these groups there has been a long history of state sanctioned violence and repression on the part of the English against them. Still to this very day, Wales and northern Ireland do not have home rule even though the Brits decided to give such privileges to the Scottish. And while these areas have managed to hold onto a separate identity independent of English or British identity, that came at the expense of Welsh and Scots standing up against a systemic attempt to rid the world of celtic identity, history, as well as even our own goddamned names. I was shocked to find out that my quaint English sounding last name carried a much longer lineage with it than I ever really thought.",

Frankly, I was taught that most of the stories about Belgium, were British propaganda, and that there was a lot of enthusiasm and exuberance, belief in the valour of war. And casualty figures were suppressed. That's all true, but you've really laid out the development in a much more rational way. It's no longer a story of: weren't people crazy back then. And now it's a story of: this is how sane people drove themselves towards madness. And it is important to learn this all at this time now, when propaganda is evolving in new ways we don't yet understand.\n\nPlease make the next part about WW2! I know it must be a lot of work to do, you put in incredible detail. Thank you! You're providing many of us English speakers deep insights into German Social History. Even in the 1970s and 80s when I was a child, so much of what we learned about Germany was still hidden by the propaganda. Monty Python's caricatures of of Nazis, Hollywood WW2 movies.

    "text": "\"Cattle for Flanders\"\n\nWhile the Second World War was obviously much more horrible than the first, numerically speaking, I really think there's something about the way the horror of the Great War is expressed that gives it a much bleaker look. Few things in World War 2 capture the poetically crushing sadness of In Flanders Fields or All Quiet on the Western Front.\nI think it can be blamed on the complete and utter _absurdity_ of World War 2, as well as (obviously) the way that it's been treatd in culture since. Like, we as people can at least somewhat _comprehend_  what it felt like to be a soldier in the trenches on the western front, not being sure if the grinding monotony was preferable or worse than the periods of chaotic, terrifying yet relatively brief action. We can never truly understand what it was like, of course, but we can at least get an idea of it. I don't think the same can be said for the absurd extent of how utterly horrific the holocaust was. As Stalin (allegedly) said, when one man dies, that's a tragedy, when thousands die, that's a statistic.\n\nThis is not to downplay either the holocaust or the first world war. Just an observation on how the two wars seem to be viewd in modern culture, the former generally being viewed as a pointless, monotonous yet intensely traumatising grind, while the latter is viewed as a more frenetic, hollywood-esque war. One is Band of Brothers, the other is _Im Westen nichts Neues_",

This video a beautiful exploration of that psychology, even though it’s not your focus.
