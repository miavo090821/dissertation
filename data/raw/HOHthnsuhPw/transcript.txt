hey guys today I want to talk about branding and the biggest obstacle that the alt-right faces which keeps them from entering the mainstream in any significant way and that is the historical precedent that their ideas set in Germany in which everyone in the West is taught in school as soon as the old right talks about things like white identity and a homeland for their people the average person smells the stench of Nazism coming from them the biggest problem they have is that the public already knows what the alt-right wants and where their ideas will lead today I want to examine a couple of approaches that the odd ride uses to get rid of this association as far as I can see there are three main groups in the odd right there are people like Tara McCarthy who don't deny things like the Holocaust and it's extremely funny to see her clash with her ideological appears over this from time to time I'm actually a generation survivor believe it or not you know I I do have compassion and empathy toward other ethnic groups but I also have compassion and empathy toward fourth generation well this part of the odd ride is not interesting for today's topic so let's look at the other two and then we have people like Richard Spencer and spent most of their time advertising for the odd right from time to time he runs into the problem I described earlier and pay attention how he responds will you denounced Adolf Hitler I heard you don't denounce Adolf Hitler when asked about that ate off National Socialism was it was a was a disaster the 20th century was a pretty much a disaster yeah but do you denounce the action of Adolf Hitler I'm not gonna get I'm not gonna get I'm not gonna play this game oh it's not a game throw out historical figures and I denounce them I mean do you denounce Stalin do you denounce Pol Pot I mean look yeah the the National Socialist Germany it's part of history it's it's not who I am note how he acts kind of backward by the question and gives us an answer that could be interpreted in several different ways well he doesn't announce the crimes of the Nazi regime his answer could be used as a shield whenever someone accuses him of being a Nazi namely that he calls National Socialism the disaster of the 21st century and even if he pretends to not really understand why he's even asked this question you can be sure his response is something he thought about a lot he then goes on to ask the interviewer if he he denounces Stalin and with that wants to make it look just as legitimate as to ask him if he denounces Hitler he wants to give the watch that the impression that there is no connection at all to what happened in Germany 70 years ago and what he's tried to achieve later and the interview with David Pakman which had Spencer actually hints at why he doesn't address this issue at all not going to be burdened by history the factors that which had Spencer and the entire movement he represents is burned by history in a major way and they desperately want to cleanse themselves of the association with Nazi Germany the way Spencer wants to achieve this is to avoid the subject altogether because simply speaking about it manifests a certain image in the bystanders mind that's why interviews like this where Whichard spends us essentially selling his ideology it's really good for the art right while stuff like this is disastrous for them the last group in the old right are people like Mike Enoch who instead of avoiding the topic work on establishing the Holocaust as a myth and by extension removing part of the negative image of Nazi Germany to also lift the burden of his movement and if you if you actually listen to somebody talk about the gas chambers the way that narrative is constructed is sort of the way that conspiracy theories are constructed the first part of this process is to evoke skepticism about key aspects of the Holocaust and people like Andy and then to move on from there once they have reached the goal to convince the audience that maybe there were no gas chambers so yeah all y'all are very interesting [ __ ] I'd never heard this angle before yahzee the next step is drawing a moral equivalence between the Allies and the axis by comparing the internment of Jews to the internment of Japanese making Nazi Germany looked just as reasonable as the u.s. at that time this way they can present world war two as just like any other war while cloaking the terrible things that happened in the Third Reich as collateral damage to the war effort something that supposedly happens in every war this yeah I mean a state rounding up a potentially subversive enemy population within its own borders during a war is not really something the US think it's an entirely big group or to fight the u.s. what did u.s. German or to fight those Japanese would have stopped did you do the us put Italians and Germans in camps they just don't tell you that because they're white this trivializing of the horrors of the nazi regime also serves a secondary purpose though even if you have someone convinced that World War two was just like any other war you do not necessarily have him convinced that fascism as a desirable political goal here the groundwork of Mike's previous claims comes in handy since it allows him to not only present the Holocaust as thoughts or misrepresented but as a lie and a tool about the Jewish community who dominate over what he perceives as the white race like these all these lurid really graphic lurid tells it frankly what do they say Jews can come up with like [ __ ] movie scripts right they sound like something from a movie and who makes movies oh [ __ ] Jews this allows him true presenter white race as a victim and his proposals as a solution and in that sense the odds right is trying to make up ground in the same way that the Nazis did they present their society as a harmonious organic nation that is infected by an external intruder which threatens the survival of the race itself but you don't have to take my word for it let me read you two short quotes why the big lie what is his purpose in the first place it has been used to discourage any form of nationalism should the people of Britain or any other European country attempt to assert their patriotism and preserve their national integrity in an age when the very existence of nation-states is threatened they are immediately branded as neo-nazis because of course not season was nationalism and we all know what happened then six million Jews were exterminated so as long as the myth is perpetuated people everywhere will remain bondage to it the need for international tolerance and understanding will be hammered home by the United Nations until nationhood itself the very guarantee of freedom is abolished this is not the only way the radical right sees the Holocaust as a burden for their movement in their mind the Jews want to weaken Western society through immigration and with the Holocaust as a tool to reach that many countries of the anglo-saxon world notably Britain and America are today facing the gravest danger in the history the danger posed by the alien races in their midst unless something is done in Britain to halt the immigration and assimilation of Africans and Asian's into our country we are faced in the near future quite apart from the bloodshed of racial conflict with a biological alteration and destruction of the British people as they have existed here since the coming of the Saxons if you're familiar with odd right talking points this will not be the first time you heard these arguments especially the one of biological alteration I didn't get this text from fortune on all right subreddit though it is from a short pamphlet called did 6 million really die by neo-fascist and member of the British National Front which had Vera written in the mid 70s it demonstrates perfectly why Holocaust denial is an essential tool in the rebranding of the far-right and they're even true to a certain extent the Third Reich showed the entire world where the ideas such as the alright has can lead naturally mankind has learned from this experience and realized how bad these ideas are even if they sound like an easy solution to a complex set of problems when talking about the rebranding of far-right ideas there are a couple of ways they try to detach themselves from the association with the Nazis and Holocaust denial is only one of many tools like for instance constantly reinventing themselves as white nationalists or right or identitarian x' or the the left cause everyone they don't like nazi strop which is solely a tool to bring people to roll their eyes whenever the Nazi accusation is being made to ultimately remove the word from the conversation altogether although I will admit that the term Nazi is used more loosely than it used to be members of the odds right are not just being pedantic when saying things like Nazis only existed in the 30s and 40s as members of the National Socialist Workers Party it's all part of their goal of reinventing themselves they're people like Mike Enoch trivialized and flat-out lie about the crimes of the Nazis doesn't stem from a passionate love for Hitler well maybe it does to a certain extent but the focus lies on the strategic value for him to make Nazi Germany look good from this rity jaques standpoint it really doesn't matter to the odd right if the Holocaust happened because the burden it shifts on their ideas is the thing they want to get rid of and if you want to see this process of removing the burden actually work you just have to watch the stream of Mikey nock with anti-war ski which I will link in the description lucky for us though they are pretty dumb sometimes and can't contain themselves of giving Nazi salutes or chanting Jews will not replace us that's it for today's topic folks but I have a bit of housekeeping to do so you can stick around if you want the channel is getting close to 1,000 subscribers which is just insane to me I know compared to other channels this is practically nothing but for the time the channel exists and the amount of videos that are on it this is phenomenal and this is only due to you guys who spread these videos on reddit or Twitter and the like to discuss them I also really appreciate your feedback in the comments because it helps me get a better feel for you guys as an audience and speaking of which I was thinking about doing a Q&A when reaching the 1,000 subscribers I have no guarantee that there will be enough questions to do a video considering how small our community still is but we'll see I guess I've opened up a page on curious cat where you can post your questions if you want link is in the description and in my Twitter profile the next video is gonna be a bit more lighthearted here's a teaser hello and welcome back to no [ __ ] it won't be coming out before after next week though since I will be out of the country for a few days and with that I hope to see you next time have a good one
