        "text": "Stalin, Pol Pot and Mao were not progressives, if anything they longed for a mythological Golden Era when there countries were \"great\". Stalin regressed to a time of feudalism when a tiny minority controlled the lives of its citizens (and other countries it had conquered) were controlled from cradle to grave, Mao and Pol Pot were very much the same, progressives don't believe in quashing intellectual debate, most don't accept the use of science and technology for the furtherance of unlimited military usage. Progressives don't like the use of the Arts or media as simply propoganda tools. \n Regressives of the right seem, sadly, to be in the ascendant at the moment, a longing for a time when things were \"better\" is symptomatic of many of the current debates in the western democracies. This is because, I believe, because it is simpler to look backwards with nostalgia than it is to look forward with trepidation.\n The major challenges facing our world today are complex and need solutions which will be hard on everyone Climate Change, rising Inequality,Cyber-Terrorism and so on all require that we work together irrespective of national borders, creed or anything else which differentiates us. Sadly it is easier to claim that if we return to \" the good old days\" before any of this came into view everything will be allright.",

The first thing the Chinese communist did after taking power was attempt to industrialise China. You can’t establish communism without workers and industrialisation. I don’t know what Pol pot was trying to achieve with his rural utopia. Peasants and rural areas are viewed by communists as conservative and anti-communist which is why stalin disliked kulaks and peasants so much.  Peasants in Germany were far more likely to vote for nazis than German workers, so communists aren’t wrong to see peasants as being more anti-communist.",

Communism is a way of organizing, not a statement of goals. And in fact, Pol Pot was hardly the only Communist to redirect toward a rural ideal when in order to better control his people.

You can't simply change the labels around to try to create successes and remove failures.\r\n\r\n\"though authoritarian socialists 'won' over libertarian socialists in the well known, failed instances. \"\r\nThis is a common socialist trope.  It's false.  When the \"libertarian socialists\" (another complete oxymoron, as socialists attempt to hijack libertarianism) had their way--Ukraine, Catalonia, Paris, and others--it was still mostly murdering and starving.\r\n\r\n\"If you only call the latter true socialists, what would you call the former?\"\r\nSome false term, because the latter are also socialists.  They're just as true to socialism as the latter, and followed Marx' ideals better.\r\n\r\nSocialism is not one extremely-narrowly defined system, any more than I could say the USA doesn't have capitalism because I can't buy and sell heroin.  There are several varieties of socialism, and all of them are utter failures.\r\n\r\n\"But somehow your standard for democracies and anarchies seem to be dependant on the outcome conforming to those ideals\"\r\nIt ain't.  When the outcome of socialism conforms to the ideals of its founders (the ones they state, not their true \"punish people for being successful when I couldn't\" goals), the state is still a failure.\r\n\r\nAlso, socialism isn't being held to a different standard.  If democracy turned out to be a complete, miserable, tyrannical, deadly failure every single time it was tried without exception, then I'd be supporting monarchy.\r\n\r\n\"(Oh, is John Maynard Keynes a socialist to you?)\r\nOf course not.  Keynes was a power-hungry idiot who knew nothing of economics, but just because every socialist is a power-hungry idiot who knows nothing of economics, doesn't mean that every power-hungry idiot who knows nothing of economics is a socialist.\r\n\r\nKeynes wasn't a very good capitalist, and a society built according to his principles would drag with constant boom and bust cycles--but it would still be far better than any socialist system.",

(They did heavily criticise early socialists (coined utopian socialists) for believing democracy could work in and of itself in Germany, though.) Socialism supposedly leads to communism, when capitalism inevitably breaks down. (Which it obviously doesn't.) \n\n\n\nAnd yes, capitalism is more than just free-market-capitalism. \n\n\n\nReal socialists never effectively abolished capitalism per se.

It didn't create a utopia, but that's because socialism doesn't do that.\r\n\r\nWhen a rain dance doesn't make rain, we don't decide it must have been something with their technique; we acknowledge that rain dances don't work.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, socialism is a system in which control of the means of production is taken away from the people who created it.  Pretending that anything that you like is therefore socialist is just plain ridiculous.  \r\n\r\nAlso, the idea that socialism decouples power, knowledge, and freedom from personal wealth is equally ridiculous.  If you really want to see income inequality, look at any socialist country.\r\n\r\nLook at the Soviet Union, where Stalin had dozens of mansions and a staff of servants for each while half of Russian hospitals didn't have running water.\r\n\r\nLook at Venezuela, where Maduro's daughter has $4 billion in her bank account while the people literally fight over the best garbage-picking grounds.\r\n\r\nLook at North Korea, where the Kim dynasty tills tons of sugar into the soil to make their apples sweeter while the military has recently lowered their height requirements to 4'8\" because of malnutrition.  \r\n\r\nLook at Cuba, where Castro's family pretty much lives on yachts while 14- and 15-year-old girls are prostituting themselves for literally two bucks a throw.\r\n\r\nLook at China, where people with the right positions in government are raking in millions and sending their kids to American schools while those the government doesn't favor starve.\r\n\r\nIt's almost as funny as watching y'all talk about \"fighting imperialism\" when you refer to Cuba, North Korea, and other military outposts of the Soviet Union.\r\n\r\nIt's the same wishful thinking that has every socialist certain that he or she will be writing slam poetry For the People instead of working 15 hours a day in a crumbling steel mill and then coming home to help your wife shoo rats away from the baby.\r\n\r\n\"If democracy and socialism were mutually exclusive, Marx and Engels weren't socialists.

Corresponding to this is also a political transition period in which the state can be nothing but the revolutionary dictatorship of the proletariat\"\r\n\r\nThat's why socialist countries rant about the \"revolution\" and \"revolutionaries\" long after they've finished creating a socialist state.  As long as the revolution is still ongoing, the dictatorship is still necessary; for your own good.\r\n\r\nThat's why wherever socialism was installed, it was done so either by fraud or by force.  To claim that socialists support democracy is to be willfully blind.\r\n\r\nNote that Marx and Engels were both clear that some people would simply never become good socialists and would have to be \"eliminated.\"  Amusingly, they thought the Russians were one of those groups.",

(But you're probably going to disagree with me on that in some way ore another.) I'm somewhat more in favour of federalist concepts to accommodate our condition–as in being able to more or less comfortably navigate social groups of about 150 individuals–with the biggest problem being that we're a quite few magnitudes above that in population.",

Considering that Hitler himself continued to nationalize industries, endorse socialism, and viciously slander capitalism for years after, it seems that 'purge the socialism' thing didn't quite go far enough, but the simple truth is that Strasser tried to undercut Hitler--Hitler was offered the vice-chancellor spot, and when Hitler refused Strasser's advice and held out for the ultimate-power bit, Strasser tried to take the position himself, in what enemies were working up as a move to split the party.  Hitler purged Strasser for the same reason he purged the others, for the same reason dictators generally purge their parties---because he was a rival for power who had personally offended him.",

As well as easier voting for some (mail-ins) and both parties calling the 2020 election the \"most important election of our lifetimes.\" Even TRUMP beat obama, technically. By your logic, I could ask how a 74 year-old white man with a racist past and a homophobic white man as vp could beat obama, the previously most popular president by history. If your logic can be used to argue multiple sides, then it's probably not good logic.  \r\n\r\n\r\nIn short, I think that your point on not calling everyone \"nazis\" is agreeable. No need to call people who aren't nazis... nazis. The left-right political spectrum has a lot of flaws, but on that spectrum, fascism falls right.",

Now let me explain how the Motivation and application differ: \n\nHe was against Religion because he didn't want people to awnser to any authority higher than him. He wanted his authority to be the only body of worship allowed. I opposed all Religion because it is inkompatible with my secular values, is actively harmful and gives no benefits that cannot be reached through secular practice. No Religion should be able to actively run giant Money making schemes while not paying any taxes. No State should be allowed to break basic human rights on the Basis of Religion. So, yeah, I think organized Religion shouldn't be allowed to exist. \n\nSee, was that so hard? I can very easily and in good faith denounce Stalin, while Mr. Spencer can't do the same for Hitler because he knows he doesn't disagree and doing so would loose him a large part of his following.

What happened in America surely can.\"\nMy examples were of expulsions, there are plenty of genocides in Europe and all around the world, so fuck off with your dishonesty.  An incomplete list:\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genocides_in_history#Europe\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_genocides_by_death_toll\nI notice I am the only one providing sources here, you just keep making outlandish claims without any evidence.\n\n\"He did indeed make similar statements. Now let me explain how the Motivation and application differ\"\nLOL You realize this was just me making your guilt by association fallacy to prove a point, but now you are actually distracted by it...\n\n\"He was against Religion because he didn't want people to awnser to any authority higher than him. He wanted his authority to be the only body of worship allowed.\"\nMany people need a higher power to look to, when you take away religion this leave the state to fill that vacuum.\n\n\"I opposed all Religion because it is inkompatible with my secular values, is actively harmful and gives no benefits that cannot be reached through secular practice.\"\nDon't care.  Many people do find value in religion, you sill haven't justified your claims that they are all equally bad.\n\n\"No Religion should be able to actively run giant Money making schemes while not paying any taxes.\"\nWho are you to tell people what they can or cannot do with their own money?  That said I find their tax advantage to be unfair to other groups who must pay taxes.\n\n\"No State should be allowed to break basic human rights on the Basis of Religion.\"\nA meaningless statement without defining \"basic human rights\" especially considering that freedom of religion is considered a \"human right\" by many.\n\n\"I can very easily and in good faith denounce Stalin, while Mr. Spencer can't do the same for Hitler because he knows he doesn't disagree and doing so would loose him a large part of his following.\"\nMoving the goal post now are we, after I said \"Why should I care who supposedly makes some similar argument?\" referring to MY argument, not to something Spencer said.\n\n \"just further indication that everyone left of where you stand sounds the same to you.\"\nLOL, we have come full circle now haven't we, you are now whining that I seem to think people on the left sound similar, when before you were accusing me of using the same arguments as some other people on the right.  Life comes at you fast.  The best part about this is you are the only hypocritical one were since I admitted that I had made an assumption based on my experience; I never said that \"everyone\" sounds the same, I said \"more then not\", but nice strawmen.\n\nAnyway, its been fun letting you own yourself with your own bullshit, but I really am finding nothing enlightening about this conversation.",

I oppose organized religion. (which, to be honest, is a double statement, as religion just means organized faith. so, organized organized faith I guess, hence why i didn´t feel the need to specify that i was in fact, refering just to the organized aspect of it. ) My statements do not conflict with freedom of religion.\n\n\"Moving the goal post now are we, after I said \"Why should I care who supposedly makes some similar argument?\" referring to MY argument, not to something Spencer said. \" sorry there, I actually mistook what the original point of contention was, (happens sometimes) but the same actually still applies to you as it does spencer.  \n\n\"The best part about this is you are the only hypocritical one were since I admitted that I had made an assumption based on my experience; I never said that \"everyone\" sounds the same, I said \"more then not\", but nice strawmen.\" \nan assumption based on an expireince is still an assumption. this doesn´t change the fact that YOU did, in fact, strawman ME. I could just as easily tell assume based on experience that you are an anit-semite, since most people I´ve heard uttering your arguments were. Surely you wouldn´t approve of that or would you? \nI find it puzzling that you think my argument on having to explain your position when youre saing something other people in extremist groups usually say is complete inanity, but when you just assume, based on what I said about something else, incinuate that I must also therefore have a certain opinion on islam based on that. \n\nYOU´RE the one who´s \"owning yourself with your own bullshit\" I´ve not once criticsed you for doing something that i do myself or done something that i criticise you for doing. Where are you seeing the hipocracy?\n\n\"Many people do find value in religion, you sill haven't justified your claims that they are all equally bad. \" Many people find value in faith healing, but it is still harmful.\n\n\n\"LOL You realize this was just me making your guilt by association fallacy to prove a point, but now you are actually distracted by it...\" No...... I am demonstrating to you why it´s important to think about ones own statements, how they can be interpreted and what they might be mistaken for. that´s something so basic anyone who has spent any time debating should have done at some point. Why are you so resistant to explainations ?  Also, Guilt by association is based on condemming someone based on the people they know, interact with or are otherwise connected to. not based on what they say...... are you even trying to take me seriously? cause I´m having trouble doing the same for you as this conversation goes on.\n\nand on the genociedes you listed, two of these I did in fact not know about, thank you for actually telling me of them, but you´re missing the point. my point was never: \"only white people commit genocide.\" It was: \"the genocides in america and australia is far more gruesome and not compareble to any of those that happened in europe.\" \nDo you disagree with that?\n\nAnd I do apolagise for saying that none of them were genocides, as I was working with a definitionthat was a bit extreme and had more explicit criteria. for example: it has to be a deliberate attempt to eradicate a people from the face of the earth, which it wasn´t in most cases on this list. I don´t consider any one sided armed conflict genocide. some of the conflicts you mentioned are actually debated on wether or not they can actually be considered genocide. People actually have widely different opinions on when something starts being a genocide. In my own one, if the intent of extermination specifically cannot be proven, I am not convinced. \n\nI hope you can actually understand my position now, but, as you´ve repeatadly demonstrated, you can and will do anything to make my arguments sound simple and stupid so you can have an easier time insulting them. \n\n\"I really am finding nothing enlightening about this conversation.\" You and me both my friend, you and me both.",

We could mention events in which non-socialist countries made concentration camps (like Nazi Germany and 20s Brazil) and also socialist experiences which never had them (the EZLN and Rojava being the most visible ones in the current world). What enables them is the conccentration of political power (the State) in partnership with economical power (Capital), normally made much easier when this power resides in one or just a few cultures when many more cultures are present (like white germans in a Germany which had jewish and romani people, for example). So, what I am against is the concentration of political and economical power, as well as any social* hierarchies.",

Just because they said a few things that I agreed with I was suddenly allowing myself to ignore all of their demonstrable bullshit that I knew I didn't buy into. \n\nSo while you probably won't be able to rationally convince the irrational reactionaries, conspiracy theorists and hardline bigots I think content like yours acts like a well-deserved slap in the face to those that should and usually do know better and it's always nice watching right-wingers get demolished.....

When it comes to invalidating experiences of men, most feminists see men and women as being equally valid in their experience, but simply women as in a worse position than men due to the patriarchy and thus in need of more attention, care and etc. Feminists who do dismiss and invalidate men are often trans-exclusionary-radical-feminists (TERFs), but these people are in a great minority and should not make you reject the movement as a whole. \nIt should also be noted that most other feminists reject TERFs as well.",

Other conservatives did, and still do, adhere to principles and myths that capitalism will always magically and naturally fix itself, like examples in physics, biology, and religion.\n\nBut the problem was the collapse of DEMAND (refuting Says Law that Supply always creates Demand), which is always partly fueled by credit-creation (out of thin air) as well as Govt spending (out of thin air).\n\nYour point about encouraging idleness and stupidity is noted.\n\nThat raises the last point, that Govt spending CANNOT come from wealthy people, as no person of wealth or labor has ever created even one United States Dollars. (Nor has China. They spend to create and distribute Yuan.)\n\nTaxes too high a/o net spending too low is always now the cause of unemployment. *Govt has infinite means to spend as needed* when bank credit creation is weak or in contraction. We know this from 20th century decades of war, including Cold War spending totaling $12 Trillion after 1945. That $12 Trillion was mostly added to the US economy, under patriotism. (Not sure what it would be in today's dollars.)\n\n(The economy does not have infinite capacity to utilize infinite annual fiscal deficits. There's not infinite shit to buy.)\n\nBut if Trickle Down worked as stated, those with little or no money would be able to boost GDP by going shopping if for example Congress gave one man, Donald Trump, his entire $5 Trillion fiscal deficit, to spend personally as he saw fit.\n\nNor is consumption boosted effectively when corporate tax cuts go to stock buyback schemes, which used to be barred as fraud. That is, using corporate windfalls to artificial manipulate share prices up, creating frenzy, and fattening gains for executive shareholders.\n\nThis has nothing in common with traditional concepts of noble capitalism: investments, improvements, production, and sales of useful products to consumers. It's more pure financial gimmickry writ large, more like Madoff, not like Sanders.",

        "text": "sorry wordsof harmony, but you haven't quite got it right.\nBeing a communist is naturally extreme, it's just that many of the proponents we're exposed to are reasonably well-raised, involved w/ arts/humanities in University and are products of a mixed economy & state, resulting in their conduct being much like everyone else's, broadly speaking. Though there's also the unapologetically thuggish communists in the likes of Antifa, whom the previously mentioned communists almost universally support.\nThat is evidence of natural extremity right there, in that when it comes to tactics not dissimilar from what the extremist political groups of the 20th century employed, there's a dedicated sect willing to do the same in the name of THEIR cause, while the rest of the group are quite happy about it and will do nothing to stop it - and some end up joining in as it becomes normalised and the social propaganda flows.\nMany communists do not believe themselves to be inherently violent, naturally extreme or vicious or what-have-you, because in their minds they're taking a stand against what they perceive to be the evils of the profit-driven, industrialized No-Mans-Land that regards people as little more than economic units, which disgusts the communists' sensibilities.\nThey hate those that actively praise and propel the capitalist system and come to look upon those who don't care w/ a unique loathing.\nThe communist in practice is a vile and vicious creature, largely due to its' believing that its' efforts are in everyone's' best interests.\nThose who would stamp on the workers' revolution? it's for the greater good that they are taken out. It's the very belief that they are relieving humanity of the perilous, evil matrix of capitalism that ensures extremity once things are underway and there are stakes.\n\nWhat you said about Nazis is mainly true, though only because you used the word Nazi instead of the term National Socialist or Fascist.\nTo the Nazi (while it's short for National Socialist we know someone using the word is referencing a person who is partial to Hitlers slant) the use of violence in some capacity is required as the goals of the Party were to remove Jews and Slavs from Europe.\nThat COULD be done w/o genocide, at least theoretically... unlikely as it is, but it couldn't be done w/o a degree of violence.\nFascism and/or National Socialism, however, do not HAVE to involve such extremes. In part, this is because Fascism is not a real ideology, but a kind of collection of sentiments and tactics that aren't concrete. It's really a term that's more useful for the audience/the critic than anyone else as it is used more or less to get the alarms ready once certain tactics and the like are observed.\nI've heard that there were many who eagerly joined up w/ the Nazis, once Germany had taken Europe, who didn't care for the vicious hatred of Slavs that many of the Germans - Hitler especially - had, but really resonated w/ the socio-cultural aspects. There have been rather a few peoples who've operated very similarly to the National Socialist way in their tribes/societies, w/o the need, or want, for genocide.\nMany in subsequent years have come to regard the internal mechanics of Nazi Germany as optimal for a society, though of course they tend to not include the blatant eugenics and all the rest.",

Lenist/Stalinist-Soviet communism (so pretty much all kind of communism because it was the guideline for other communists) views itself as an international REVOLUTION and yes those are always violent. Even when you go back to Marxism in \"Das Kapital\" Marx very much pointed out that the proletariat would rise up in a revolution. Textbook Communism is violent.\n\n\nThis however doesnt mean that Socialism needs to be violent. The proletariat could take over the economy without a revolution in theory, but in that case I wouldnt call it communism because they that is a serious change from Marxs textbook and from Soviet guidelines.

        "text": "Weston Meyer \"As for YouTube algorithms, that is mostly used to keep right wing content that YouTube feels is dangerous away from the public.\" That alone damn sure does make your whole comment look like the comment of conspiracy theorist. I mean youtube uses different algorithms, but their main algorithm maximises watch time and if youtube really wanted to keep right wing content off their site then why is there so much right wing content with that many views? If they actually wanted they could make it so that nobody would watch right wing content. Then youtube has the demonetization algorithm and again that one hits many different channels and mostly hits very controversial content for their image, but as far as I see right wing conetnt isnt hit much more often than other content and even if it did then that wouldnt stop the people from watching it. It would only make right wing content less profitable.\n\"I get mostly left wing loonies when it comes to my suggested videos even though I spend about an equal amount of time on left wing and right wing channels.\" Yeah, but that is not intentional. It just seems like the youtube algorithm thinks that you would watch more left wing content then right wing content. Even the programmers of the algorithm cant tell you why that is because it is a neural network type of algorithm, nobody programmed that algorithm because it is created by another algorithm therefore any bias towards left wing content is caused by the fact that that maximises watch timme, There is no human created bias in this.\n \nMany leftists, no most leftists, would agree with you that there is a huge problem with islamic terrorism and that Islam needs to reform, but a phobia is an irrational fear and enough people fear islamic people more than rational. Generalising and condemning all forms of Islam is irrational and a fair use of the word islamophobia and the reason why there is no christianophobia is that the least amount of people actually fear Christianity because christianity had to reform for a long time in our modern society. Christianity reformed to fit into most of our modern values while Islam didnt yet. Because of this and the fact that Christianity is a very traditional part of western society nobody (almost) fears Christianity. That still doesnt mean that we cant critisze it where critizism might be needed.\n\n\"Whether what you are talking about is healthcare, immigration, abortion, gay marriage, environmental issues, education,\"\nOk, \nHealthcare is a good example here. \nSo the left in your country want to bring in public healthcare to fuck you over? The life expectancy in the USA is actually quite low and all those countries with their public health care are better than the USA.\nThe average life expectancy in the EU for men is even higher than the life expectancy in the USA for men and women (women live longer).\nhttps://www.laenderdaten.info/lebenserwartung.php\nWell, ok then people in the USA probably spend less on health care right? Look for yourself. You almost spend twice the amount of germany per capita and I am pretty certain this includes the insurancy that we have to pay as taxes. \nhttps://www.healthsystemtracker.org/chart-collection/health-spending-u-s-compare-countries/#item-start\nBig Pharma is a USA thing because of big old unregulated capitalism.\nIn what way does the left fuck you over in terms of abortion? Abortion is a question of morality and I dont see how you yourself get fucked over there, can you explain?\nThe same goes for gay marriage.\nSaving our environment is a big issue and science backs this up.\n\"teaching white kids to hate themselves and their families\" source?\n\n\"country that literally censors everything and everyone who isn’t fully on board with the radical left.\" I as a german have NO idea what you are talking about. The leading party for the last decade, wait pretty much since our founding after WW2 is slightly on the right end of our political spectrum. The C in CDU/CSU stands for CHRISTIAN. The party called \"Die Linke\" (=The left) has never been in government as far as I remember. The CDU is conservative. The marxist lenninist party never even gets enough votes to get into parliament. The radical left in germany is weaker than the radical right at the moment. The only semi strong left party is \"Die Grüne\"(=The green) and they really didnt get anything major done yet.\n\"germany has been destroyed countless times by the left since the Nazis were defeated\" lmao give me one example.\n\"German women are being raped in the streets\" The rates did increase, but criminal refugees get kicked out. The problem is just that the process of kicking them out is long and hard which is why this problem exists. I know that many refugees get kicked out because that happned to some refugees I knew. What exactly do you want our govenment to do? The have a right to immigrate if they are actual refugees. Also dont make it look like the rates increased through the sky. Nobody wants to downplay the problems that arose from the refugee crisis, but some americans make it look like we are run over.\nhttps://de.statista.com/statistik/daten/studie/1587/umfrage/vergewaltigung-und-sexuelle-noetigung/\nWhen I compare our rate to the USA rate in 2010 we are still good, however comparing rape rates is diffucult because the amount of unreported sexual assaults.\n\"These European leftists are especially stupid because anything and anyone that isn’t within their realm of control is banned, censored, fined etc out of existence, they have never been challenged on any political rhetoric that pops into their head.\" Any example? The only thing censored in germany is racism and parties that violate our constitution which forbids \"hate speech\". You know the constitution made under USAs influence.",

Also because our unemployment rate is so low, I dont know where the problem lies with our immigration policy. In summary you are allowed to migrate 1. if you have a high school diploma or are a skilled labour accepted by german standards with a secure job offering. 2. You are a skilled labour, academic for 6 months to search for a job if you can prove that you have a secure income for this time. Those are pretty much the biggest ways for actual immigration.\n\nMerkel is Christian from what I can tell and what she says (voted against gay marriage if I remember correctly) and the CDU is conservative in our political landscape. \nBTW, do you realize that literally anything can be declared “hate speech”?  Yeah, yeah, you are right, but the actual mostly used word is \"Volksverhetzung\" Maybe hate speech doesnt convey the full meaning. \n\"sedition pol.\r\ndemagoguery pol.\r\nhate crime\r\nhate speech\r\nrabble-rousing\r\nincitement of the people law\r\nincitement of the masses\"\nThis becomes a bit more specific now. \n\"Do you realize that families of rape victims are censored on social media for “hate speech”?\" Source?",

        "text": "@chris-bacon205 I think the reasons behind my support for nationalism are the preservation of the culture, traditions, language, and wisdom of the people that have lived here for far longer than I have. They have a way to, for example, bake bread, and this way is the way that we like it, hence that is the way its shared over generations. Also, nationalism gives the people of a nation a sense of objective and unity, which helps everyone in the nation cooperate with one another. And leaving the philosophical aside, nationalism helps the nation preserve its sovereignty. We can see such examples for example in the Irish Revolution, the Zionist movement, or the dissolution of the Soviet Union. I know there are a lot of types of nationalism that I am not aware of, but a bit of nationalism in the minds of the people of the nation is not bad. I of course denounce radical nationalism, like the one that lead to the holocaust, so I think there should be a balance.\n\nSorry for bad English, it is a second language to me. Thanks.",

To put it simply if you do something good for a bad reason you can as easily do something bad for a bad reason.

The way you speak evokes images of Stanley Tucci as the gentle doctor Erskine telling Steve to be a good man. I know.
