        "text": "I had a similar conversation with a co-worker who tried try talk about Trans issues with me once out of no where. He was probably all fired up about something he saw on Fox News the night before. He is a 61 year old Conservative white guy but he is not a bad person. He is just mis-informed and has brain rot from the news. He started going off about his concern that maybe 1 of 10 trans persons just trying to get into the womens bathroom or something of that sort. I cut him off and said “I judge people by my own experience with said person or group.” At the time I knew there was a Trans Man we worked with. They put a lock in one of the mens restrooms for their ease of mind. So I told him “My only experience with a Trans person is our co-worker and it has been pleasant, They keep to themselves and the only accomodation they made for them isnt even in our building. Why would I feel any type of way about them?” He then informed me there is another Trans person in the company. I told him “You further proved my point I wasnt even aware of this persons existance”. He relunctantly agreed and moved on. I know not all situations are this easy to handle. People on both sides of this issue can be annoying and crazy. I have only spoke with my co-worker 4 times as I said they work in another building. I would not think twice about helping/speaking out for them in there was any injustice or persecution of them or any other human being. That being said my older co-worker and myself are not perfect, we all need to be empathetic and understanding, my world view has also grown everyone needs to be given that opportunity.",

        "text": "Yes, it's disgusting. Trans people are a tiny, tiny minority with virtually no political power of their own. Without the support of cisgender people, they are virtually powerless against bigots and bigoted systems. And of course, they're causing no inherent harm by being trans.\n\nI try to call out anti-trans bigots who conveniently switched from being homophobes after same-sex legal marriage became a national phenomenon and Western civilization didn't collapse. They're foul people who need groups to target with bigotry. One typically didn't hear a peep from them about trans people, when bigotry against gays and lesbians was more socially acceptable. But they quickly and vigorously accepted a new target in trans people, when the right wing offered them up.  \n\nThey aren't just misguided people - they're foul people who are intent on being foul to certain groups of people. And it isn't necessarily the case that they're no longer homophobes - in fact, it's more likely that they just don't voice their homophobia in mixed company because it isn't socially acceptable in many circles. Look at misogyny - the overwhelming majority of Americans would say that they oppose it and they believe in equal rights for women and girls. Yet, misogyny is still a major problem in our society and blatant misogyny is still often expressed in like-minded social circles. People don't necessarily reveal their true thoughts, when they have reason to believe that they will get a lot of pushback. And as we've seen with Republican politicians, they were quiet about gays and lesbians until they determined that homophobes regained enough power to target gays and lesbians with legislation and case law. Don't make the mistake of thinking that they're only going to target trans people, or LGBTQ people. They're going to continue to target ethnic minorities (especially black people), women, etc. - whenever they think that they have the power to do so.",

But wanting to deny 9 trans people the right to use the public restroom, in which they feel most comfortable, because 1 cisgender man will allegedly dress up like a woman to go into a women's restroom is pretty bad. Claiming that 1 actual trans person committing a crime supports discrimination against 9 innocent trans people would still be absurd, but it would make more sense than your coworker's statement.\n\nI think that we need to stop covering for these people. Lots of bigots have been nice to people they weren't bigoted against. The people who supported racial segregation and who even had picnics at lynchings of black men, women, and children weren't foaming at the mouth all of the time. Many were loving parents, partners, friends, etc. So were some of the people who actually conducted the lynchings. So were some of the people who enslaved other people, who massacred Native Americans, etc. But being bigoted makes bigots terrible people, in my opinion.\n\nAnd in this case, your coworker is bigoted against a tiny, tiny minority group that's causing no inherent undue harm and has virtually no political power to protect themselves without the support of cisgender people. And I would bet that your coworker had more to say against trans people but didn't feel comfortable saying it to you. I wouldn't take his silence as an indication that he changed his mind.",

There was way more uproar when we switched back to ADP from Palocity for Payroll. That is the real stuff people care about.

I know that some cisgender girls or women athletes don't. But the ones I've seen propped up by the media weren't even very good. Like there was a cisgender high school girl who complained about a trans girl participating in a track invitational, claiming that the trans girl kept her out of the finals of her event and cost her a chance at a scholarship.  Again, this was an invitational - not a state championship or a national meet. This cisgender girl wasn't going to increase her chances of getting a college scholarship by finishing 8th instead of 9th at an invitational. And there were 7 other cisgender girls who were also faster than her and \"kept her out of the finals.\" \n\nAnd a common theme in the opposition to trans girls and women in girls' and women's sports is the notion that trans girls and women are just Mike Tyson, Michael Phelps, or Usain Bolt wearing a wig. And included in that is the notion that all males are inherently better in all sports than all females.  My sister, who was a sprinter, was faster than almost all boys and men. And she wasn't even one of the fastest female sprinters in the nation at any level. But the overwhelming majority of males aren't fast sprinters. And a trans girl or woman isn't necessarily fast, either. Even if she is, it isn't necessarily because she's trans.",

When asked why they detransitioned, only 5% of respondents typically say 'regret' as their motivator, with the overwhelming majority (90+%) saying they're detransitioning due to costs or due to family/friends/employers treating them worse after transitioning. If you put that into real  UK numbers (as an example), it equates to about 600 people out of approximately 262,000 transgender people 'regretting' detransition. And that's in a country where a new referral can currently see you waiting 7+ years for an initial consultation\n\nPeople who regret transitioning deserve help and support; using them as a weapon against the majority of people who seek and don't regret that care says a lot more about someone's views on trans people than it does their compassion for detransitioners",

More generally, sex differentiation of the female fetus is governed by the lack of a present, or functioning, SRY-gene on either one of the respective sex chromosomes. Female anatomy is distinguished from male anatomy by the female reproductive system, which includes the ovaries, fallopian tubes, uterus, vagina, and vulva. The adult female pelvis is wider, the hips broader, and the breasts larger than that of adult males.

Why, suddenly, do you care about the rights of illegal aliens? Is it because it's politically convenient? I'm trying to see if there's any merit to leftism. You could convince me.",

More generally, sex differentiation of the female fetus is governed by the lack of a present, or functioning, SRY-gene on either one of the respective sex chromosomes. Female anatomy is distinguished from male anatomy by the female reproductive system, which includes the ovaries, fallopian tubes, uterus, vagina, and vulva. The adult female pelvis is wider, the hips broader, and the breasts larger than that of adult males. Women have significantly less facial and other body hair, have a higher body fat composition, and are on average shorter and less muscular than men.\n\nA man is an adult male human.\nPrior to adulthood, a male human is referred to as a boy (a male child or adolescent). \nLike most other male mammals, a man's genome inherits an X chromosome from the mother and a Y chromosome from the father. Sex differentiation of the male fetus is governed by the SRY gene on the Y chromosome. During puberty, hormones which stimulate androgen production result in the development of secondary sexual characteristics, thus exhibiting greater differences between the sexes. These include greater muscle mass, the growth of facial hair and a lower body fat composition.",

Please consider that the core identity of Jewishness is not tied to child murdering but to a cultural background with very little implicit evilness of that sort. Not all jews drink child blood. Therefore, not all Jews deserve to be starved, crowded, treated as subhuman, and killed in various painful ways. Literally evil for implying that Jews should've been exterminated because some of their ancestors might've killed children.\n\nIt's like if the justice system executed a serial killer's son because his father was a horrible piece of trash.

They were referred to as the tritriya pakriti, and if you know anything about SE Asian history during the next millennia plus, you'll know that Indians and their Kama Sutra made it all the way from India to Indonesia (skipping China, Japan, Korea, and basically just all of East Asia), spreading their religion and philosophy the entire time. \n\nCoincidentally, every place they touched back then has an uninterrupted history of trans people or third genders (or sometimes many more than 3 genders) that continues in most of those regions even today. \n\nAlmost as old is the tradition of the hijra, another name for a trans woman. But they're legally considered a gender in places as varied as Nepal, Pakistan, India, and Bangladesh to this day, even appearing as an option on passports. \n\nSo there we go. More than two thousand years of largely  uninterrupted existence of trans people, covering quite literally almost half the damned globe.

I can quantify it easily, cause I made a statistic on a germany media channel (FUNK) and they show 8% transpeople in all their stuff 2022.\nWe dont have 8% transpeople in germany so its overrepresentated. (we have like 160 000 and a total population of 82 000 000)\nYou got like 1,2 million and have a total population of 320 million people. So you got like 0,4% trans people. And I would bet your media shows more than 0,4% trans people in total.\nAnd why is it a problem?\nWell first there comes a politisation and moralization with it. Each topic where it is shown becomes political a moral debate.\nLots of studies show that consumers want to see authentic diversity.\nOverrepresentation enforces stereotypes, cause you need stereotypes in ads.\nTopics get bigger than they are. You got 160 000 trans people and every american has to know what that is and has to know what trans-ideology is. Or how they have to behave if they meet one. Most people dont in their life.\nAnd overrepresentation awakens fear in some people. They feel alienated.\n\n\n2.\nNo I dont believe leftists are „friends“ with nor „in cahoots“ with big pharma and corps. They just underestimate the power of advertisement and how rich you can get through LGBTQ-marketing. So leftists are more useful idiots that do whatever these guys want. They just have to label something as „morally good thing to do“ and leftists do it. Works with almost everything.\nWhat do you think, who is the better customer? A healthy being or a child that has to take puberty blockers and then hormone blockers + opposite sex hormones + meds against the side effecs life long? What would you do if you were big pharma, would you say your meds help or would you tell them they dont enhance your QoL?\nHow about surgical transition, the more the merrier?\nCan you acknowledge that big pharma doenst care about people, but only about profits?",

If a person claims to be a man or  a woman, it can be tested by examining the genitals or checking the chromosome pairs. Identity is not simply a matter of trust.\n\nBe that as it may, it is not wise to blindly trust people when it comes to claims even about personal tastes.There are frauds who use such techniques to try to get your confidence and then swindle. Real trust takes time to build.\n\nWhich brings me to your case. What about claiming to be trans? It cannot be verified. So a person can lie about being trans and one can never know. So are you lying about being trans? There is no way to verify. But let me tell you this, if you believe your claim to be trans, you were most likely swindled. \n\n\"why would someone radically reshape their entire life and relationships with other people, end up tangled in an obnoxiously complicated medical system?\" It is a good question, and I can answer it. To start with,  you do not have to do any of that to claim to be trans. Just declare that it is what you are and you can enter any public bathroom you choose. An open invitation to perverts. So the question about pretend trans is very important.\n\nLet it be so, called trans-people end up doing the radical reshaping in many cases. That is one of the objectives of those that propagate this ideology, so it makes sense. So why do people go through it? They were induced to do so.  Because they and their parents are tricked into beleving that if they don't do it, you will end up committing suicide. It is a simple scare tactic, but it works. Meanwhile your body has been irreversibly changed with all the \"therapy\". You have become their milch cattle. Now you are entrenched in this delusion and even if you free your mind, your body is broken forever. Still, most people don't fall for the bait, but you did.\n\nYou are not the target here. You are just a pawn. Not used by the conservatives, but by the so called liberals who use you to accumulate power on your behalf. Conservatives are worried that the same blackmail will be used by the medical mafia to target their child. Their actions are purely defensive.

Denoting the sex that can bear offspring or produce eggs, distinguished biologically by the production of gametes (ova) which can be fertilized by male gametes. Women inherit a pair of X chromosomes from their parents, and are capable of pregnancy and giving birth from puberty until menopause. More generally, sex differentiation of the female fetus is governed by the lack of a present, or functioning, SRY-gene on either one of the respective sex chromosomes. Female anatomy is distinguished from male anatomy by the female reproductive system, which includes the ovaries, fallopian tubes, uterus, vagina, and vulva. The adult female pelvis is wider, the hips broader, and the breasts larger than that of adult males. Women have significantly less facial and other body hair, have a higher body fat composition, and are on average shorter and less muscular than men.\n\nA man is an adult male human.\nPrior to adulthood, a male human is referred to as a boy (a male child or adolescent). \nLike most other male mammals, a man's genome inherits an X chromosome from the mother and a Y chromosome from the father. Sex differentiation of the male fetus is governed by the SRY gene on the Y chromosome. During puberty, hormones which stimulate androgen production result in the development of secondary sexual characteristics, thus exhibiting greater differences between the sexes. These include greater muscle mass, the growth of facial hair and a lower body fat composition.",

The state's role is to ensure that right is protected, even when the parents would deny that right.  The state isn't usurping parental authority, it's guaranteeing the rights of children.\nI realize that results in the undermining of many of the ideas held by religious conservatives, but that's just the nature of the beast.

The conservative ideas I am referring to are religion agnostic. As an example, let's look at the topic of sex and gender norms, which seems to be the hot topic on this video comment section. You will find that roughly equivalent, traditional ideas of the masculine and feminine, and corresponding gender roles, existed in, and structured society in all prosperous civilizations throughout history, regardless of their respective religions. The modern, radical gender ideology posits that there are a cornucopia of fluid gender identities and that biological sex is irrelevant or in fact inscrutable; which is in stark contrast to the principles recognized by every successful civilization up to this point. These ideas are so evolutionarily unsound that they have only become economically and socially viable in very recent times, ironically, through the economic and social progress of those whom we deem backwards and unsophisticated. Therefore, I am skeptical of the long-term viability of such radical ideas.\n     I agree that children ought to have access to the best learning materials, ideally. Clearly, that is a proposition that anyone can agree with. But, how do you determine what is the \"best available information\"? By what standards are you determining that? And who exactly is in charge of determining that? You seem to be happy to have other people's children taught things against their parents will so long as it conforms to your ideology, but if the situation was reversed, would you be okay with your child being taught ideology you strongly disagree with with? Lastly, considering how inefficient, ineffective, and corrupt governments programs tend to be, do you really want them to have ultimate authority for your children's education?",

Even if there are more genotypical variance within a race, in no way does that mean the differences between races do not exist. Sure, the formation of races mostly had to do with groups being geographically inaccessible to each other; and with the advent of modern transportation and widespread racial miscegenation, perhaps in a hundred generations, the term will become meaningless.

That's the american concept of race in humans and people don't mean ethnicity or anything else when they say it.

Cory was the one whose video got age restricted, while other white content creators did not get this. Cory send them an email, nothing happened. Then, when Markiplier and Jackscepticey and others made a deal about it to YouTube, protesting on behalf of Cory, instead of penalising them the same way, took away the age restriction... which pretty much implies that Cory is not considered to set the standard.\n\nYouTube as a business is fucked up and unethical!

Standard-issue protective equipment that would be issued to law enforcement probably isn’t very effective against something significantly stronger than your everyday cyanide poisoning.

        "text": "A woman is an adult female human. Prior to adulthood, a female human is referred to as a girl (a female child or adolescent). Denoting the sex that can bear offspring or produce eggs, distinguished biologically by the production of gametes (ova) which can be fertilized by male gametes. Women inherit a pair of X chromosomes from their parents, and are capable of pregnancy and giving birth from puberty until menopause. More generally, sex differentiation of the female fetus is governed by the lack of a present, or functioning, SRY-gene on either one of the respective sex chromosomes. Female anatomy is distinguished from male anatomy by the female reproductive system, which includes the ovaries, fallopian tubes, uterus, vagina, and vulva. The adult female pelvis is wider, the hips broader, and the breasts larger than that of adult males. Women have significantly less facial and other body hair, have a higher body fat composition, and are on average shorter and less muscular than men.\n\nA man is an adult male human.\nPrior to adulthood, a male human is referred to as a boy (a male child or adolescent). \nLike most other male mammals, a man's genome inherits an X chromosome from the mother and a Y chromosome from the father. Sex differentiation of the male fetus is governed by the SRY gene on the Y chromosome. During puberty, hormones which stimulate androgen production result in the development of secondary sexual characteristics, thus exhibiting greater differences between the sexes. These include greater muscle mass, the growth of facial hair and a lower body fat composition.",

When she was younger than 18, at least, since I met her when she was 20 anyway. I know that sort of sounds like a joke but it wasn't. It creates some bad health issues back wise and cancer risks and is just, you know, generally awful. THese things happen for real reasons, which is why their attempts to ban it entirely end up with a lot of health-based collateral, even if you somehow invalidate trans people who get it later in life, obviously.\n\nThey just do not understand that that is not how it works and that these are legitimate surgeries. That's my main issue. They make these things sound like they are SOLELY for lgbt people and so any doctor who deals with it is suddenly a pariah, when they also do plenty of work for cis folks. \n\nIt's so obnoxious. They do not care to read books.",

And you're in here trying to pretend just this current scandal matters, that it's overblown and will disappear. You're pure garbage. \n\nOn a positive note, I know the man who beat John Geoghen (one of the most infamous CSA priests in Boston, who managed to abuse hundreds and hundreds of kids with the church's virtual consent) to death instantly became a folk hero to many. His commissary wallet exploded from donations from instant fans, to the point where he was one of the wealthiest prisoners in every jail he ended up in after. I know folks who still celebrate that event, and still donate to Druce every year on its anniversary.",

You're going to ignore the massive Southern Baptist and Mormon child abuse scandals that have been exploding and making the rounds for months already? Hell, just stop by reddit's pastor arrested sub any day (literally any day) and see how often it gets updated with reports of pastors being caught sexually abusing or grooming children. It's updated with new pastors multiple times a day, every day.  And considering how many are getting caught, the sheer number of people still doing it that haven't been caught yet must be staggering. \n\nAs soon as you let someone have power or authority over your life, you will always and almost immediately find people working hard to take advantage of that trust and power. Just because the Catholics were forced to be more open about it earlier than many, doesn't mean it was ever limited to Catholics. The dynamics and predatory behavior are *always* the same, regardless of specific flavors.",

Trans people aren't the problem, gender essentialism is, alongside people's refusal to accept what they don't understand.

Treating anyone like human beings requires first and foremost to reject completely and condemn unequivocally the trans ideology. \n\nIt is a crime against humanity and a recipe for genocide. It induces people with mental issues to mutilate their genitals and brainwashes children into doing the same. It encourages doctors to induce delusions through drugs and teachers to promote this religion in classrooms to unassuming children. And even worse, efforts are on going to criminalize those that expose this lie and tell the truth.\n\nIt is the worst ideology to face the earth since Nazism and the greatest ongoing crime against humanity.",

The vast vast vast majority of intersex people (born in between male and female) identify as either male or female, and not in between. Their bodies are not male or female, but their identities as men or women exist completely. Most intersex people are not non-binary, though a sizeable minority (around 12-20%) do identify as non-binary. \n\nAlso, how is being trans not real? It’s been objectively observed and has existed in medical literature for over 100 years, and gender incongruities have been recorded in every culture and every era since the dawn of human civilization. So it has to exist, by definition. It’s been observed. \nAnd what is “trans ideology”? Is that an ideology that any trans person adheres to? There are transgender trump supporters. Does that make conservatism a “trans ideology”? There are trans people who share your beliefs. Does that mean you adhere to a “trans ideology”?",

It has no basis in science and has nothing to do with reality.The truth is that manhood or womanhood cannot be separated from the body that a person is born with. An intersex person is a reminder that nature makes mistakes. They are not people of a different gender but a genetic anomaly. People are born with impairments all the time. Some people are born with sight only in one eye. Does that mean they have a different type of sight? Some people are born with hearing impairments, does it mean that they have a different type of hearing? It is called the exception that proves the rule. Some people have the misfortune of being born disabled. They may try to live close to a normal person as possible with the aid of technology.\n\nThe trans ideology is not about that. It is about a person with a healthy body but an unhealthy mental condition, possible an induced mental condition by a doctor who sees the person as their ticket to a golden retirement. Convince an emotionally vulnerable and impressionable person, preferably a child that their body and mind are in misalignment, then break the healthy body and charge them for it, or charge the government for it. This is the most evil con in the history of mankind.  The hundred year old history turns to be dubious on closer examination. It is an attempt to legitimize this crime against humanity by reading these categories into history.",

        "text": "A woman is an adult female human. Prior to adulthood, a female human is referred to as a girl (a female child or adolescent). Denoting the sex that can bear offspring or produce eggs, distinguished biologically by the production of gametes (ova) which can be fertilized by male gametes. Women inherit a pair of X chromosomes from their parents, and are capable of pregnancy and giving birth from puberty until menopause. More generally, sex differentiation of the female fetus is governed by the lack of a present, or functioning, SRY-gene on either one of the respective sex chromosomes. Female anatomy is distinguished from male anatomy by the female reproductive system, which includes the ovaries, fallopian tubes, uterus, vagina, and vulva. The adult female pelvis is wider, the hips broader, and the breasts larger than that of adult males. Women have significantly less facial and other body hair, have a higher body fat composition, and are on average shorter and less muscular than men.\n\nA man is an adult male human.\nPrior to adulthood, a male human is referred to as a boy (a male child or adolescent). \nLike most other male mammals, a man's genome inherits an X chromosome from the mother and a Y chromosome from the father. Sex differentiation of the male fetus is governed by the SRY gene on the Y chromosome. During puberty, hormones which stimulate androgen production result in the development of secondary sexual characteristics, thus exhibiting greater differences between the sexes. These include greater muscle mass, the growth of facial hair and a lower body fat composition.",

        "text": "@CellaDragon I've sat on this for a couple days, wondering how to describe what happens. It can be kind of complicated, and if you've never been around someone who argues a lot, but in a variety of ways using a variety of methods, it might not make a lot of sense. \n\nI call them out every time. How I do it varies by what context they're saying something in (someone I work with vs someone I passively know in a casual setting vs total stranger while shopping, which has happened), what exactly they said, who they were targeting, what their claim is, etc. But I still call them out every time. \n\nBut it helps that I enjoy arguing (it's almost like being on an adult debate team, but with actual stakes), I can think on my feet well, I can be well spoken if the situation is better served that way, and I'm not afraid of a fight, so intimidation doesn't work. But it's not always explicitly confrontational; it can be very fluid and dynamic, more soft exposure than anything, it can be a series of common sense analogies, a simple reminder that someone simply existing isn't exactly a bright or healthy thing to be upset by, or it can turn to yelling and mocking on a dime. \n\nIt mostly feels like a responsibility. I look like an asshole, so I've learned to use that when people decide to kick down at the marginalized. It's not fair that my opinion matters more to some people than those of someone from a marginalized group, but that's reality so I try to use it to my advantage. And I call them out *every* time, because the groups these people target aren't large enough to fight back on their own (part of what makes them convenient targets in the first place), and they damn well shouldn't need to be defending their own existence to total strangers 24/7/365. Just the very idea is disgusting to me.\n\nI've changed some minds, and also gotten some people to *never* discuss anything remotely political around me again. Which both count as wins in my book.",

Utah was one of the first states to pass the Kratom  Consumer Protection Act, and authorize the creation of a committee to assess the potential legalization and use of psychedelics for medical purposes and make recommendations to the legislature, both of which go against the hard anti-drug stance of the right. mike lee, who is generally a massive piece of shit (and one of the most right-wing senators) has teamed up with bernie sanders numerous times to create bipartisan legislation to end our support of war in Yemen, limit the power the president has over war and the sale of arms, require the senate to vote on military actions in Iran, etc\n\npolitics here are fucking weird to say the least…definitely feels like one of the better red states to be a trans person in at least, which I’m really grateful for (for now).",

Now that the dems/left are moving back towards normalcy, you are seeing the majority of Americans reject the radical republicans.",

Facists and Communists in the streets creating violence and instability, leaving the average Joe to pick between what they viewed as the lesser of two evils. \n\nAre  you under the impression that no left wing movement has ever been taken too far to the extreme, resulting in terrible consequences?  That is just a narrative used to promote extremism.  Its like the trend of right wingers who twist facts to say the Nazis were socialists.  The deeper implication is that if Nazis weren't right wing, there is nothing on the extreme right that should prevent people from just going more and more to that extreme.  You can't lose sight of the fact that every ideology is capable of evil, which is proven by history.\n\n\"People talk about the middle of the road as though it were unacceptable. Actually, all human problems, excepting morals, come into the gray areas. Things are not all black and white. There have to be compromises. The middle of the road is all of the usable surface. The extremes, right and left, are in the gutters.\"\n-Dwight D. Eisenhower",

Don't take this as me blaming the Communists, because like I said it's layered and complicated.  It's just to point out that your narrative of the right starting everything, and the left was only defending itself is a dishonest oversimplification.\n\nWeimar Germany aside, how can you say that it's not possible for left wing movements to be taken too far to the extreme?

Heteronormativity is baked into society, so if anything, society tries to force everyone to be straight and cis. The regret rate for gender affirming procedures is less than 0.5%, which is smaller than for the vast majority of medical procedures. Among those who detransition, more than 82% have said it's due to family pressure, losing access to medical care, or facing violence and discrimination, which means you have no business using them as political pawns.

They detransition until a later point in their life when they can transition with more support and confidence.   However, there are people who detransition and stay de-transitioned, and these people deserve our support and gender affirming care just s much as everyone else.  Criminalizing trans-ness does not help people who eventually detransition, it only alienates and harms them.\n\nI will also point out that transitioning does not mean surgery, and never did.  Thus detransitioning also does not mean surgery.  It's possible that some might be involved, but it's pretty rare, as our gender affirming care is designed with altogether too many hoops to jump for people to go down this path due to being fooled or peer pressured as the hate brigade claims.",

I.e. trans women's brains more closely resemble female brains than male brains, and vice versa\n\nI may be misinterpreting your comment, but it comes across as very strangely 'centrist', in that you'rr targetting both sides as if the trans-affirming one... doesn't accept that these studies exist??

I'm saying it MUST be permanent and physiological in some way or else your position falls apart.  The republican argument of \"well i wanted to be a power ranger when i was that age\" becomes true because purely social things can be reversed through simple therapy and exposure. \n\nThe big studies were one study showing the hypothalmus in transwomen shows activity comparable to ciswomen in the presence of male pheromones.  However it's worth noting gay men also have the same variations, and the study didn't account for if they were on estrogen or not. Another study detected grey-matter volume variations in the angular gyrus, the insula,  the insular cortex, and the putamen.  These brain regions are hypothesized to be relevant in transgender people because they are related to the neural network of body perception (not gender).\n\nStudies that have attempted to recreate these finds have turned up with conflicting results. Few autopsy studies have confirmed some of the conclusions.\n\nRight now the science is indecisive, and there is debate about the etiology of gender dysphoria. You have to go with the theory presented earlier to make sense of your positions.",

Your post makes it plain that you do not bear ill will for trans and gay people, and that you mean your words to provide a measure of comfort, and perhaps a scrap of consolation that at least something good will come of their pain. Brace your self, friend, because as I mean to be blunt:\n\nCheck your fucking privilege.  Do you even know what the privilege is that you hold? I don't think you do, which is honestly to your credit, as if you did, then your post would border upon victim blaming. And I don't think that's you.  In this case, your privilege is the luxury of viewing this from a perspective of survivorship bias, because that whole cliche about how 'what doesn't kill you makes you stronger', is a big streaming pile of bullshit.\n\n\nWhat doesn't kill you leaves trauma, scars, irrational fears, economic disadvantage, wasted time in critical early periods of your life.\n\n\nLook, I am really really glad things turned out for you, and I have some idea of how real your struggle was, and you deserve to be proud of your success.  But had none of those obstacles been thrown at you, you would be much STRONGER now, because all of that beat you down, and stole your potential, and you're one of the few who can say they 'won'.  You didn't win, though.   You just lost less, evaded some damage.  Had you grown up middle or upper class, neurotypical, and white, you might easily be a senator, or a billionaire.   A little adversity is healthy, but we are not discussing issues that constitute 'a little adversity'.   If somehow republicans were trying to pull this shit on cis-het kids we would be rounding them up and trying them in courts, it constitutes egregious violations of their human rights, the kind that sent nazis to the gallows, the difference is (so far) merely one of degree, and the power to stuff them into ovens. The underlying ethical framework and constructed morality of these guys is essentially that of the people who conceived of and constructed the 'final solution'.  This does not HAVE a bright side. This is NOT a learning opportunity.  Reassuring platitudes implying that 'getting through this' will make these victims 'stronger', when in fact most will be broken by it, and none will be stronger than they would have been if we as society never allowed them to be so viciously abused.\n\n\n\nI hope you will read this, and take it to heart, as I said above, I believe your heart is very much in the right place here, but this is a belief that needs to die.",

This is the whole basis for why HRT is given as treatment for GD instead of purely therapy, because researchers and psychiatrists treat symptoms as if they are emergent from properties in the brain rather than socially emergent.\n\n\"but that doesn’t debunk the idea that gender is socially constructed.\" \nI'm not debunking this necessarily. There is so little research in gender dysphoria that this might actually turn out to be entirely true in the coming years. My problem is rather that you are holding two contradictory beliefs at the same time. 1. The idea that your gender is socially conditioned into you, and 2. the idea that people cannot unlearn being trans. You cannot believe these two things at once. Either both are true or both are false.\n\nIf gender is truly socially contagious, then this current treatment plan would be incorrect and the republicans would be right. For any other deadly mental illness it would be unacceptable. Like imagine treating an anorexic person by modifying their bodies to be thinner and smaller.",

        "text": "@amazin7006 You know, the money analogy worked perfectly for what I wanted to use it for, but I’ll just drop it since you’re running it into places I didn’t mean to take it. The point is social constructs can have meaning and rules.\n\n“My problem is that you are holding two contradictory beliefs at the same time. 1. The idea that your gender is socially conditioned into you, and 2. the idea that people cannot unlearn being trans.”\nI was going to say I accept 1 and reject 2, but now that I think about it, these two things don’t contradict each other. If someone’s gender is socially conditioned into them, then that doesn’t necessarily mean that they can unlearn that behavior. At most, it means they could’ve just never learned that behavior in the first place. Like, growing up, we’re shown images of the sun as being this yellow ball with spikes coming out of it. Later in life, we know that’s not actually what the sun looks like, but that doesn’t mean we can just get rid of that conception of the sun.\nBut I will still say I accept 1 and reject 2 because there’s no getting around the fact that our conception of gender is obviously shaped around social concepts, hell, you yourself haven’t even posed an alternative. But the reason I reject 2 is not that we can just go in to someone’s brain and miraculously change their entire perception of gender, it’s that we could imagine a world in which some ideas surrounding genders are flipped or completely erased, which would lead to some people who would otherwise be trans, not feeling that initial dysphoria that would otherwise lead to them being trans. I don’t think this is even that unpopular of an opinion, I remember Contrapoints saying something pretty similar in one of her videos. There’s no “trans soul” or some shit, it’s just a figure of speech trans people like to use to express who they fundamentally are.\n\nBut also, saying this doesn’t prove conservatives right about anything because I think that we should construct policy under a utilitarian framework, so I think any treatment’s on the table as long as it helps people.\n\nAs for your comments regarding treatment for biological disorders, a “chemical imbalance” theory has not been proven for depression, and yet we still assign antidepressants to people. You could maybe say that treatment’s to a completely different degree and problem than anorexia, but I feel like we’re just arguing about where to draw the line, at that point.\n\nIn summary, all I want are two things from you. 1. Prove to me that trans-affirming procedures do more harm than good, and 2. Prove to me that gender comes solely from people’s brains. I’m not asking for proof that some people’s brains behave one way, and other people’s brains behave another, I’m asking for proof that outside of any form of interaction with society or social situations, something lights up in some person’s brain that basically says “I’m a man, so I should do manly things”. That’s the only way you can prove gender is biologically rooted.",

Salt Lake is by no means a liberal place, but it's much more accepting than the rest of the state. It makes me sad to see my home broken up and helmed by people more hateful than I can bear. It only makes it feel worse when there are people like Cox, or Romney, are our only \"compassionate\" officials. If their passive nature can be described as such.

Ensure Utah and Davis Counties return a Dem or two along with their dozens of Republicans and that Salt Lake County actually returns a majority of Democrats in line with how their voters vote. First-past-the-post voting fundamentally does not yield democratic results and letting the pols have any say at all into what their own districts look like lets them chose the voters instead of the voters choosing them. Prop 4 was a nice attempt, but I knew even as I voted for it that it wouldn't be enough to keep the Republicans from gerrymandering themselves into perpetual supermajorities.",

Why are women afraid of men, if there is no difference between men and women? At some point there will be a lot of trans people in sports. Not sure highschool matters but acting like this couldn’t be an issue is naive. It seems like a lot of people who never played sports have this idea in their heads that women are even able to compete with men. \nI remember my soccer team at the bottom of our league played a game against the women’s varsity team on its way to win the nationals , and we beat them 8-1 with our goalie scoring one time. Just absolutely insane. That’s what these people are thinking about. There is no men’s sports professionally. Women sports were made because women couldn’t professionally compete with men.

Also, the DNC runs algorithms for certain areas so they know where ti send mail in ballots. Something the RNC are too old and dumb to do. To add, the DNC disenfranchised voters, without a peep by the public of course, by ignoring the wants of republicans voters who donated to candidates and the DNC donated to candidates they felt were more radical so they would win republicans primaries. This worked as every candidate that won due to DNC contributions, lost in the primary. Then you had Republicans stupidly morality grandstand about abortion giving the Democrats a talking point. \n\nLeftist nonsense and defunct extremist slacktivism about trans, whatever, had absolutely no impact on these elections.

It is not hard to do.  That doesn't mean these concepts are illegitimate, or even that they are irrational.  \n\nIn the same way, Walsh's movie doesn't actually say _anything_ about the legitimacy of trans identity, much less legal human rights for trans youth.

Women inherit a pair of X chromosomes from their parents, and are capable of pregnancy and giving birth from puberty until menopause. More generally, sex differentiation of the female fetus is governed by the lack of a present, or functioning, SRY-gene on either one of the respective sex chromosomes. Female anatomy is distinguished from male anatomy by the female reproductive system, which includes the ovaries, fallopian tubes, uterus, vagina, and vulva. The adult female pelvis is wider, the hips broader, and the breasts larger than that of adult males. Women have significantly less facial and other body hair, have a higher body fat composition, and are on average shorter and less muscular than men.\n\nA man is an adult male human.\nPrior to adulthood, a male human is referred to as a boy (a male child or adolescent). \nLike most other male mammals, a man's genome inherits an X chromosome from the mother and a Y chromosome from the father. Sex differentiation of the male fetus is governed by the SRY gene on the Y chromosome. During puberty, hormones which stimulate androgen production result in the development of secondary sexual characteristics, thus exhibiting greater differences between the sexes. These include greater muscle mass, the growth of facial hair and a lower body fat composition.",

If you can't accurately summarize the other side of an argument, then you don't understand what they're saying.  And if you don't understand it, you're not actually answering it, much less refuting it.\n\nI remember reading a survey that was part of a psychological study on political beliefs.  One of the things this survey found was that American conservatives stood out in an unusual way: they viewed their own political beliefs as being factual.  Everywhere else in the first world, and all along the gamut of the political spectrum, people tended to see their political and social beliefs as differences of opinion and perspective.  US conservatives distinguished themselves here.  They routinely confused their political beliefs to be statements of fact.  Whether it was on abortion, LGBTQ, gun control, small government, or evolution, to them, their views were incontrovertible facts, readily verified as objective truth for anyone who cared to look.\n\n I'm often reminded of that when I see people posting dictionary definitions, as another poster just did, perhaps thinking they are saying something we don't already know.  Repeating a dictionary definition in this context amounts to failing to penetrate the surface level of this issue.  You're just bouncing off the surface.",

        "text": "@carllewis9771 there's a difference between the true rate of incidence and the rate of diagnosis.  Cultural stigma depresses the rate of diagnosis, not because they are fewer trans people in fact, but because they aren't going to the doctor/therapist.  You can see this effect comparing country by country: the Netherlands and Denmark have a diagnosis rate that's basically right on the estimated true number, while the state of Iran infamously announced they have zero trans women (and zero gay people, for that matter).  Stigma effects reporting rates.\n\nThe net number of teens getting services or treatment for being trans remains really small.  Japan had 2 firearm homicides one year, and 6 another year.  No one was melting down over how the number tripled.\n\nI believe you do have a growing number of kids who transitioned when they shouldn't have.  In the past, this was exceptionally rare, but today, it's become less rare, and you have this population of young woman who transitioned to live as men, only to find they weren't trans men.  I think there's something going on there, and we should take it seriously.   In an ideal system, this wouldn't happen.  But this is it's own issue, IMO.\n\n Matt Walsh wants to know what a woman is, The Second Sex explores the question and has excellent observations.  De Beauvior makes arguments in that book that are tame today but were radical at the time (ie, women should be be allowed to pursue happiness outside of the house or their obligations to their husband).  It's good reading.\n\nIf you want something more practical, maybe Fausto Sterling's book \"Sexing the Body\" would be helpful.  One of the core ideas of that book is that our categories of sex, defined by chromosomes and egg cells and the like, are constantly being defied by nature.   As a biologist, she points out all these examples where biology does not fit with our mental model (for example, if a women is born without egg cells, we would still think of her as a full woman, or even fully female).  \n\nThere are deep questions about how much these biological categories are clinical desciptions of nature, and how much they are figments of the human mind.",

How are these two things connected?  The answer to that question is not going to he found in a dictionary or a biology reference text.  And it's certainly not found in Walsh's movie.\n\nBiology matters, but social roles matter too.  And social roles are products of the human mind.\n\nTake the example of \"parent.\"  A parent, in biology, has a strict definition.  You can check paternity using genetics.  Animals have parents, planrs have parents, and amoebas have parents.\n\nSo, are parents who adopt their children \"real\" parents?  They plainly don't fit the definition of biological parents.  Does that mean they are being delusional and unreasonable, if they expect me to call them parents?\n\nNo, obviously not.  That's because being a parent is also about what you do.  There is a social and psychological definition, in addition to the biological definition.  We can make a distinction between biological parents and adopted parents, but I don't think there's any good reason to say that adoptive parents are not parents.\n\nI think gender can work the same way.  Yes, we have a biological meaning for sex.  But we also have a social and psychological meanings.  Sometimes they match up, and sometimes they don't.",

Bone weakness and emotional imbalances are but two of the issues the article raises in regards to puberty blockers. \nIn addition, it’s a small issue, but transwomen on high school sports teams who don’t take female hormones still retain their biological advantage over biological women. \nEven after hormones, bone structure and lung capacity isn’t altered. \nThere are real issues here that people on the left knee jerk react to as “alt-right propaganda” when it is not. \nIt’s obvious the right is using trans issues to get votes, but it’s only because they see the lack of cohesion in liberal ideology and wish to exploit that disconnect. I’ve seen people say trans women are women- why can’t we say trans women identify as women? Trans people only realize they are trans after discovering their body doesn’t match what they perceive themselves as. Their reality exists only through acknowledging that they are trans. Thus trans women are not women(a term we still largely reserve for biological women), they are transwomen.",

        "text": "@dansstreet Everything you said is scientifically inaccurate. When puberty blockers are stopped, puberty resumes as normal, and all the side effects you're fearmongering about go away as well. Yet you argue against puberty blockers while at the same time complaining about trans women who are unable to take them. You then lie about the effects of HRT, which studies have already shown alter the muscle mass to that of cisgender women within 1-2 years, and alter the bone density within 4-5 years. The advantage trans women have in sports is statistically negligible. Trans people have been allowed to compete at the Olympic level since 2004 and have not swept the gold medals. It's only when they manage to win something at a local level that transphobes take notice and pretend to care.\n\nMisogynistic right wingers have always disparaged women's sports and never cared about women's sports. The only reason they're white knighting right now is because they hate trans people more than they hate women. The kinds of policies you support would actually force trans men to compete in the women's league, since \"biological sex\" is the only thing that matters to you, where the trans men do in fact have an unfair advantage.\n\nIf you do not understand the difference between sex and gender, then you are ill equipped to be having this conversation. Gender is a social and cultural role. You do not know the biology or medical history of everyone you meet. You don't know people's chromosomes, and I hope you aren't pulling down people's pants before deciding how to address them. The World Health Organization recognizes a distinction between sex and gender, and had you bothered to look that up, you could have saved yourself a lot of embarrassment.",

'Emotional imbalances'   are not something that exceeds the deleterious effects of trans kids going through the wrong puberty with brains not fully set up for the 'natural'  hormones they'd be getting,   quite the contrary.\n\nAnd if you're worried about bone density,  then you should want a better health care system,  not claiming that trans girls are both to be stigmatized whether they develop more baseline male density or not.",

It sure sounds like your intent is to use the distinction to other trans women and make them lesser. Do you make the same value judgements about cis women that can’t have kids? Should such women be told they should only identify as women since some man says a key part of being a woman is making babies? Would you deny women that are also intersex in the same way? An XY karyotype cisgender woman might never even have it come up that they are intersex.\n\nYes, trans women do identify as women, and you can say that, but if you don’t also say cis women identify as women with the same intent, you are using “identify” as a way to say “they just think they are women when they aren’t”.",

        "text": "@dansstreet the NYT article was full of disinformation. I was on a puberty blocker 15 years ago for adrenal hyperplasia. They’ve been prescribed to kids with endocrine disorders since the 80s without any controversy. There is ZERO evidence that they affect personality in any way whatsoever (something like that is usually immeasurable anyway unless it affects cognition, which puberty blockers definitely do not), and the chance for lower bone density than average is so rare that there is clinical doubt whether the reported cases are even the result of puberty blockers at all. In any case, patients are warned of this potential side effect before being prescribed. So it’s a non-issue.\n\nThe issue of trans women in sport is also a non issue, since essentially all sporting bodies prohibit trans women who have not undergone at least 2-5 years of HRT to compete. Certainly all professional sporting bodies have this rule, and many even prohibit trans women (and cis women as well) who have experienced any part of male puberty from competing, which means the only trans girls competing in those sports have no androgenic advantage whatsoever.\n\nIt’s not a “knee jerk” reaction for leftists to say that this is alt-right propaganda and disinformation. It straight up is alt right propaganda and disinformation. As someone who is not trans but was on a hormone blocker for adrenal hyperplasia, the recent hysteria about them is particularly upsetting to me. Where was your outrage about them the last 40 years? Why now do you find them controversial? Let’s not hide behind false concern here. You just don’t like trans people, and you think trans people are fake. The reference to transgender women as “transwomen” is a particularly telling dog whistle, as there is no such word or concept as “transwoman”. Trans/transgender is an adjective, not a noun, and woman/women is a noun. There are trans women and there are cis women, just as there are tall women and short women, but there is no such thing as a “transwoman” just as there is no such thing as a “shortwoman”.\n\nTrans women are women in the same way that short women are women. Trans women don’t merely “identify” as women, they simply are women. Trans is merely an adjective. Please do not invent fake words and assign them to demographics you dislike.",

They're legally adults, so they should be allowed to do with their body as they choose. If a kid even wants to dress as the opposite sex, I'm fine with that too. Dressing in different clothes isn't going to physically mess them up. But when it comes to medically transitioning kids, that's where I, and I think many others, draw the line. I have heard the argument many times that denying kids gender affirming care can be dangerous, that they might kill themselves before they get to 18, and I definitely understand that concern, but surely there is a way that trans kids can have their suicidal thoughts lessened without resorting to physical transitioning right? I feel like these avenues haven't even been looked into because to some people doing so means they are removing a part of their identity, akin to gay conversion therapy. Personally, it has confused me that trans is lumped in with LGB because to my knowledge, being lesbian, gay, or bisexual does not entail wanting to mutilate yourself to alter your physical form, but being trans often can. Gay conversion thereapy doesn't help the recipient because they most likely weren't going to mutilate themselves anyways. But if there is some sort of \"trans conversion therapy\" if you even wanna call it that, that exists out there, that has little to no side affects and stops the gender dysphoria, so that they don't want to hurt themselves for feeling like being in the wrong body anymore, then in my view that is objectively a net positive. I fear that this line of thinking that trans people shouldn't try to get rid of the gender dysphoria through other means aside from physical transition could percolate into other areas of mental health and send us backwards. For example, could we get to a point where psychopaths and sociopaths should not try to be treated with medication because that is repressing their true identity?\n\nOf course everyone deserves rights, whether they are classified as having a mental illness or not. I'm not even advocating for legislation to stop people from transitioning if they want to. People should be allowed to make their own choices. But my point is instead of going full speed ahead on this front, maybe we should slow down a tad and think about what we are doing before we continue.",

Usually minors undergo social transition (changing their hair, clothing, how people refer to them etc) before puberty, and might get puberty blockers to delay puberty until it's safe to get them hormones that match with their internal gender. That might turn out to be appropriate before they turn 18 depending on the person. \nThat actually has a really high success rate in reducing and preventing suicide attempts as well as benefiting their mental and overall health.\nDoes that help?",

Which one are you referring to ?\n\nBecause those i know actually followed the DSM, which included distress and demand to be the other sex.\n\nIf you think that counting those who do not respond anymore as desisting, then you will for one also have to aknowledge that the  1% regret rate is completely false, as it counts those who stopped showing up as not experiencing any regret.\n\nSecond, the idea that \"well they included proto gay just because they were wearing dresses, not real trans people \" doesn't stand either, since the pro transition group do include these kinds of kids for their treatments regularly.\n\nI mean, the famous trans Jazz jenning was started on the transition path at age 3 for example, iirc.",

Do you? when you see a woman who is presenting very womanly do you just go. \"Ah she has the milk producing glands on her chest so she most likely is able to give birth.\"?\n\n\"Well, it sounds like another fallacy i'm often seeing. \r\nIn that sense, are you also going to say we dont base the category of human by whether they have functiunning organs ?\"\n\nNo, you're obfuscating and deflecting. What I'm saying is not a fallacy because. We can generalize the typical traits that we associate with man or woman as genders.\nBut we as a society do not broadly engage with the definition in a way that someone literally stops being a woman if their uterus does not work or their breast are destroyed or even MEDICALLY if they might have an odd chromosome match.\nNow if YOU do this, that's your own personal preference, and I can't really change this but medically.\nWe do not reduce the category of women down to being able to give birth or not.\n\nA sterile woman, is still a WOMAN. Her sterility is simply a secondary feature that can be used as a descriptor because she's still a WOMAN. Because again, we do not 100% base the category of man or woman on biology.\n\n\"You need to have a baseline so you can then be able to tell when something is unusual or wrong. Otherwise, how can you tell that someone missing body parts, and covered in blood, is wounded and in need of help, if you dont reccognize the baseline human as having x feature ?\"\n\nThis isn't about baselines, this is about whether definition can fit different categories of people. If your definition of gender is that it's sex which is chromosomes and genitalia all of the time. Then you innately are ignoring a chunk of people who are effectively cis or \"biological\" women who mismatch this definition.\nSo medically this definition wouldn't work because it's once again inconsistent.\n\n\"Please specify, this is interesting. It's yoour perspective as man that makes you a man ? What do you mean ? And in your example, did  you mean that like, someone performed an extensive surgery to change your body then ? Because then yes, you would still be a man. \"\n\nNot just my perspective, it's both the combination of my internalized perception due to the underlying innateness of how my brain works, along with the outward gender I express as. These two things align making me cis, if I was suddenly given xx chromosomes, I wouldn't be a woman. If I was then given a vagina and uterus, I would still not be a woman.\nBecause I am a man, if you're agender that's fine but for me and a decent amount of men, I think this answer is pretty consistent.\n\nIf someone just started calling me a woman I wouldn't be a woman.\n\nNow if you're talking about sissy hypno shit where my brain is femininized or something then I'm not engaging with that because I'm not into gender bender kink shit.\n\n\"Here is the thing, to many of us who are criticals of the notion of gender being used so widly, the gender affirming care is basicly a new version of lobotomy based on intimidation of critics, and questionable sciences, and bad studies, especially when applied to minors.\"\n\nIt's not, you're just wrong, literally every single study on this done on adults shows that gender affirming care is the BEST treatment for gender dysphoria, if you disagree. You have no scientific grounding to stand on really, this is a fact broadly. \nBut I mean at least you're being more honest now and engaging.\n\nI'd rather talk about this because when it comes to gender/sex philosophy you just seem completely disconnected from actually engaging and just go off on tangents lul.\n\n\"they are more liberated now, obviously, but that doesn't mean medieval women in europe lived like women in today's afghanistan.\"\n\nLike this statement, do you really think woman in the middle ages where women weren't even encouraged to be educated was an okay era to live in? you're nuerotic.\n\n\"I'm afraid that though he is a reactionary and much more right wing than me, the science is actually more on his side on transgender issue, given some of the things the WPATH pushes for, the complete disdain for women spaces that TRA have had, and how european countries are walking back on gender affirming care.\"\n\nNo, he's really not, just link me studies. Link me comparative studies of alternate medical care for gender dysphoria.\nPlease tell me this amazing alternative groundbreaking theory you have that matt walsh has figured out that ONE HUNDRED percent blows the fuck out of gender affirming care in terms of numbers.\nShow me the data I wanna see it, PUHlease show it to me.\n\nBecause at this point if you're just gonna keep deflecting and not engaging with my points I'd rather just study debate this.\n\n\"It's not about just whether i want to use it or not. Activist are trying to enforce this speech everywhere they can . Have you heard of the shitstorm Anakasparian of the young turks received when she asked not to be referred to as a birthing person ?\"\n\nOkay, I don't know if you just keep tabbing over to twitter or you're trolling me. But I literally do not care what moronic progressives on the bird app are saying. Okay? you bringing them up to me means fucking nothing because I don't agree or associate with them.\nThis would be like me bringing up fucking the pedophile defender milo or the other pedo that was with YE or the ACTUAL nazi nick fuentes.\nI'm sure you don't agree with any of their views right?\nSurely?\n\n\"Yes, they did so, because they hated her for leading the french army to a bunch of victory. Now, given that this court was basicly a kangaroo court, and that their judgement was reversed when the french troops took the town...\"\n\nThis is just speculation on your part like idk what you want me to say you're inferring so much from basically no actual basis in reality. Like I said if you THINK this that's fine, but the fact is her wearing mens clothes was IN the text on her heresy charges as a major issue.\nI'm not sure why you're so obsessed with this, I already said if that's your opinion it's fine.\n\n\"ok then, maybe i confused you with another responder, but i thought you said the western conception of gender was like, a recent anomaly.\"\n\nYou keep using \"western\" are you ok dude? like honestly I'm asking for a friend.",

Obviously outward SEXUAL characteristics do not define gender because a butch dyke is not suddenly a man.\nIf you call her a MAN and she says NO I am a woman she is a woman.\nYou have identified her as a man due to sexual cues, but she herself doesn't identify as a man.\n\nYou instinctively separate chromosomes from outward/internal perceptions.\nThis is what gender is as I've explained you can even intuit this because you've said in cases you're wrong you would fall back on checking chromosomes, which are a sexual characteristic.\n\nThe reason you've never assumed it is exactly because gender and sex are separate. You identify people based on physical characteristics such as clothing, poise, voice. To make a pre-loaded assumption of their gender.\n\n\"for humans, i wouldn't differentiate the two until recently. It is this new way of thinking that makes me try to understand what gender is is and how it's useful.\"\n\nI mean yeah because we learn, study and come to new conclusions over time.

We have something that is extremely effective outside of edges cases, we're talking like 99% or more accuracy, unless the person takes huge steps through make up, surgery etc to alter appearance.\"\n\nIt's not just 'edge cases' right? AGAIN I'm gonna have to hard push you here. It seems like you want to exclude the exception to the rule but the rule you're using applies to a completely separate category.\nIf you acknowledge that the rule doesn't work when we group these two subsets together, being sex and gender.\nThe rule you're trying to use here doesn't really work because you've admitted.\n\nFeminine men = men\nMasculine women = women\n\nSo obviously physical characteristics as a sole metric, doesn't work as a base thesis. Even IF you're checking genitals, as you've stated if they HAVE had surgery they can very convincingly imitate genital differences.\nNow if we go a step further and say \"oh well they're infertile so there.\" it STILL is not a correct base thesis because there are women and men who are either born impotent or unable to give birth.\n\nAnd the crazy thing is, once we've gotten to the point that we're checking all of these other factors, we realize, this has nothing to do with how we socially interact with each other right?\n\nWe don't do this level of heavy checking when it comes to assumptions of what categories we put people in.\nThis is AGAIN what gender is and what sex is not.\n\n\"ok. I have to  ask.

    "text": "Lmao, ah yes, I forgot all about the “Red Wave” that was supposed to be coming last year. Listening back to that clip, followed up by your lovely German accent saying “And what happened?… Republicans got fuckin’ trounced.” Made me genuinely belly laugh. All the anti-trans stuff is just so absurd that it puts off even people who aren’t very supportive of the trans community. There are plenty of working class people who most leftists would view as transphobic, and probably rightly so, because they’re very out of touch with the LGBTQIA+ community, they don’t understand trans issues, they don’t always use the right pronouns, and they think & say all sorts of problematic things, but despite all of that they have no desire whatsoever to see trans people legally oppressed, they see no reason to prevent trans people from transitioning, etc, because they are all too aware that the existence & acceptance of trans people has absolutely zero negative effects on their lives, and while that lack of personal effect on them means they have no desire to come out in strong support of trans people, it also means they have no desire to come out against trans people. At the end of the day, they don’t really care about trans people because they aren’t effected by trans issues, and no matter how hard Republicans try, they cannot force those people to care about those issues, and come out against them. Trans people are an extremely small portion of our society, they always have been, and they always will be, and as a group they are totally harmless. That is a shame insofar as it means there aren’t legions of people from every corner of society coming out in support of them, it also protects them to some extent because it makes it very hard for the right to rile people up against them. I live in hope that, as a result of how poorly this bigoted nonsense plays with the majority of society, it will soon lead to the separation of the coalition of the money people & the evangelical whack jobs that has made up the Republican Party since the late 1970s, and that the Republican Party will take the side of the money people over the evangelicals. Evangelicals are a small minority within our society, and they have entirely too much political power. They are the one group of people who actually need to be disenfranchised because they hold way more power than they should based on the percentage of the population they account for.",

Male, female, intersex. Those terms should have no effect on who you are as a person . . .  only WHAT you are as a person. Because human biology is concrete fact, and nothing else.",

Gender is not useless for self identification because gender is based on your social traits determined by the cultural factors in your environment…If a male is born in a feminine environment then do you think that males is under some kind of delusion or is facing a mental illness if they wanna act and dress like a woman all the time ? Nope ! \n\n3)Oh no…You weren’t too bad until the last part…Gender is an irrational cult even though the majority of scientific community accepts its ? Do you have any arguments for your ridiculous claims ?\n\n4)Bruh…Gender has nothing to do with being male,female or intersex…Gender is a social identity…Why can’t you understand this simple point ?

MW is a raging transfobia and thats a good thing, because transitioning genders causes a lot of problems. And since when is Big M a ped? When he was talking about the 16 thing it was because thats how it traditionally was. If your saying that matty W is a ped for saying that than you must also think that unnescessary life alterimg surgerys thatchange gender should also be not allowed until their an adult too right? And whats all this about disgust towards libs and all that? I dispise liberal ideals, not Liberals. I live in california, but I dont hate everyone here. Heck my cross county team mates are all liberal too, and there some of the coolest people I know. Even my crush has a few tiny liberal ideals tucked beneath an insanely smart figure, and yet she's one of my best friends. I think for myself and have heard both sides, I just happen to agree with what W-Matt has to say more than his liberal counterparts. Wait wait wair, now?

Classification: People are divided into \"them and us\".\n2. Symbolization: When combined with hatred, symbols may be forced upon unwilling members of pariah groups\n3. Discrimination: Law or cultural power excludes groups from full civil rights: segregation or apartheid laws, denial of voting rights\n4. Dehumanization: One group denies the humanity of the other group. Members of it are equated with animals, vermin, insects, or diseases.\n5. Organization: Genocide is always organized... Special army units or militias are often trained and armed.\n6. Polarization: Hate groups broadcast polarizing propaganda.\n7. Preparation: Mass killing is planned. Victims are identified and separated because of their ethnic, religious or gender identity, or sexual orientation.\nWhen you have politicians making secret lists of trans people, you should be very afraid. From here, the next steps are as follows\n8. Persecution: Expropriation, forced displacement, ghettos, concentration camps.\n9. Extermination: It is 'extermination' to the killers because they do not believe their victims to be fully human.\n10. Denial. The perpetrators deny that they committed any crimes.",

And forgetting that we are products of Nature too, is our real problem. Change is the only constant. What we are arguing about preferences, and who gets to set those preferences in society. Your choice to follow \"conservative\" preferences is a subjective choice. You do you. That too is a preference. You prefer not to wear corsets and a bustle too. But that too, was once conservative dressing. But it's not now. But why should ones preferences become social rules? Why should they have the force of laws? These are questions, amongst many others that have plagued all societies, and the answers are not settled ones. They change. Societies evolve, but for some the speed of change, and the consequences of change induce anxiety, or even fear. For others, less so. As civilised people, we should be able to discuss these changes, and decide collectively on our approach, but it gets tough when that debate is hijacked for political gain. And that usually happens in societies, whose politics are adversarial, rather than collaborative, and therefore tend towards conflict and instability. And there are people who cannot resist taking advantage of that. What makes it easy for them is that quite natural range of responses to change, and the complexity of actually being human in an uncertain universe. Its stressful, and people tend to vary in how well they can deal with that. There will always be unknowns, but not everyone can handle that. So we agree on conventions to simplify things, so as not to stress us out. They may not reflect reality completely, but we content ourselves with them because it's easier. That is what culture is. Culture is not objective reality, its an edited map of reality, with omissions, simplifications, and stuff that is just plain wrong, purposively designed to enable specific collective goals. And it is often drawn by those with power and influence. And your freedom to dress as you do, is another convention, that's been replicated over years. But nothing stands still.",

Jews, who overwhelmingly voted for Narutowicz) and in the end, days after taking office, a crazed right-winger painter shot the newly appointed President, which became a step in Poland's descent into authoritarianism later down the line. You can see the similarities, right? Confidence in victory, disappointment, bigoted scapegoating, hysteria -> death and violence.

    "text": "Aylbdr Madison\r\nEveryone needs to know exactly what fascism is..\r\n1. Powerful and Continuing Nationalism - Fascist regimes tend to make constant use of patriotic mottos, slogans, symbols, songs, and other paraphernalia. Flags are seen everywhere, as are flag symbols on clothing and in public displays.\r\n2. Disdain for the Recognition of Human Rights - Because of fear of enemies and the need for security, the people in fascist regimes are persuaded that human rights can be ignored in certain cases because of \"need.\" The people tend to look the other way or even approve of torture, summary executions, assassinations, long incarcerations of prisoners, and the like.\r\n3. Identification of Enemies/Scapegoats as a Unifying Cause - The people are rallied into a unifying patriotic frenzy over the need to eliminate a perceived common threat or foe: racial, ethnic or religious minorities; liberals; communists; socialists, terrorists, and the like.\r\n4. Supremacy of the Military - Even when there are widespread domestic problems, the military is given a disproportionate amount of government funding, and the domestic agenda i s neglected. Soldiers and military service are glamorized.\r\n5. Rampant Sexism - The governments of fascist nations tend to be almost exclusively male-dominated. Under fascist regimes, traditional gender roles are made more rigid. Opposition to abortion is high, as is homophobia and anti-gay legislation and national policy.\r\n6. Controlled Mass Media - Sometimes the media are directly controlled by the government, but in other cases, the media are indirectly controlled by government regulation, or sympathetic media spokespeople and executives. Censorship, especially in war time, is very common.\r\n7. Obsession with National Security - Fear is used as a motivational tool by the government over the masses.\r\n8. Religion and Government are Intertwined - Governments in fascist nations tend to use the most common religion in the nation as a tool to manipulate public opinion. Religious rhetoric and terminology is common from government leaders, even when the major tenets of the religion are diametrically opposed to the government's policies or actions.\r\n9. Corporate Power is Protected - The industrial and business aristocracy of a fascist nation often are the ones who put the government leaders into power, creating a mutually beneficial business/government relationship and power elite.\r\n10. Labor Power is Suppressed - Because the organizing power of labor is the only real threat to a fascist government, labor unions are either eliminated entirely, or are severely suppressed .\r\n11. Disdain for Intellectuals and the Arts - Fascist nations tend to promote and tolerate open hostility to higher education and academia. It is not uncommon for professors and other academics to be censored or even arrested. Free expression in the arts is openly attacked and governments often refuse to fund the arts.\r\n12. Obsession with Crime and Punishment - Under fascist regimes, the police are given almost limitless power to enforce laws. The people are often willing to overlook police abuses and even forego civil liberties in the name of patriotism. There is often a national police force with virtually unlimited power in fascist nations.\r\n13. Rampant Cronyism and Corruption - Fascist regimes almost always are governed by groups of friends and associates who appoint each other to government positions and use governmental power and authority to protect their friends from accountability. It is not uncommon in fascist regimes for national resources and even treasures to be appropriated or even outright stolen by  government leaders.\r\n14. Fraudulent Elections - Sometimes elections in fascist nations are a complete sham. Other times elections are manipulated by smear campaigns against or even assassination of opposition candidates, use of legislation to control voting numbers or political district boundaries, and manipulation of the media. Fascist nations also typically use their judiciaries to manipulate or control elections.",
