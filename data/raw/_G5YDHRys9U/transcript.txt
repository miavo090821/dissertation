do you know what's one of the unique characteristics about the modern era of American politics which I haven't seen any political scientist or philosopher speak about before it's the following every single political faction liberals conservatives leftists of various kinds they are all forced to put forth their Politics as if they were somehow a contending for Force for power even if they were the most archetypical example of the dominant ideas and the dominant institutions they can't make that explicit they have to always act as if they don't have power in order to somehow sustain the power that they objectively have even the most so-called Centrist of liberals they'll do this they'll present a scenario where normaly has been hijacked and there's been this great threat to democracy brought about by conservatives and they are the radical forces that are fighting in order to have normaly regained the conservatives do this as well in very uh many different ways for instance a figure like Andrew Tate is constantly talking about this image from the Matrix of the red pill where you uh you're supposed to take the red pill in order to escape the matrix but for instance in the figure of Andrew Tate it becomes comes uh quite explicit that what is the way that you escape the matrix well you get a bunch of friends and you become rich but what is that if not the archetypical ideology of what du boy called the American assumption the idea that through Thrift and hard work you can irrespective of background come to the US and get rich so very interestingly I think what we have in our current political conjuncture that is unprecedented is a condition if I can you know be excused to get a little bit jargony where heon the ruling ideas in order to preserve themselves have to be uh performed have to be put forth as if they are lost as if they have lost their status of being the ruling ideas it is almost as if hemony in order to sustain itself has to constantly present itself as if hegemony has been lost and as if it is fighting a counter hegemonic struggle and this is unprecedented I write in some of my books specifically the perod fetish in the crisis of Western Marxism that the role that the Western left that the Western marxists have played is as a controlled form of counter hegemony so as a group of people and uh an institution a framework of thought that presents itself as radical as challenging the system but that in reality just gets the denting energies of the public of the populace and allows it to be folded into a pro-imperialist fold in a way that's of course promoted by the institutions of the dominant order but that's not only the case anymore it's not just the case that a way of keeping hegemony is having uh forms of controlled counter hegemony that serve today heemy itself has to present itself as counter hegemonic in order to preserve hegemony itself so it's almost as if you have a condition where the best way to get the effect of the Matrix blue pill is to drink the red pill um it's if if if Plato's allegory of the cave that comes from book Seven of his Republic if it was written today it would be more accurate to write it instead said as a form of Labyrinth where once you escaped the first cave you think you have escaped the cave in general but in reality you're in a different more advanced more complex cave that you are unware of the fact it is even a cave in the first place and this reminds me of a skit called Max and Patty Go to Prison from Peter K where this prisoner is beginning to dig a tunnel to escape the prison and his cellmate once he's shown the tunnel he gets flustered and uh he can't understand initially why his cellmate is so flustered and then his cellmate tells him what are you digging a tunnel to to the cell next door and then he notices that the tunnel he's been digging the whole time is not to go outside the prison but to the cell next door in many ways all political factions in our day and age have to present themselves as trying to escape the prison but in reality the vast majority of them intentionally or otherwise are really just digging a pathway to the cell next door now this shouldn't take us to the to the nihilism that you find for instance in postmodern theorists where what you have is the suspension of ones to a purported position of objectively recognizing Universal inment and it ends up being its own form of epistemological Escape that serves entament itself where this condition of the various forms of purportedly dissident politics getting absorbed back into the dominant order is generalized as a a universal phenomenon that every form of resistance uh naturally and necessarily gets reabsorbed into the ruling order that is itself a way of presenting uh a radical hypothesis that it's fully compatible with the existing order I mean there's uh it's it's hard not to see Thatcher's Tina there's no alternative in a perspective like this because quite literally they're saying there's no alternative because all apparent Alternatives just end up collapsing into what is already and up collapsing into the dominant order and that itself plays the role of what KY shukra has called the impossibility the radicalization of the impossibility of exit so I'm not trying to make the point that the postmodernists do which is that all forms of Escape just end up getting reabsorbed into the dominant order I think that is itself an example of that the point I'm trying to make is that while we should reject that nihilistic position we should be realist to the fact that today there has been constructed a whole industry of Escaping The Matrix whose sole purpose and end is entrenching US deeper into the Matrix perhaps in forms that are more profound and complex because we don't even recognize as uh as the Matrix itself so in other words today a good chunk of dissident politics which it's basically all forms of politics because the most jonic of politics presents itself as disident in our time what it what it is actually doing is like that Peter K skit presenting an escape of the prison which is in reality just uh positioning yourself in the cell next door while remaining perfectly entrenched within the prison so don't fall into the complete nihilism of the postmodernist as to the possibilities of real change but also be conscious of the fact and be consistently self-critical and self assessing of what it is that you're doing and analyze in each instance is this a form of dissent that is in reality entrapping my political practice even deeper into the structures that be in a way that for the structures that be itself that form of dissent becomes an integral and necessary component
