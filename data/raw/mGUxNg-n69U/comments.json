Its the Federal governments public money which funds the taxpayer.\nFed govt spends dollars > USD's circulate > people pay taxes/file tax RETURNS. Understanding this is key to understanding that Congress can ALWAYS afford to pay for what is available for sale in the US economy.",

    "text": "Given that only political appeals that can be financed can be brought before the public, there is thus little reason to expect that many important issues of great concern to ordinary voters are likely to find expression in the political system. In money-driven elections and policymaking, you will have candidates, elections, real competition that is not collusion, and all kinds of noise, but when the smoke clears – and there will be lots of handsomely subsidized smoke – average (“median”) voters will not determine where policy settles.\n\n“Not only do ordinary citizens not have uniquely substantial power over policy decisions; they have little or no independent influence on policy at all.”",
