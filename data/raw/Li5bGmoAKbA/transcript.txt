hello midwestern mark's viewership um my name is eddie smith here with carlos carrito and we have a very special guest on today dr asitar buyer economist i believe right and marxist communists just like us um so dr bauer you want to introduce yourself talk a little bit about your background and what you're all about sure uh it's it's fair by the way uh oh i'm so sorry that's all right um yeah i'm a professor of economics i teach at riverside city college in southern california and i have written about prison slavery prison labor in the united states and i study capitalism socialism communism those are my those are my research interests but mostly what i do i mean as a community college teacher mostly what i do is teach right i mean that's that's the like basic level courses introductory courses is that's kind of my jam like as a you know as a community college teacher cool definitely so um one of the things i i notice you didn't mention is your your work on on meditation and that's that's actually what our first question is is related to um we in midwest remarks one of the things we emphasize is uh chess conception of of a new man and and this process of personal development and and and this process of virtue building that's almost an aristotelian uh sort of uh goal that we have um and it's something that we see that's quite missing in the current left but uh one of the things that that we enjoy about you is that you sort of have that similar spirit with with meditation so the first question i wanted to ask you is um why meditation how do you uh connect it to uh to communism um and what do you see the role between the intersection of those two yeah that's a great question um you know it's like because i have two prominent interests it is often times kind of difficult for me to like reconcile them you know and i'm like i never know you know like people who are into what i do with meditation are not necessarily into my politics you know and vice versa i mean there's plenty of you know non-spiritual or atheist you know marxists out there who are like i get the [ __ ] out of here with this [ __ ] you know i mean so you know i mean there's a there's always like that kind of divide and it's it's kind of like i don't know like like the head and the heart or something you know like a lot of us have that kind of um you know division within ourselves you know like the things that we really want to do or you know we tell ourselves not a good idea or you know the things that that we're really passionate about uh you know we hide for for a variety of reasons and you know i mean that um that's a real problem and i think we are we're kind of encouraged to do that you know because it's like what does our culture uplift you know it's like money fame power success stuff like that right like i mean is that really who you are you know i mean i i think that's what that's what the the salience of meditation is you know to to learn well who am i and what do i really want what's what's important to me in the very limited time i have here you know and um and to go through um you know a conscious uh path of development for oneself you know i mean i think marxism socialism communism spends a lot of time talking about the development of society you know and a lot less time talking about the individual which is you know appropriate right i mean that's that's that's the area of inquiry um it is important to develop the individual but it's like in what way right are you developing yourself in contrast to society i mean against the needs of society right i mean that's kind of like how we're encouraged to think about it like get rich [ __ ] everyone else right like i mean that's very problematic uh you know i think we we want something that it that involves more of this sense of social harmony you know but but how do you do that when society is so fractured between you know the very few who who suck up society's surplus and you know use it to become fantastically wealthy versus you know the vast majority who you know let's be honest right most of us have to spend almost you know like a good portion of our waking hours like at work right and does that provide you with the self-development that we all long for you know um so i mean i think what i've just found meditation is that meditation is a very um you know rapid way to to get you know to develop oneself you know and and since we're all sort of pressed for time you know that that's it it's good to have those efficient means of development for sure and i i've really enjoyed using your meditation videos for myself being pressed for time but you know there's those times where you feel yourself getting overwhelmed especially with trying to share um an ideology like marxism in the west where it's been so demonized it's easy to get overwhelmed you gotta center yourself kind of like you said remind yourself who you are and what you're doing this for and there's def you talk about the can disconnect between the head and the heart kind of and i've noticed in the field of economics at least in the west there's definitely that right it's so you know the argument is that socialists haven't studied economics they just don't understand that it fails every time when you know really there's all sorts of i mean you there's economics is just how we interact with nature and how we use human labor so if you're not leading with your heart and wanting to make the work you know the economic system one that makes life better for the masses then i think you're missing a huge part of what the field is supposed to be about yeah yeah i mean it's it's about it's about human well-being i mean i think one of the great contributions of marx is mark says what does capitalism do capitalism uplifts an object you know capital right like and says this is what's truly important you know like i mean um you know that capital has individuality that people don't you know i mean that is like a very anti-human kind of perspective you know like um and that your humanity is tied to like what kinds of assets you own i mean that's an incredibly dangerous idea um yeah i think it's it's kind of reminds me of how like a lot of the accusations towards socialism or communism are really self-indictments of capitalism itself you know like that the idea that that oh well socialism means everyone's going to be the same and nobody's an individual like what's really causing that right i mean you know um i i like how you put that um in my field of philosophy um marxist philosophers have usually been within the realm of the humanist and although i i strongly disagree with their political interpretations of what you might call the real existing socialism although i think the term itself is problematic um one of the things that someone like from does is position marx in in the humanist tradition from i mean all the way from like aristotle and buddha and and from there on jesus even um but people don't understand that that the marxist project starts with the concern for the human individual it's a deeply humanistic um he calls it consistent humanism early on um but uh yeah it's it's it's funny because um i mean we've had in the 20th century different theories uh different theorists jose ortega said most famously revolt of the masses he talks about the death of the individual and now we have a masked man and in in our country we have uh charles wright mills who talks about that extensively in the power elite um so it there's this sort of phenomena of the society that's built on individualism itself destroying the individual and like you said there's a lot of projection going on and and and saying that oh socialism destroys individualities but um you know who are individuals now what we have is really just one blob mass but yeah i think people always find a way to express themselves but it's really like a question of like what are the material conditions that lead to human development that enhance human development i mean like you know having to hustle every waking minute i mean like i i'm not i'm not going to say that that doesn't cause people to be i don't know what like i mean there's probably some benefit to it right but but like does it allow you to develop every part of yourself like i mean i don't think so you know i mean you you know it it's like you focused on i don't know what goals or or or just even i mean a lot of times the hustle is just to get by you know like it's not even to accomplish some great thing it's it's just to sort of have the basics of a you know a decent life you know i mean uh i feel this for myself quite often i mean i'm i'm kind of in a privileged position personally you know and especially relative to like a lot of other you know like people on the left or marxists or whatever or you know young people i mean you know like i mean the struggle to just make it you know is like huge and you know like i mean i do i do well i have a you know salary i haven't i didn't lose my job in response to covet thank god you know i mean like but millions of people have i mean tens of millions of people have you know i mean it's it's it's bad out there and um you know just the insecurity of that you know like maybe you're making it but you don't know if that'll continue i mean how does that you know affect your your anxiety level and you know i mean we i think we all have this because we all know uh there isn't really a net here you know unless you're rich you know that's the net um and i think that a lot of the desire to be rich is really just a kind of basic desire for security you know to like not be constantly having to worry like oh is this you know is that my card gonna get declined or whatever you know like i'm trying to buy groceries and that's a thing i think everyone should be free of you know i i think it's hard you know it's hard to truly develop yourself in a in a um in an atmosphere of that kind of of fear and you know anyone who who makes progress on it has my respect you know for sure that's a really good way of putting it um so we'll transition here to our next question um you have a lot of work on your youtube channel actually analyzing the chinese economy and there's a lot of talk about china now and people kind of view it in this like binary you either think china good or china bad and people want a simplified answer and i did a video recently um responding to professor vijay prashad who was saying this is a non-marxist question to be a dialectical materialist you have to look at china in its totality and your work is i think really useful in doing that because you're digging into the roots of what the chinese economy actually was after the revolution and then um so yeah if you just want to give your opinion on on uh china um maybe the revolution itself but then what it's kind of turned into under deng xiaoping and now she's in pain yeah um that's a good question uh i mean china uh i think china is just becoming more part of everybody's consciousness because of its its rise to power you know and it's um you know i mean i like i started studying economics you know like in college 30 years ago so like during that whole time i mean you know 30 years ago people were saying hey by 2020 china is going to you know like be a world power and you know buy this and this data you know exceed the the united states and stuff like this right so but back then it was far far less discussed you know i mean china was like a sideline you know now that's really changed you know so it's like china's on everyone's kind of mind and and there are just so many opinions and views about it you know i mean left right i just think it's interesting because i think the general discourse is that like anything good and it does the bourgeois discourse right like the general discourse is anything good that happens economically or in terms of human rights is because of capitalism right and anything bad that happens is because of socialism and it's like that is the most idiotic kind of thinking you know like that there that there is like like first of all you know there's this problem called essentialism right i mean like when you when you take a complex social historical formation and you you say oh it has these pure essential qualities that's very problematic i mean you're basically asking to be wrong when you do that right like like you know show me what are the essential qualities of capitalism in its last 300 years of development and i mean you know mainstream economics does this right it says well the essence of capitalism is uh it continuously maximizes wealth and it produces a stable equilibrium right which which does this which is optimal in the sense of uh efficiency and uh utility human happiness but that is like so at odds with anyone who's observed capitalism you're like really so you're telling me it always maximizes wealth really uh honestly what's it been doing has it been doing that in 2020 how about 2021 how about during these power outages in texas would that is what you'd call maximizing human welfare i mean it's absurd right like if you take that essentialist position you're just asking to be wrong so like okay does capitalism has have essential features or does it have a whole variety of manifestations that depend on the history and development of that country right so i mean i think if you pushed anybody who's serious about this stuff then they'd have to say yes okay there's many forms of capitalism so all right well are there many forms then of socialism as well right or is that a pure essence which then can we can you know like attribute these simplified you know cause and effect relationships with so i i feel like that's a lot of where the discourses around china like is it socialist or is it capitalist but always with this essentialism of of both terms um and you know socialism is not a very well defined term anyway right i mean like none of these terms are you know like oh i prefer market socialism i prefer communism i prefer you know capital i prefer social democracy like i mean this is part of the problem with discussing this stuff is that what what people mean by those terms is just often very very different you know like um even among people who are like proponents of it you know i mean if you ask somebody what is the difference between capitalism and social democracy i mean you know like that just you know you don't have to scratch very deep here in order to see like there's a lot of problems so my position on china if i kind of sum it up and you know i do have videos on this right i look at like china's history prior to the revolution i look at the maoist period you know because this is like a unique period of so you know from the revolution 1949 to to mao passing away i i go up to 1978 my mouth passed away in 1976 but i just consider that to be like one period you know um and then dang and the reforms of dang i just you know i mean you could you could do each leader you know but i just sort of said all right i'm gonna just do the post 78 period um you know i i think the the bolsheviks when they when they describe what are we doing here right we had a revolution in a feudal country with an extremely backward uh capitalist core right the most backward in europe probably right what are we doing here well we need to industrialize we need to you know we we marxist had thought that the revolution would occur in the most developed area capitalist nations right the places where the contradictions of capitalism had the most time to you know reach a boiling point that didn't happen um so how do we how do we grapple with that what do we do right i mean and lennon the other bolsheviks right to say well we need we need state capitalism i mean that's that is the term they used i mean it's not i don't think they used it as a pejorative right these days it's used as a pejorative like oh that country's state capitalist you know all the problems so they didn't mean it that way right they're like um it's it's it will avoid the big problem of capitalism which is that you have a small class that gets rich off of the labor of others right we won't do that we'll have the state you know take the surplus but you still have a problem right which is that someone else is taking the surplus not the workers right and you know they they acknowledge that they're like look we cannot advance into the higher stage of communism yet you know i mean we need to develop the country and we need to defend ourselves we need to you know like what's the first thing that happened we had this awful bloody civil war i mean millions of people died this is the third worst conflict of the 20th century a very bloody century you know like you know that's how do we how do we just keep power how do we stay in existence right and china has all of those contradictions as well right i mean they're like any modern nation has the problem how do we defend our interests right how do we especially when there's all of these imperialist powers about who would love nothing more than to you know take away our sovereignty you know either through debt or through direct conquest right i mean like how often has that been demonstrated right so so china starts off in a similar kind of way right they do it pretty much the exact pattern of development as the soviets and because they say there's a lot to be learned from what the soviets are doing right i mean we we are also a largely peasant society right almost everybody in china is in agriculture is in the rural countryside right um and so you know they proceed with similar but a slightly different path of development but focusing on you know like okay the state owns all industry right the state develops that as rapidly as possible so you know i mean is that so if you have capitalism with one employer what is that right i mean that's kind of like the big question of the 20th century you know like so we could call that socialism and i think that's fair right i mean because socialism is not a very well defined term like i said right but if we want to say that's all socialism is i think that's very problematic you know because socialism can take on many forms right like we've already established capitalism can be taken on many forms the same must be true of socialism right so to say that it can only be this i think is that's just a huge mistake you know i mean we're still very early in terms of the grand historical sweep of development of socialism so you know the form that socialism in china is taking uh you know is state capitalists yes they have they have allowed private capitalists to also appropriate the products of labor right these things have contradictions i mean they have a lot of the problems of capitalism but if you want to say that china is capitalist i feel like you have to also acknowledge that it's different from every other form of capitalism that we've ever seen you know so i don't you know i i'm like i'm not i'm not comfortable just being like china is x right because the the problem of essentialism is so big here you know um i'm like i mean look at how long i've tried to address this question already i feel like i've been going on and on you know like because there's not a simple answer to it you know like you need to kind of give a lot of background before you're even in the ballpark you know because it's just so easy you know like whatever i say if i say china's socialist there's going to be you know some on the left and my fellow marxists and whatever are going to be like boo lame you know dr bear sucks how dare you say it's socialistic you know oh they got billionaires they've got a lot of the problems with capital seminars yeah they do you know um but what are they doing with the surplus that they appropriate in the regime of exploitation that they oversee well they are doing you know they're they're consciously moving up the value chain first of all right they're defending themselves from the interests of the imperialist powers i mean the united states has encircled the region with military bases right so we can't say that they're they're free of danger um they've also lifted hundreds of millions of people out of poverty so i i think the and these are things that capitalism does not do right i mean capitalism if it does those things it does it by accident you know like socialism does these things as a matter of you know direct planning and that i think is you know it's been shown right that's that leads to a more rapid increase in living standards in human welfare than if you just say yes well okay [ __ ] the poor and you know if they they like get jobs and and survive then that's great and if not well i don't care right because i'm rich i mean that doesn't you know that doesn't lead to like a good outcome especially for the most vulnerable yeah i think that's that's a fantastic uh answer um that's why i really like the the formula that the chinese are using what they call their their project is socialism with chinese characteristics so um there's this sort of anti-essentialism going on and that has a lot to tell us about as socialists in the u.s what our project has to look like it has to look like socialism with american characteristics we have to build it on our material conditions on our history on our culture um now i i it's not very often that i find a marxist or socialist academic who is um who does take what we consider to be these proper anti-imperialist positions so i wanted to ask you how has it been sort of traversing academia as a communist and and the type of communists that actually support socialist experiments um i don't i feel like a little a lot of times what i'd have done in my academic career is is try to hide you know i feel a little bit like a sleeper cell that's just been activated you know um because i you know like i mean i've always been a marxist right i mean like that was my that was my political awakening i mean since i was like a teenager you know um but i wasn't always like damn and i'm a communi i mean it wasn't like that right a lot a lot of times i would you know leave it in the background or i wouldn't talk to somebody about politics or you know i mean i think it's kind of like it's fear it's it's not wanting to piss people off it's not wanting to alienate people it's like we're already so [ __ ] alienated you know like um but it's also like okay academia is part of the establishment you know i mean like the right would like us to believe that it's a hotbed of you know marxist indoctrination it is not that you know i mean marxism is in an uneasy place in academia you know i mean like and you can see this because while it's true that a lot of people have read something of marx or whatever or say that they're influenced by it or whatever the fact is the only permissible marxists to read in academia or to study in academia are those that never held political power you know those are the ones that are pure those are the ones that are non-dangerous you know like i mean there's a reason why like people love gramsci you know uh and but if they don't love you know articles and books and art stuff about stalin you know i mean like and that that is not about i mean stalin wrote a lot of stuff right i mean like you could you could study that stuff you could write about it some people do but it tends to be outside of academia because academia is so focused on theory you know and and it it doesn't get into like when you get into politics politics is a mess you know like you have to be weighing policies on so many different levels right and that is complex and contradictory you know um that's just that's what politics is you know and so i feel like a lot of my uh you know relationship with academia um i have a very uneasy relationship there um and you know i mean by the way i'm not like some academic superstar you know like i'm not well known in my field by any means you know like i haven't i haven't published a lot of peer-reviewed stuff you know like i've published a book that came out of my dissertation but i think that's kind of the um that's the bargain that you're put in at the community college level right you're you're teaching at an intro level you're at the like lowest wrong in the elitist system and so you know you don't get like you don't get like a lot of respect or you know not that i'm in the game for that but you you you know what i'm saying like it's not like other economists are like oh what does dr bear think i need to know right i mean you know i'm like a unknown figure right unless people follow me on twitter or something like that i don't know um i think academia is is definitely you know on the hostile side um to especially if you want to study you know the soviet union or china if you want to study marx's theory abstractly you'd probably do that yeah a lot of frankfurt school not enough lenin and and the people that actually did something that's in philosophy but even in economics the um the discipline's kind of been poisoned by like the chicago school and by the koch brothers just dumping money into it our we had a great politics professor who studied in china and he was a marxist but we all i had an economics professor who was the head of the local gop and her her whole pitch on socialism this would was all she would do would say um venezuela was really rich when they had oil and then they implemented socialism and now they're poor and that was it and that actually i mean that spurred me to end up writing my undergrad thesis on venezuela and i was like that should be illegal for her to teach venezuela and socialism like that is so wrong and simplified wow i mean every time somebody tells me um yeah i i've you know i have a very con conflicted relationship with my field you know like like you know i'll put out a tweet or something and i'll be like look economics field is trash you know and then and then people will be like hell yes it is and i feel like oh damn it you know now i'm you know oh it kind of hurts even though i'm gonna put this out you know but like i i hear these stories and i'm like ah it's even worse than i know you know like because i'm not taking these intro classes i mean i took them back in the day right but i don't know what's out there now you know i'm like as bad as i thought it was it might be worse it's nice though that you're just teaching like intro to micro and macro because that's what i appreciated from my economics education and college's biases bias as it was to kind of learn some of those basic i don't know even vocabulary words in economics that you're kind of sharing on your channel like that's cool yeah well i mean i started that because of the pandemic and because we were you know like we had to lecture online and stuff and i thought well let's let's do it on a youtube channel and maybe yeah maybe it'll be helpful to others but i mean i mostly did it for my own students and um that's why i like turned off the comments on but so like the first ones i uploaded were like the micron macro because you know those were the courses that i was teaching that was a kind of you know the pressing need of the time but i mean my favorite course to teach is the political economy course which you know i do a sign marks and mao and i assign stalin i mean you know i so these are courses which go into much more the like actual political details uh you know i mean i do the theory as well but and then we we uh we study the history of the soviet union uh you know i have videos on that as well um so you know these are i think like much more controversial much more like um you know it's much more detailed you don't have the time in micro or macro to really get into like what is socialism because there's such a set curriculum in those courses you know like the most you can do is be like look here's the history of capitalism here's some criticisms of capitalism you know um i'm gonna try to teach this stuff critically but i do want students to learn it you know like i'm not i'm not an ideologue in that sense in my you know in my normal teaching job i try to do a good job of presenting bourgeois theory um you know i mean i think you can probably do a better job or i don't know maybe it's just different you know if you if you are a critic of something you're going to see the weaknesses of it you know you're going to focus on that so and you know that motivates you to really understand it you know like um so i mean that's but that's my view right obviously i think that i'm i do a good job at what i do one of the things you mentioned is uh who you assign in in your course of political economy you said stalin mao and lenin what what has been the the funniest reaction you have received from a student once they've looked at the curriculum um i had a student i had a student the first time i taught the course i had a student who was like very right-wing and she was a good student you know like she was talking classes this was back in the in-person days it's pre-covered right um she would talk in class and she had good things to say whatever but as the semester wound on i started seeing like well this is actually somebody who's like a real like trump reactionary you know and she got mad like at the class and would leave she'd leave like 10 minutes into the class she'd just be like [ __ ] this you know and like i mean she didn't say that but she would just grab and you know there's like 20 people in the class right like because this is the it's a smaller class usually the classes usually community college classes are full you know they're usually like 40 or 45 or whatever this one was smaller and so you know it's like very obvious and she didn't even sit in the back you know she'd just be like get up and leave and i'm like you should probably stay you know you're gonna be you're gonna like do better in the class like if you actually come to class you know and uh it was so you know i had but this person just just did not do the reading just did not engage with it you know like i wouldn't mind having like a smart conservative who actually you know wants to like read and engage in this stuff like you know you don't you don't need to agree with me about everything for us to have a good conversation right like um i don't know i think they were just i don't think that it was about the reading list there exactly it was more like that that i was taking socialism as a concept seriously and you know um yeah it's it's weird it's weird because the first half of the course i talk a lot about capitalism you know i talk a lot about feudalism i talk a lot about slavery you know because i want that i want the students to have that sense of like you know socialism doesn't arise out of nowhere right it arises out of a response to you know thousands of years of society being based on brutal exploitation and then we get a new form of that with capitalism but we don't get an end to it we don't you know we don't get like a situation where people are not exploiting you you know you get to choose your exploiter okay that's new um so yeah i don't know i don't know how students react to the the the reading list you know it's hard to say for sure so you mentioned how um you talk about slavery and how that was itself a different economic system than capitalism and then one of your books is about prison labor and carlos and i were lucky enough we got to teach some classes um we used we called them our socialist night school events when we were still in undergrad and during black history thank you and during black history month we taught we showed the documentary film 13th and talked about um how the drug war and how prison labor has essentially replaced slavery and how as soon as the drug war was implemented you see incarceration rate skyrocketing uh you just want to talk about that a little bit and then maybe what you want to see done as far as um changing that other than just socialism um sure um you know i uh i started this project uh in the 90s you know and it was like that was a period where um you know the the prison population was skyrocketing and there was a kind of moment where people kind of noticed it you know like where it came to the attention of the left you know like i mean i think leftists have always been concerned with what is going on in prison because it's like you know here's a group of highly marginalized highly oppressed people right and you know that we should be concerned with that right i mean as as people who want you know to improve uh human well-being and um but there was a moment where people started going whoa it's crazy now you know like the population is exploding what is going on um that was the moment where i got into it and a lot of people were looking at prison labor and saying you know this is this is slavery but they would not usually give a very systematic explanation of that they would give a very surface level explanation they'd be like uh you know the inmates don't get paid or something right and so yeah like i you know and i i thought about this and i'm like this is it's an argument i agree with but i don't think it's a very strong argument you know like how do you deal with it when it when somebody's hostile to it you know like like what if somebody says well they get paid you know here's where they get paid over here does that make it not slavery i mean like i think it's it's weird to say okay here's one thing i mean it's essentialism again right to say here's one characteristic that you if it either has it and it's fine if it doesn't have it and it's this other thing you know so i'm like well let's examine all of the forces that produce the situation in prisons that surround the labor process in prisons what is the culture that goes on there right what are the economic relationships that produce this kind of production um you know what are they what are the political conditions we have a very different political environment in prison you know um you have i mean you know businesses people are caged against their will by force you know i mean that's that's a very very different than what's on the outside so i think you know what i do in my work is look at it holistically right and say all of these things going on produces a unique constellation of forces and that is a form of slavery it's a form that is similar in some ways to antebellum slavery that's kind of like our model in the united states right because that's the form that we you know to the extent that anybody studies this we like we get some coverage of that like in school right so we we we naturally think of that as being like the pure form of slavery or whatever like if we're going to construct an essentialism but of course slavery has gotten many varied forms throughout history and that's part of what i studied um you know like the slavery of ancient rome for example it's very different than antebellum slavery um but i just wanted to look at like what are the essential qualities if there are any right without making it an essentialism but to say okay these are these are you have to focus on a few things you know i mean that's what theory is um so in doing that in in prison i mean i do i do confirm that finding right i mean i would say yes it's a unique form of slavery um and and then what are the consequences of that how has that changed over time what should you do i think you have a very problematic view of kind of labor in general that comes out of you know mainstream economic view which is basically like labor is disutility right labor is toil labor is a negative marxism doesn't look at it that way right i mean marxism says like labor is people interacting with nature and with each other you know like that's not and to say that's a negative it's crazy right i mean what makes it a negative somebody brutally exploiting you that makes it a negative right that makes it into work that you don't like so labor doesn't have to be like that right i mean labor and i think that's that's the dream of marxism is to say we could create a society where we don't view it as a negative because the exploitation of one person by another is a memory of the past right so you know i think it's like you'd like to get to that point it is hard to look at prison and be like prison is you know it's one of the most oppressive environments if not the most that we've managed to create in the modern world you know like how do you make that right when you know um i mean i don't know exactly like because the contradiction is if you say well prison inmates just shouldn't work that is also problematic you know because labor is a fundamental kind of activity you know i mean labor is it is a form of self-development you know so to say well inmates should not get that well then what do you what do you do then solitary confinement stare to wall i mean that's that's also very problematic i mean that might be even more of a torment than having something to do to take your mind off of it you know so you know can can you have labor that is not a regime of exploitation in prison i think you could it's but it's hard because prison has a lot of history behind it you know it has a lot of like you know we there's a reason why it was so easy to go from you know antebellum slavery to you know the the convict leasing system in the south you know like um because you know those are like very similar regimes of exploitation and um you know there weren't slaves of slaves of course were not incarcerated you know i mean that that wasn't part of antebellum slavery it's like you know a slave was going to be you know is going to be owned by somebody and exploited by somebody they were not put in jail if they were punished it was going to be corporal punishment right not being put in a cage you were gonna get whipped you know or you were gonna get if you tried to escape a bunch of times you get your foot cut off i mean you know they're pretty brutal punishments but they did not incarcerate slaves so that i think it's correct to say that happened afterwards you know that happened as a response to the abolitionist slavery and i think you know in the grand scheme of things if i could connect this i'd say um we we did not abolish slavery fully but we did marginalize it you know like the number of inmates that are that are incarcerated and are enslaved um is smaller than under the under the period right like and if we look at it as a relative importance to the economy any any dimension we'd have to say look slavery was pushed into a corner you know it wasn't fully abolished but you know it's it's still good that we abolish you know like i mean it's good that it's made illegal outside prisons i mean it's not great that there's a loophole but um you know it's probably it's incomplete progress i guess i would i would call it that's funny that we touch on that point um what i teach is ethics and i have my sections today and and what we had to what i had to teach was the defensive punishment so the deontological utilitarian defensive but of of punishment um but yeah that's that's very interesting um eddie do you have anything else to ask before perhaps wrap it up um not really is there anything you want to shout out or promote here oh we'll link the the china videos uh down below so that everyone can see it as well so yeah yeah i mean right now what i'm working on um i just started my semester again so i i'll have more videos coming out um right now i'm just working on a reading of the communist manifesto i started reading theory i started with uh mouse on contradiction because that was a text that i assigned for my class and i thought well maybe i'll help people out by doing a reading of it and then you know if you have that option instead of reading you could listen um and then it turned out it was like oh that was a relatively popular like video and stuff and so i think it's you know with theory it's kind of like well maybe not everybody's a reader you know uh it's good to have different options for people um but it's funny because i you know i get into the reading the manifesto whenever you read something out loud you really uh you see it in a different way you know and uh and i'm like this is actually a very deep text you know there's a lot of things that i had overlooked about this because i was always like a manifesto uh read capital you know like but but it really is a very good summary of uh a lot of those those themes that you find fully worked out later on um so that i mean that's probably the next thing people will they'll see uh but you know if people want to interact with me more you know i'd love to see uh you know on twitter and whatever um i i write a lot uh different threads and tweets and stuff um about these two themes you know what is what is socialism was communism and also about meditation and you know how does one develop oneself uh you know in the midst of all this awesome yeah i encourage everyone to go check out your channel um you've got good videos there on the on the prison labor stuff and on china and on meditation so thank you so much for sitting down and talking with us dr bear we really appreciate it we'd love to have you on again sometime um absolutely thanks so much for having me appreciate you dr bear thank you and we hope to have you again
