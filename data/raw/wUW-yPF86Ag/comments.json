You could be at a restaurant on the other side of town and they happen to be there too, guess who's going to stop by your table to say hi? \nAnd then they talk about being embarrassed. I don't think there is much these people are embarrassed by. They seem to be embarrassed if their child who is holding a metal Stanley container is getting beat up by another child who doesn't have a weapon. That seems to reflect poorly on their parenting skills. \nIt's simple math. Remove God and remove the father in a family and you destroy the family.
