You can only do this by removing the kids from the parents in boarding schools and physically punishing bad behavior with no bars held. We need to stop placating them and start forcing them to assimilate into \"whiteness\" aka manners.",

You could be at a restaurant on the other side of town and they happen to be there too, guess who's going to stop by your table to say hi? \nAnd then they talk about being embarrassed. I don't think there is much these people are embarrassed by. They seem to be embarrassed if their child who is holding a metal Stanley container is getting beat up by another child who doesn't have a weapon. That seems to reflect poorly on their parenting skills. \nIt's simple math. Remove God and remove the father in a family and you destroy the family. It's really very simple and Satan laughing spreads his wings.",

There still needs to be an actual consequence, but a kid who respects his parent follows his parent’s expectations out of that respect.
