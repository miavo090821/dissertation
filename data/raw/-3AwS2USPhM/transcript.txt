welcome back everybody today I'm joined by a returning guest of the program it's comrade Carlos Gedo of Midwestern marks and the still relatively new American Communist Party who's joining us today as the title of the video suggest to talk about the ACP its foundation but also the how that relates to the the real life of the American worker in this period of decaying imperialism so very happy to have him back on the show and so I welcome back Carlos good to have you with us thank you for having me on comrade it's the third time we get to speak and the other two have been very delightful conversations your show is one of my favorite on YouTube so it's a real pleasure to be here well good to good to have you here at a time when I think I was discussing this with another guest yesterday kit Claren BG whose work you might be familiar with journalist for the gry Zone a British Exile living in Serbia who uh we well we we were discussing like how Empires fall apart basically how imperialis particularly imperialism in its crisis moment and I wanted to talk to you about this today in reference to particularly the life of the of the of the working class in the Imperial core countries obviously the United States ruling class took on the mantle of leadership of an entire imperialist block after 1945 and has led it since then now it's facing I would call it a endpoint crisis uh where it has multiple challenges that externally it cannot really overcome and those challenges and weaknesses of imperialism are going to being revealed all the time whether it's by Hamas and Hezbollah and Iran or whether it's by the US imperialism and British imperialism's inability to uh deal with the rise of Chinese um industrial and scientific power or Russian military power in Ukraine we are in an all fronts crisis of imperialism but this relates then back to the internal question inside the United States which is that life for the American worker for the domestic American working class has been portrayed by us propagandists for a long time as being the ultimate reason why socialism isn't required this was always the argument in the Cold War the American worker has all lives in uh they all live in detached houses with a garage two cars and you know um their life have a life that most of the world could could barely even dream of that is even to my limited knowledge having not set foot in your country for a long time but even just reading about it in academic studies and through looking at even American government statistics Life of the American worker in this long downward downward swing period of imperialism is getting harder it is getting uh more more brutish and the expectations of life that the American worker has are being more cruy dashed in every successive generation since the 1970s so given given that situation and facing this crisis um you would have think that us imperialism's strategists would come up with something to try and do something to address this decline but it seems that they are unable to they're unable to offer any real reform to the domestic working class what they've done is they've provided a political theater of the Absurd in terms of the the Trump Harris uh uh presidential race revealing so much about what the U the presidential office actually means under imperialism and perhaps we can discuss that later but they offer no reform they offer No Way Forward they offer no hope at all to the American worker that anything will get any better so given all of that like the urgency for a return of real class politics in the United States is more actually uh vital than ever given that the future under decaying imperialism only leads to real life slow death by despair so I wanted to get your take on like what the the life of the the the real conditions of the American worker right now in the in the United States and the inability of the ruling class to even pretend to address this well I think you hit the nail on the absolute head in terms of uh the conditions that we have here in the US we had a period of time in the 20th century and we cannot lie about this where there was the ability to accumulate in sectors of the working class there was periods of serious Financial stability it was called the golden era of American capitalism or at least in the white part of the working class their experience was elevated to one of uh you know what Engles would have called the basified middle class with stability with two automobiles the two kids two and a half dogs or something like that the white picket fence um the American dream and this was a dream that was a part of a very uh limited section of the working class the black part of the working class wasn't participant in this uh dream in fact for most of uh the history of this uh dream the black part of the working class lived under conditions virtually of AP parite up until 1964 what has happened since the 70s is that that condition that was developed out of a few factors strong labor movement backed up by a Communist Party the fact that we were the Imperial core we still are but this super profits super exploitation that we did of the global South allowed for crumbs to be given to parts of the working class and you also had a strong alternative U Paradigm in the existence of the Soviet Union those are three Central factors upon which the reality of that stability is based what has happened to those factors while the uh unions have been utterly destroyed the Communist parties have been destroyed not just through repression but through the promotion of this thing that calls itself the left that you know it's it's as left as a as a chicken with a duck bill calling itself a duck you know it's not left at all um it's created by the institutions of the State Department of the CIA Etc by the Congress for cultural Freedom it's focused on cultural issues on issues of social morality uh and other Affairs it's dominated in terms of World viw by what I've called the Purity fetish and in terms of class position by the professional managerial stratum you know a stratum that is relatively comfortable in their day-to-day life um you had of course the counterrevolution in the Soviet Union that kind of shot down that alternative Paradigm that was readily uh visible and so this creates the conditions around the 1970s for a uh turn towards more austerity and towards the process that we have called following Noah kivik at The Institute repr proletarianization where that sector of the American working class that basified itself has been periodically repr proletarianized now instead of their lives being dominated by stability and the ability to accumulate the ability to go out twice for dinner every week and have a few vacations now instead of that they have what every basically every American experiences which is drowning in debt difficulties figuring out how to make ends meet I mean 80% of the American public is living paycheck to paycheck that means they're one paycheck away from being thrown into the streets with the 650,000 homeless people living in a country with 33 times as many empty homes as homeless people on top of that they've seen other forms of cultural crisises arise the rise of addiction and and crime and a whole host of other things that make life unbearable so all in all what existed of that middle class has died it has been repr proletarianized and the lives of the American people today are plagued by poverty by instability by debt and by General desperation and it's been that uh destruction of that material base of stability that has at the level of the thoughts that people have at the ideological level uh accounted for the crisis of legitimacy that we have in our country the fact that today only 19% of the American people actually feel like their representatives represent them is a historic fact I can't pinpoint any other period in American history where that has been the case the fact that only 11% of the American public actually believes in what the mainstream media says it's a historic fact what we have in our hands is a crisis of legitimacy the way the world has worked is no longer working for American working people and now they're conscious of it they don't want to keep on going on in the old way and given the crisis of imperialism that we have even the ruling class itself cannot continue to go on in the old way and as good leninists we know what that means when neither the working people nor the ruling class can continue to go on in the old way one of the interesting things that happens in 2016 is that you have the development of the Maga movement where Trump through this populous rhetoric of ending the wars bringing back the jobs at some point he was even arguing for u a sort of universal healthare he's able to win a significant part of that disaffected workingclass based that historically voted for Democrats in most counties in the Midwest for instance the people that voted for Trump were Obama Obama and then Trump you know so that's something that's left off of uh the discussion these people are just painted by the Liberals as a basket of racist deplorables but one of the things that Trump suggested that really got a lot of their ears was bringing manufacturing Blue Collar jobs back he of course did not do that just like he didn't end the wars or do anything else he promised as a good politician it's almost illegal if a politician within the context of capitalism fulfills the things he promises it's like it's very bad form for them to do that but for the American people people that was an exciting Paradigm the ability to have the jobs that provided their parents or their grandparents the stability that they were raised listening to the problem is that you know capitalism is a system that has certain laws that we have to study um Hegel was the the one following Spinosa and this is taken up by Marxism as well that argued that freedom is the recognition of necessity in a social context that means that we have to understand to be truly free the necessity of the social laws that are driving forth capitalist development that's the only way we can intervene and and either changing them or or or destroying them or uh deviating them from their course as best as possible writing the tiger as China has kind of done what we have to realize is that in the context of the US and I would say to a to a lesser but still true extent in Britain and in other parts of uh uh Europe the fleeing of productive capital abroad is not something that can be undone within the confines of the capitalist mode of life because it was a necessity behind that fleeing there was a deep period of Crisis that people are perhaps too young or too unread to remember in the 70s that led to Capital needing to go abroad in order to find cheaper variable Capital cheaper labor power for the capitalist to buy and therefore increased the rate of profit so that cannot be undone within the confin of a society that produces for the sake of profit and capital accumulation and not for the sake of meeting human needs so we have this crisis in our hands where the working class is uh rocking the boat ideologically they're no longer believing the ideas of the past and not like in previous eras it's generalized across the whole working population and it cannot be undone because in previous areas you can have uh sort of FDR like programs of uh you know public works or in you know um uh promote the productive economy through other means but today that's virtually impossible um it would go against the logic of the system itself so it's a very interesting time to be a communist in the US um and I I think this is what creates the context or the need for an organization such as the ACP well yes I mean I what you said there reminded me actually we just had a a national budget for the year done this week by our rather pretentiously titled Finance Minister um the chancellor of the ex jerker um um but what reading I was doing a a live stream on that we're going through it and what occurred to me was that essentially for all that they denounce Trump they're they're all trying the same things he did which is by trying to essentially bribe Capital to invest because that's what they're doing here they're talking about oh we're going to build renewable energy how you going to do it well we're going to have um an energy company that isn't actually an energy company it's a clearing house for money it's a means by which money goes through out of the government through this company to private companies to try and throw State subsidies at them to encourage them to um Enga invest in what they refer to as green energy and also to do it uh do the manufacturing of the relevant Parts here in Britain but of course they're not interested in doing that they're not and then what they're going to do is they're going to do exactly what they've done before which is take the money uh and then say can we have some more and the state will pay them again hoping that they'll invest something because the the the rate of profit for investing in Britain has is too low and it's been too low for at least 60 years you can make an argument actual fact that it probably started in the 1860s in terms of the de-industrialization because British manufacturing stopped reinvesting in a lot of Industries after really the 1850s and as some American Writers have observed uh in terms of production of means of production American capitalism outstrip British capitalism by the 1850s in many areas especially in the sort of production line technology and so the British capitalists rather than invest in new means of production sent the money to the colonies they sent the money to certain parts of India to certain parts of the African nations rather than reinvest at home so what you say there is completely correct you can't turn that around whether you're Donald Trump and you're calling it Maga or whether you're kiss St and you're calling it what is it you referred to it as social democracy for the 21st century or whatever that whatever the awful  he's going on about this week and the you you most of the so-called left in Britain looking at that budget just said oh well he should have gone further but it's all but it's all right really that's like most of the sort of labor party people there's no understanding of the fact that it's not a reversible process what's gone on the car industry under capitalism isn't going to come back you know no matter how much the only thing you're going to get is and this is an experiment they're trying here now which is we're actually we've actually got special economic zones in Britain now which are being turned into supposedly deregulatory paradises um so that's their solution here I'm pretty sure that with the with the way that the US capitalism is organized or they what they seem to be doing there is shoving like car plants into Deep South states which are actively anti-union and you seem to be going through a similar process there which is that the ruling class it knows it's got to do something but it's only solution is well let's we've got to reduce the American worker to the same condition that we would we would find in Indonesia or uh Thailand or Cambodia and so we got to make it if we're going to do anything it's going to be non-union we're going to get the states and the federal government to back us up on this and it's we're going to have it done by the most hyper exploitable layer of the population we can possibly find so in my view the only way that Britain or the United States gets back any manufacturing is if they actually make life for the worker far worse in terms of driving down wages because that's the only way this is going to be profitable and that's of course Trump I don't think understands that I think some American capitalists are cynical enough to understand it but most of the politicians aren't but again without a Marxist understanding of this you as a as a leftist a leftist will just be led into taking all kinds of like contradictory stances um that make no sense because fundamentally the the process cannot be reversed here and as lenon observed it is it is this is part and parcel of imperialism so before we would could even get to the point where we could rebuild this country or you uh uh you you could rebuild the um the United States us manufacturing the current ruling class would have to be pushed aside you you can't you can't reform the you that you can't have any kind of um you know reform process anymore because that periods just completely disappeared and so the the reality of another another Trump term if and it from from outside that's looks like it's what it's going to be is that the the policies will evolve towards an even more Relentless war on the American worker and there and to drive wages down to the point where the the American ruling class is prepared to invest again I mean that's my read on your situation because it seems fairly similar to ours yeah I mean what you mentioned about the car manufacturing industry I mean I think it's the only serious productive industry that hasn't taken uh that big of a hit I mean we're actually producing I think 10 times more cars now than we were um I think in the 1970s is the the statistic I I recently saw but the I mean they're trying to basically accomplish within the nation what the export of capital in search of uh cheaper raw materials and in search of Cheaper labor accomplished uh since the 1970s by taking it to the US South um and and doing non-union jobs as you mentioned and I think part of the reason why that industry hasn't um exported in the way that others have is frankly because of its signed value like it people like in America they like feeling like they have an American Automobile and if they knew that that automobile wasn't made in America it would hurt the sign value The Prestige uh that's behind the commodity that they're buying and that has made itself perhaps artificially or artificially an indispensable um instrument for Modern Life at least in the us because we don't have public uh transport unless you want to get stabed um in in New York subways or something so um we have to realize and this is something that people usually just read volume one of uh Capital they don't read all the way through but Marx talks about this in in volume three capital as it develops is going to develop into higher and higher levels of abstraction and financialization and people tend to see the process of financialization that we've seen in the west has some sort of break but in reality it's a it's a firm continuity with the logic of capital I mean today we have a situation in the US where like uh the largest you know 500 companies most of their profits and most of the areas that their capital is being reinvested in which is what capital has to do in order to be Capital has to be reinvested in capital accumulation what sectors are they going towards they're going towards rents interest uh rates and stock BuyBacks so as parasitic as you can possibly uh get um it's it's quite literally in most instances making money from money itself and as uh as a logical development of the capitalist mode of production what that produces at the level of individuals is a keen awareness of the heightening of these contradictions these people are literally getting rich without producing anything there's not there we have cities collapsing all around us but somehow these parasites continue to grow bigger and bigger and bigger while all of our Lives continue to fall into misery and indebtedness and that's part of the natural tendency the part the lawfulness of the Social Development of capitalism and it cannot be undone unless the uh the social order itself is is radically transformed and the working class comes into a position of political power well it's interesting you mentioned the uh the financialization being there from the baked into the capitalist cake so to speak I mean as you say Marx talks about that um and Engles elaborates it on it first in volume two and then volume three of capital where he says that the circuit goes from money commodity to money to the capitalist trying to cut out the commodity part and just going from money to money and the remarkable thing when I read that for the first time and actually understood it I was like that that was an incredible Revelation to me because that's exactly the process in Britain it's like first send production overseas then stop investing in production almost entirely just move the money around and come up with a profit at the end of it so it's exactly the process that was gone through and the tragic thing was that and here we'll get into talking about the failures of the previous generation of communist parties that our Communist party as was but cpgb as it was once called didn't appear to have um actually absorbed that point which is such a crucial point in terms of understanding how capitalism goes if you read that and then you read Lenin's imperialism to it D take those conclusions that Marx had um brought together in C the three volumes of capital and apply it to the system That Grew From the 1860s onwards the imperialist system the modern imperialist system then you would understand that manufacturing under capitalism was doomed but in in our case because the old Communist Party had attached itself mon ically to the idea of social democracy and the idea that their role was to not work patiently for the point where the Social Democratic settlement would break down but to defend it at all costs even when the working class was open to more revolutionary outcomes more revolutionary Solutions and so they defended it and defended it and defended it until they withered away until or they lost all of their workingclass cada and just became basically a bunch of academics and Trade union officials frantically defending the labor party at all costs and that comes I think partially from a massive theoretical failure a failure to understand that you cannot restrain the the motion of capital um with laws with social Dem social democracy with even even like militant stances of workers in struggle to defend what they've got as Marx observes in a book I'm reading with this the study group at the moment value price and profit he observes in there that most workingclass struggles are defensive and they're going to lead ultimately either to defeat or a a very temporary Victory because that that is the nature of the of of the the system we live under the capitalists are obliged by the very fact of their class position to continually attack they don't have a choice that's that's their system and the worker is obliged to struggle and but the the Communist is obliged to step in and and point to the worker that not only needn't you be in a world of Perpetual struggle for very little benefit or marginal benefit but also that the the natural place for the worker is to become the ruler to become the ruler of society at large and I think that so many communist parties in the Imperial Corp completely lost sight of all of that after 1945 and never recovered which leads us to of course the uh the discussion of the the founding of the ACP and the necessity of that because your own former Communist Party the PC the cpusa had completely gone off the rails probably for about as long as ours had and had given up on all of that and become an appendage of the democratic party now you and other comrades um were were involved in a struggle inside of the old cpusa to try and break it away from the Democrats that ultimately was U undemocratically destroyed by um by genocide Joe Sims I think his name is um in his fanatical defense of uh Joe Biden at all costs and of course the the ACP partially grows out of that struggle now you've just had recently the first Congress of the ACP it's attracting a lot of interest and a lot of genuine excitement it seems from people who've gone through this painful process of learning over the last few years especially people in like their 20s 30s early 40s who've been through all these disappointments and have come out ready to actually look at well what does being a communist actually mean again so now you're into this process a few months down the line given what we've just been discussing in the foreground of this uh this this back and forth we've been having how do you feel about the the foundation of the party after the first Congress what is your what is your reflection on um how things are going and the the opportunity that this is actually opening up for Communists in the United States now yeah um that's a great question and just to be clear it was a convention our first Congress will be in 2026 um okay it's where we uh we're able to ratify our party's uh program and the Constitution and then in due time we'll be able to have elections for a Central Committee which will then in the Congress in 2026 postulate the series of goals for the party for the next period but um so how do how do I feel about the ACP in terms of uh its relationship to to our context I I feel it's indispensable um we are working within one of the things that the old left uh did if you can even call it left um was that they would create alternative communities of like leftist and then try to almost like invade workingclass communities with those communities and if those communities they not live up to the expectation of the leftist communities they would be condemned we are taking a different approach we are recognizing the fact that there's already communities there and if we're ever going to win anyone instead of sort of coming in from outside we have to work from the communities that we're already a part of the uh shop floors that we're a part of the actual Civil Society institutions that we participate in and one of the main focuses of the party uh in in these last few months and will continue of course to be one of the main focus is winning the people through Deeds we have this sort of uh idea that you know the way we are going to win the general public and the working class is simply through convincing them through having the best arguments and the reality is good arguments are good you know they they play a role when you're speaking to people but I think most people are convinced by Deeds you know when they see that the communities they live in are filled with hazardous waste with garbage and then here come the Communists they clean it for no charge you know and if you talk to them they're normal people they're not blue-haired leftists telling you to abolish the family and criticizing you for having more than two kids or something because the planet is going to explode if we have babies or something so it's uh I I think through serving our communities we prove indeed what communism is all about and in a country that has been so steeped into mccarthyite fears and paranoia uh we show people what we are through our actions and then when they talk to us I think that the way of us presenting communism is infinitely more effective than any of the groups that have came uh before us in the the the recent past I mean the way that we presented here in the US is in a way that is rooted in our understanding of the Common Sense that the American people are operating with what gry called their spontaneous philosophies of course they're incoherent the society they live in is incoherent and irrational but there's Common Sense rational kernels there and it's our job to tease those out and every American worker believes in the vision of democracy as a government or a society of by and for the people and there's nothing easier than letting them know that the society we have today is government of buying for big capital for big corporations investment firms and big banks for the military industrial complex and for the politicians in whose pockets all of these major corporations are in in fact sometimes we don't even have to tell them most of them already know this but we do have to tell them and this is where both the establishment and the so-called leftist produced by that establishment lie is that that Vision that they have for what America could be the words uttered by Lincoln and the Gettysburg Address government devb for the people that's socialism when you have a society that works for workingclass people for the vast majority of the society that is not a capitalist Society because the interest that Reigns Supreme is not that of capital accumulation what makes capitalism capitalism in part there's obviously a lot of components but the central component is that what comes to reign supreme in every aspect of society in every calculation is the need for the accumulation of capital if the society that you're going to be governing has as the basis of its most essential need the people the satisfaction of uh the needs of the working class the elevation of uh their living standards and if the people doing all of that are working people in my view that's socialism that's the essence of socialism we can talk back and forth about various other terms that we can classify that as but um when I present socialism as that Vision that the American people already accept it is much more efficient and then if they ask about you know what's dictatorship of the proletariat you know I explain that but I think that we're in a context where what we have to do is show indeed What communists are actually about connect communism to a vision that at least in part already exists EMB bionically in the common sense of the American uh public and then do other things on that basis once we're embedded in communities once we have won the trust of the people um and this is another thing like leftists treat Socialist Communist organizing as if the goal is to make every person a Communist Party member that's not uh the assumption that we're operating with yes the most uh the advanced Detachment will join the party um and one of the things that separates us from other organizations is that according to our director of personnel Kyle Pettis anywhere from 70 to 80% of our members are blue collar workers I had a meeting the other day with chapter Executives three of them were wearing um two of them were wearing Minor's hat one of them was wearing a rail hat because they stepped to the side from work they took a break in order to join the meeting I mean I uh I challenge you find one organization in the US left that has ever had that class uh in the last 40 50 years it's impossible to find so one of the things that we're trying to do is integrate ourselves into these already existing communities show people that oh this was the point that I was going to make not everyone has to be a part of the party I mean the party also needs a sort of sympathetic mass that maybe doesn't even understand what communism is but that just knows that the Communists are the people that bringing home the results and that's part of what we're trying to build that dual process of developing a hardened Cadre of honorable you know uh High Caliber people but also winning the trust of the communities that in due time two three years from now when we're running in Municipal elections or or or local elections will realize okay I have these options I have the uh red exploiter the blue exploiter I have the Communists that have been serving my communities for all these years that have developed sort of small communist Enterprises in my communities that are actually enjoyable and that are not the same reproduced uh Cosmopolitan businesses we see in every corner of the country and that have actually put forth a program that represents me is rooted in the needs that they know that I have because of these interactions and that will serve those needs so that's the three-prong strategy that we have been working with integrate ourselves into communities through Community Service uh which also means integrate ourselves into unions and and the work class struggle develop communist Enterprises which is a very heterodox part of our party we've gotten a lot of flak online uh forward from leftist but to do anything in the capitalist West you need to have Capital you know um and we think that when we create the situation where chapters are able to have members come together and pull their resources and think creatively about what sort of Enterprise they can create to serve the needs of their community develop uh their own Capital to do community service and do all these other things we think that that has a a dual effect that allows us to survive in terms of um you know having the capital necessary to operate which every organization needs irrespective of its political character but it also shows to the American public that this myth that they have been told about Communists as the people that are coming in and and just abolishing uh the small things that they own taking away their small businesses that has nothing no bearing with uh reality at least not in in the communism of the 21st century and the last component is on that whole basis the Enterprises the community service running political campaigns not for the sake as some other leftist organizations do of losing but getting um getting seen but for the sake of actually winning local elections showing that we can at least in one area one domain win over the people and with the resources of that domain serve them in ways that are efficient and if we can't do that and do so successfully then maybe we don't deserve to to be in power if we can't win over a municipality and serve it and make the people happy what right do we have to claim ourselves for ourselves the the right to run the country so that's sort of the results oriented uh basis of of our organization and how I think we can provide some something useful for the class struggle in America well the ruling class in the United States certainly understood the um the value of ejecting Communists from the working class um which is what the house on American Activities Committee was really all about before we get even get to like the the Hollywood trials and Joseph McCarthy's prominence it was about expelling working worker militants from the unions um and the industries themselves eles in the later in the mid to later 1940s so the the the ruling class understands that very well that if there's going if they have to put up with the left being in place then it will be one that is not a part of the working class at all that it will be one that is separated from it and unfortunately they did manage to do that in the United States in the' 40s they did manage to um destroy the Communist presence in the unions largely with some assistance from our old friends and the trotskyites but that's another story um but they they they put a great deal of value on achieving that because they understood and their strategists understood um people like James Burnham in fact another former Trotsky uh did know very well that the strength of the um the the communist movement lies in its interrelatedness and embeddedness within the working class and if you remove that then the Communist um you know is a is the head of a spear without the rest of the spear behind it you know with there's without without the um just a spear Point means nothing you know uh without the rest of the class behind it the Vanguard is a drift and that's what that's the process that started to happen I think in many countries but especially where the counterrevolutionary repression was very great inside the US after World War II because they were desperate to clamp down and retain their very firm control control over the what was the homeland for the International imperialist System there back back then and now so the idea of actually going to the masses and you to get a bit maist about it for a second be among them and learn from them is something that as you say most of the left in the United States Britain Europe has turned its back on I think this is typified by the the the commune movement in in decades like the 196 s especially in the US where you had one of the largest like migrations in history out of the cities and into like the uh the rural areas where people would set up their own communes and try and live apart from capitalism which you just cannot do uh it's it's a complete um completely utopian idea but that act of separating literally separating yourself from the rest of the class and thinking that you can find some uh strange way of becoming immune to the pressures of capital that is one of the most destructive and stupid ideas that in the history of Western leftism and as you say if they can't do that then they'll form a weird community and try and take it back into the working class again and saying well you all now must accept this otherwise you're a bunch of reactionaries then they get really offended when people tell them to off uh but there you go um so I think I I see it as the as positive that the ACP would be attacked for wanting to to actually integrate yourselves with the class and actually reestablished what the the old the old grami term referred to as the organic intellectuals of the working class so that is the idea that a Communist Party member is a knowledgeable person wi within his or her community or workplace who understands U understands a situation that the class finds itself in and can explain things in a way not a dumb down way but in a Rel able way that the class can understand and rally behind and help to organize itself around and again the ruling class understands the the risks and dangers of that which is why they created a left that doesn't do it they created a left that is fanatically opposed to it I mean I believe I saw one of your prominent critics I think he was a man named Daniel Tutt say we have a very nice online community um and this is disturbing it and I thought that it's a brilliant confession cuz basically it sums up everything which is that we have been that they have been allowed to have a nice little Community talking to each other not talking to the working class no threat to the ruling class and they're allowed to have that because the left in the United States and in Britain is allowed to exist as long as it is clamped on to the just the left wing of the Bourgeois it to modern day versions of What marks and Engles referred to as Bourgeois socialism basically you're allow to be that and you can make a nice career for yourself doing that you know and it's there'll be no risk of any any of them facing State repression or raids from the FBI uh because again you can you can you're part of the curated alternative uh in the west and that's the only form of Socialism or Marxism that's actually allowed to exist and they're getting very angry because that's now being exposed because we've been through now we are in now the 16th year since the crisis of 2008 there's people who've grown up into adulthood living their entire life in the shadow of this crisis people turned in your country in mind to reformism in the form of Sanders in the form of Corbin they turned to um more openly or avowedly reactionary forces in the form of Donald Trump or in the form of like people like Nigel farage all of which were found to be inadequate all of which were found to be wanting and slowly the worker is being compelled to face the reality of his or her conditions of life which is that if this continues only IM miseration awaits and you was saying that the the American worker knows a lot of this already so like the the working class know very well that the political systems a scam they might not have all the um correct Theory and understanding as to exactly why it is but they know it's a scam that's why only one in five people actually voted for this uh government that we've got right now record low turnout it's why there will be like what almost half the electorate won't vote in a presidential election going back many many years it's why almost no as you said nobody trusts the institutions again they the worker doesn't really know the reasons why a lot of the time but they understand that it's not for them and to go back to what you was you mentioned um Lincoln uh I believe it was in his his second inauguration address that he denounced wage labor as like the next yeah it was in one of those yeah is the next big evil where he goes on this extended um sermon about the uh we have about doing away with slave labor and like waged labor was almost as offensive and I thought Jesus it's no wonder they shot him you know labor is prior to and Superior to Capital the interest of I mean he was and he was his administ um was in contact with Marx through the first International and and that view that Lincoln had wasn't like exclusive to Lincoln there was people like Frederick Douglas that after uh um the victory over the planter class in the US South said okay now that we have seen wage slavery for a few years it's a monster of its own that has to be concrete yeah exactly and it's this is this is this is part of the um as you we last time you were on we were discussing your book about American Marxism and you you argued in there that this is all part of like American traditions like this is all it's is all there in the traditions of the United States it's actually there in the traditions of each Nation even our own the oldest the oldest imperialist country in the world you can go and find an alternative tradition a proletarian tradition uh that sees the nation in an entirely different way to the to the to the domination and control methods of the of the ruling class and the other point I wanted to to raise was just to go back to the point about um the the way in which workingclass politics has been actively suppressed and that a left the left is a part of that suppression because when I looked at the response to Trump uh the first time around I think now he's pretty much under control but the first time around like I thought such a key part of the reason why there was so much hysteria about him was because he did make that appeal to the American worker hypocritically yes um with no chance of ever achieving his program yes but even the act of saying the elite suck I'm on your side even that was enough to send like a huge section of the American ruling class and their intellectual flunkies into like a a paroxismo because suddenly like the the the the working class even in a distorted way was being called upon to do something even by this like scumbag New York property developer billionaire or fake billionaire and even even just that small thing was enough to send them running for the hills in fear and I think that's thing that's the thing that so many people missed it's that it's any role of for the working class that doesn't involve either complete submission or being reduced to to begging for crumb anything that's not that terrifies the the Bourgeois liberals and their leftist hangers on and that is I think a realization that we must learn from given that that is something that the leftists have helped perpetuate basically morbid fear of the masses in the United States actually mobilizing in a serious way what do you what do you what do you say to that interpretation that I've given there about the the Trump phenomenon no absolutely absolutely in terms of the left I developed the concept in the Purity fetish and and also in the book from this year why we need American Marxism that what the left functions here in the US as is as a controlled form of counter hyic so it presents itself as counter hedonic so against the ruling ideas but it's actually not it's actually not only neutrally not opposing the hegemonic forces of uh the state and capital but it serves an essential role an essential function for that what they do is recuperate the S these dissenting attitudes that periodically develop in people and sort of fold them back into a pro system fold or into organizations that are never going to to accomplish uh anything at all and you know it's interesting you you brought up T there was another person as well acatar bear and we have interviewed like we interviewed like four years ago at the Institute he got really popular for defending Stalin and uh he went on a few shows massive shows um defending Stalin I think one of them was like Fox News or something um I can't recall but he he came out and said something akin to we have a great leftist community and here comes ACP to tarnish it um and uh you know you know what it is it's like it's stoski it's ISM with Stalin's face that's what it is and that's why it's confused so many people because in terms of the trosy Stalin divide they claim to be Pro Stalin anti-ros but in actuality they're just trites which are the compatible left par Excellence you know it's been the left that has been useful for imperialism from the start and therefore you know we can question whether it's even worth being called the left if it sides with the the forces of reaction so that's what I see a whole lot of in the US and it's a relatively I think recent phenomenon here where a lot of people will hold up the right figures but then in actuality in terms of their real actions on the class struggle unfolding in their own countries they act like the figures that the figures that they uphold would have you know either eliminated or put in a goog rightfully so so yeah well they they hold them up and not as living um not as living um legacies but as essentially Dead images yes as um as things which are meant to be um thoughtlessly worshiped in a way that would have disgusted all of the men involved let's just be absolutely clear just as most of the people who call themselves luxembourgers would have disgusted Rosa Luxembourg um like the the what they a lot of them do is they take that the vision of Stalin presented by the Bourgeois and say oh yeah but that's good that's based you know we like that whereas in actual fact like you can guarantee that most of them haven't actually studied Stalin's work which everybody should because there's a real richness to that there's a development of Marxism leninism in there which is completely neglected and also largely unavailable except through like specialist uh communist communist aligned bookstores and it's it's I find it unsurprising uring that you can you can go into a High Street Bookstore you can buy mine Camp fact that they're overflowing with them and books about Hitler but the books of Stalin are I would say deliberately suppressed books of Mau as well um Snider or something yeah Timothy SN with Lenin with a 100 page introduction by Timothy Snider you know um which they did try here for a while but they even stopped publishing like most of Lenin's work and like it's deliberate because you read you go and read Stalin in the debates with um trosky in the opposition say in the 1920s and what you will find there is well a lot of things but two things immediately jump out at you one is a man who's constantly involved in testing the theory with the practice uh and learning from it and being open about the learning process all the way through the New Economic Policy learning from what works and what doesn't and openly debating that in the Bolshevik or the the cpsu as it became and then actually having the debates out in the open that are published in Pravda with trosky with zinovev and the others and and publicly rebuking them basically for getting things wrong but also saying and we as a party periodically got things wrong our approach to the peasantry needed to change our approach to um how to solidify the alliance between the urban workers and the peasantry needed to constantly evolve and and once you read that you discover that the the the real Stalin is something which is completely different to the the Dead image held up by the internet Fanboys and the demon presented by the uh by the paid academics and the the fake historians but again like the as you say the the Western left is its purpose is to not do any of th that work but to reduce everything to um dead icons to be screamed over basically and you can make a name for yourself being the chief screamer about the about Stalin as this guy acatar bear was but actually learning from Stalin no forbidden can't do that actually trying to apply some of the real lessons of when when Stalin reflects upon well how was the dictatorship of the proletarian actually built and maintained what went into it what was its content oh no you can't learn that you can't look at that you know that's forbidden um because again that takes you in the direction of being serious about things and I think it's no coincidence that the ACP has been greed with such hysteria because the ruling class's actual hegemony in the United States especially um now and its ideological hegemony over the working class is visibly shaking away you've got the the ruling class producing joke politicians you've got them producing you got them producing like garbage culture which is progressively being rejected by more and more workers um which is why they employ leftists to scream that if you don't like the latest Marvel products you must be a racist um but you got a systemic crisis there which um you as the ACP step into the middle of in in in your foundations and so it's no coincidence that they deploy the left to attack you and that the the the system is increasingly growing increasingly repressive and hysterical towards any mild form of dissent because it just can't handle it anymore there's no scope for reform they know that so any attempt at change has to be repressed beaten down terrified into submission and that's what's going on across all of the imperialist countries now it's why people get arrested for tweeting about the genocide in occupied Palestine because they don't intend to change their policy so their only response is well we'll lock people up if they raise too many questions about it but final point to draw us to the the to the the conclusion here Carlos which is that the the the call for the the establishment of uh working class rule is like the the core of Communism as I and I think yourself understand it and the that is something which we try and emphasize here all the time because socialism to too many workers has come to mean like the the failed welfare capitalist projects of the postwar era and it it actually enabled the Bourgeois right- Wingers to steal a march by by proclaiming themselves to be in favor of you know the radical autonomy of the working class the worker doesn't want to hand out will'll be the real uh Workers Party that kind of thing Trump's still doing it today but I think that the the emphasis that we should put on things is that we don't want to be a layer in society which should ministers you know crumbs to the workers the the working class's historic Destiny is to take control of the nation and to be the be the the the class that will truly rule the nation and remake it in its image and I think that is something which hasn't been talked about even in communist parties for so long and it's something that I think we should we should Hammer home the point every chance we get but what I wanted to get your thoughts on that before we close out and people I mean we we we tend to accept the Lexicon with which the ruling class talks about these things where like people will be more attentive to thing the things that are most moderate right that's the general assumptions that people operate with um but is it true you know is is is it true and I remember this uh this experience that I had when I was organizing uh with the Bernie Sanders campaign um and at that point I identified as a as a Marxist leninist um and I would talk to people especially the people from workingclass backgrounds or farmers they weren't very receptive to Bernie Sanders because for them it felt like handouts right you know just having the state do more for me but when I started scrapping the Bernie campaign narrative and just going you know full communist mode um and talking about no no no it's about power like are you going to continue letting the boss you or are you going to own up to uh your historic Destiny and control the things that you already work in and when you start speaking in those terms in terms of socialism as not more taxes that the rich pay to fund uh social programs or whatever but who is going to control Society is it going to be you workingclass people or is it going to be the the parasites are controlling it now that narrative is much uh easier to accept for workingclass people then that traditional Social Democratic uh bunk that they do genuinely at least in the US they interpret it as hands out as handouts and you know not to say that having you know social welfare programs are wrong socialist countries have good welfare programs but um the welfare how it functions in the US it's that the vast majority of the working class has to participate in it because they can't survive because they're not paid enough so the state has to supplement them but where do do those funds come from they come from workingclass people who pay the taxes to half go to war and half pay for what the capitalist didn't pay in wages and house now become a responsibility of the state to account for the inability that people have to survive so I mean it's it's not I don't like the language of handouts but there is something to the fact that it is the state through the taxes of the people that are paying for some of these uh things because the capitalist didn't pay them enough um because of other factors inflation Etc but you know you mentioned um you know the role of leftist and we had an incident recently I wonder if if you saw it but one of our comrades in Carbondale which is where I lived for like five years that's where I did my masters in BHD uh one of our comrades in Carbondale Emory along with the other comrades in Carbondale had been Distributing for months um uh medical uh supplies for this outbreak of Lyme disease that existed in gbondo it's a place where most of what there is to do is hike and the hiking areas are filled filled with ticks so they were Distributing these things doing community service cleaning up uh communities and doing amazing work well this comrade Emory gets approached a week and a half ago by a 66 trans individual named Cassandra at a Casey's gas station who starts to harass him and takes him outside and Records him uh and calls him a fascist and and says that the ACP hat that he was wearing was the equivalent of a Nazi um of a Nazi swasa okay and then Cassandra's uh partner and the weirdest voice I've ever heard on a Cassandra very deep voice um Sandra's partner goes ahead on Facebook and mentions in the comments that uh that we should be killed or something like that so Alex let me ask you a question what group historically in the periods of crisis of capital were the ones that through extra legal means approached the Communists and terrorized them or uh threatened to terrorize them as some of the leftists are doing to us it's been the fascist the fascists have been the henchmen of fin Capital throughout their whole lives that's what fascism is par excellence and that's the role that the left in part especially the most extreme woke parts of it plays in the US well there wasn't a joke when Stalin said that social democracy is objectively the moderate wing of fascism but it doesn't sound like uh Cassandra or whatever his real name is uh is um really um is should probably read that and took it to heart and said yes yes we are um but there's a serious point a very serious point in what you're getting what happened to your comrades there and also like the the role of social democracy which is that it is a real distinction between communism and social democracy that goes back a long way um probably to the days of well arguably to the days of the 1840s from the from the writing of the manifesto itself but certainly since the split in the second International that you have the Communists who are as we've been disc discussing um whose Center of activity who whose driving purpose is to overcome this system to have our class become the ruling class to start the process start that long struggle towards a classless society in the in in maybe the far future in several Generations away and that is a fundamentally different Vision to that which is held by the Social Democrat the Social Democrat even on the left even the left versions of the Social Democrat sees the working class as at best something that they push onto the stage periodically and then you pushed off the stage again and the Social Democrat the bureaucrat the technocrat get down to the business of bargaining with the employers that's that's what social democracy really is and in Britain we're the probably the the the absolute masters of it because our labor party was never even pretended to be Marxist it was always that Coalition of petty Bourgeois intellectuals and Trade union bureaucrats uh coming together to what as they saw it do a decent thing every now and again for the working class and it is those people who in the 20s and 30s were objectively speaking siding with fascism um and as the decade wore on in the 30s started to more and more openly side with fascism like there's plenty of examples of social Democrats just going straight over to the Nazis um people who'd been active in the social democracy going straight over to national socialism because really wasn't all that much different but Difference by that stage in the in the foundation of the people's democracies like places like Hungary and Poland many social Democrats of course um joined the process of building the people's democracies the leaders though largely sided with capital sided with the the uh people like the horites in Hungary and tried frantically to derail the process of the the building of the uh the people's democracies and the the people's anti-fascist government that's that were brought in or came in after the war and a lot of them ended up living in Exile in Britain or the United States collaborating with imperialism and being in Alliance with Fascism and that's not an accident and so for some lunatic to decide that he's going to go and threatened to kill somebody for you know doing actual community service and actually daring to try to get to try to get back to what communism should be in both theory and practice actually isn't a surprise and if you look at the uh very long history of these let's just say unstable individuals in all countries but especially the imperialist centers being recruited by various different police agencies as in performance as double agents and as as assets again not a surprise the the established left is riddled with these people the state promotes them in various different ways they make sure that if we're talking the online world that they get big platforms and they get a big audience because the algorithm pushes people towards them that's what bread tube was um there's people who I've never seen one video I've never seen majority report in my life it's in the suggested videos to watch all the  time I don't I don't get it but you're absolutely I mean even look at the foundations of fascism as something explicitly sort of self-conscious of itself as fascist and musolini where does he come out of these same Social Democratic spaces and the role that fascism plays as a form of governance that can attempt to manage the contradictions of capitalism and crisis in a way as stalinist position uh upholds that's the same thing the social Democrats try to do in a perhaps different form but it's absolutely the same thing they're the ones that try to manage the contradictions that make themselves heightened in those periods of Crisis and it's very visible right now in the US because our biggest haters are coming from two directions the leftist that are threatening to kill us a lot of them it wasn't just a Cassandra individual whole lot of them um there was one a while back that put a a picture of a scope and within the scope it was like the infrared logo the Midwest and marks logo and the the ACP um and this was an individual with like 14,000 subscribers on Twitch or something the leftist and the other group which is now being promoted by uh X are the gers the literal like Nazi and and and and racist like uh Nick Fuentes oh yeah and these groups are starting to organize themselves they have gone out and doxed quite a few of our members and party leaderships and their families and partners and we have taken them head on while the leftists have said no we don't even want to debate with them let them continue to reach disaffected young men we have taken them headon and because we take them headon the leftist call us fascist the the the the self-proclaimed fascist call us Jewish or uh brown or whatever stupid thing they call us and I think that you know that's the good stalinist Marxist leninist golden Center when you're getting attacked by all the right people I think you might be doing something right well yes and exactly and it's no surprise that the ruling class will in in the United States would be now actively pushing disaffected pissed off younger guys in particular towards open fascism because there's some in the ring class who have already reached the conclusion is that's the only way they're going to be able to save themselves so get those guys ready whether it's a clown like Nick Fuentes or somebody else or probably somebody a bit more serious in the end but they want them there as the reserve Force if they need them because they know that there are big class struggles to come in the United States because the the crisis of 2008 never ended it is only getting worse and the crisis for all of the imperialist countries is going to renew itself especially when I think two things if two things happen in the next year which probably I think it's a fair bet will occur one the def final defeat of the NATO operation in Ukraine which is coming and two whatever outcome does emerge which will not be favorable to Israel in U West Asia that will be devastating for us imperialism British imperialism French imperialism in that region it will end the Hundred Years of domination over those peoples um that began after the implosion of the Ottoman Empire and that will be a huge blow to the US ruling class in particular and to the British and that will push them into a a massive crisis and so it is I think a very positive thing that the the American Communist party is out there establishing yourselves now with I think the right attitude in terms of going into the masses being amongst them and establishing the party as a trusted uh a trusted voice and a trusted face in those communities and the st's aware of that and therefore you're attracting the right enemies as a result as the state starts throwing things at you to try and essentially knock the party off its stride as early as possible so I think it's um it's a crucial time to be a communist anywhere in the world but I think especially in this period of great change when the imperialist powers that have defined the last three centuries are finding the Inc all coming to a close we don't know where the struggle's going to go but I think I feel at least there are enough of us now to start to push it in the right direction but I'll leave the final word in the discussion to yourself comrade well I couldn't agree more uh with everything you said and um the repression is coming from all angles from the state itself I mean our people can't leave the country without getting harassed when they come back by Customs their phones copied interrogated for two three four hours um you know we've had members receive documents from from uh you know States uh inquiring as to their activities with the ACP and it's the the repression is ramping up um and it is and there's a lot of stuff that can't be set on air but um it's uh the only thing that I'm really glad about is that the leadership of the party and what I saw in the eyes of the membership the Cadre at our national Convention is that these are people that are serious about what's what's being done here what's being built uh they're not doing it as a social club for fun to elevate their status and Prestige these are people that are willing to give their lives to the struggle um and that's the sort of character I think we need um because you're not going to beat an imperialist parasitic monster machine like the US capitalist system without an attitude that is ready to put everything on the line for the advancement of the class struggle and um you know one of the things that that also sets us apart from other left as organization is that we emphasize character we need to have you know some sort of a communist virtue ethic we need to be honorable people we need to be courageous um that's something that Aristotle used to say you can have every virtue but if you don't have courage they're all meaningless when has the left talked about courage having sin War like courage I mean you that's that's What communists need That's What communists are known for historically so um I I know uh the part's ready uh for for anything that that that comes towards us to adjust and keep moving forward irrespective of how hard uh hits uh we get but uh as far as plugging anything I'm I'm currently um I'm opening up the signups to a class on Marxism leninism it's a 16-week seminar uh people can now sign up for the first eight weeks it's a you know the low affordable Midwestern marks Institute prices that we usually put out and people get the recording so if you're in WR and the time difference makes it so that you can't uh be there for too long you could still watch the recording and keep it you know for eternity um we also I also just recently published a book this year called why we need American Marxism that develops on some of the themes of the last time we spoke the book that we spoke about which was the the Purity fetish and that um you know thinks about what would the unique adaptation of Marxism leninism to an American context look like in a way almost homologous to like cified Marxism leninism in China or something like that so um you can check all of that out um at the Midwest marks website at Midwest marks.com and as far as signing up for the class uh we're going to pin it to our Twitter which is just Midwestern marks I haven't pinned it by the time you watch the interview it will be pinned to the Twitter so you can check that out there but thank you so much for having me on Alex it's always a pleasure to talk to you and I've I've really enjoyed this opportunity always an interesting discussion Carlos thank you for coming on today and uh that was uh the last hour we've been talking to Carlos gito of the American Communist party and Midwestern marks be sure to check out all the details he mentioned just there and I only remains for me to say good luck in the in the struggles to come comrade I think we'll both need it yes likewise thank you all right
