hi everyone and welcome back to the probably canceled podcast my name is Bridget and I'm your host and today I am here with the great Don quarter of the Revolution report hello and how are you doing today Don good good uh I'm happy that uh you invited me onto the program and uh that we finally had a time had a chance do the podcast together because I mean we met a long time ago but uh kind of have been in separate spheres since then especially with me going to Russia yeah it seems like you've been very very busy and well Don is here today to talk about his recent trip to the dprk AKA North Korea and Vietnam along with the Russian government is that correct yeah yeah was with with the Russian delegation and Vladimir Putin I work in the presidential media pool as a journalist so I I usually go on trips like this that's crazy so just to start off can you talk a little bit about your background like how did you I've I've been meaning to ask you this how did you even find yourself in this line of work and then talk a little bit about the work that you do yeah well it is really a bit funny even U my parents still laugh about it all the time they're like some guy from New Jersey is in the Russian presidential media pool I I grew up in East Brunswick New Jersey uh my my parents are not Russian and they come from like a humble working class background and uh when I started getting into communism and uh you know Anti-Imperialist politics and everything around 13 started reading more about marks and Lenin and and Stalin and the whole communist World politics philosophy all that stuff um then I decided when I got into University I went to ruter and also in New Jersey that uh I wanted to study history with a focus on Soviet history obviously and uh Russian language and literature so that I could read uh about the history of the Soviet Union from Russian sources that were not available in English because one of the big problems obviously with the um what what we have available to us in understanding the cold war is that pretty much everything that's in English well at least the vast majority of it uh is uh what what the western side of the Cold War wants us to know about about the Cold War right I mean the Soviet Union had progress Publishers which published some stuff in English but uh there's there's huge amounts of information only available in Russian that gives a really different perspective on the Soviet Union so for me that was really fascinating and I wanted to learn Russian so I could study that myself um I finished University thought what am I going to do with uh a Russian language and history degree and I decided to I just wanted to go to Russia to have a bit of an adventure to experience the culture myself I didn't really have any sort of long-term uh plan I just thought let's see what happens you know and I worked as an English teacher there for three months I didn't really like it I'm not I'm not really I don't like working with kids although I love kids just I don't want to teach them and uh uh after three months I started looking for new work and I had a friend in RT and they said they needed a um a new correspondent for The English Department obviously I'd always been into politics and contemporary events and everything so out of all the things that I could do with my interests and everything I thought journalism could be could be one of them and it was the right decision because six years later six and a half years later here I am still doing this I'm like I'm one of the top correspondents in the English Department it's become my life and uh it was a good decision it's even better than history really it's it's a history that's happening right now so I really love journalism and uh I also when I have free time dabble in philosophy and uh and economics and stuff like that but journalism of course is my my profession so that's so cool and your Russian is actually really good I've heard you interview people in Russian I was like how do is he is he literally Russian was he raised speaking Russian so it's good to know now I know your background that makes a lot more sense but communist at 13 that's pretty early dude yeah I mean it's when I started thinking about the world critically I guess I mean it was one the 2008 financial crisis happened so I was like my my world went from everything being fine to seeing my neighbors losing their houses and stuff and I was like why is that so I started reading about you know stuff like that wow that's amazing okay such a fascinating story um so just moving on could you give us a little bit of a debrief on your recent trip to North Korea and Vietnam yeah so um first of all when I heard that uh Vladimir Putin was going to V to to North Korea and uh I was going to be able to go with him I was like wow this is awesome I I wanted to go to North Korea for the longest time I think you could say it's even like a a a childhood dream of mine because it's just a country that I guess when the leaders of the West tell us that oh bad bad bad it's the it's hell on Earth don't go there blah blah blah it makes you want to go even more at least for me I want I wanted to see like what it was like there it's such a unique place the culture the uh the society the political system the economic system everything is very very unique there and um I was always fascinated also with how that country despite so much pressure over the years despite a devastating war in the 1950s despite constantly being threatened with nuclear Annihilation by the US actually uh that country continues to exist and and lives on in the way that it it feels necessary it needs to live its own National Life you know and so for me that was like really impressive so um I always wanted to go there and it was a really unique experience going there for the first time with this Russian delegation because this was this is basically one of the most important uh visits from a foreign delegation to the dprk in the in the history of the country really I kind of welcome that they gave and the sort of pres preparations that were made for the Russian delegation it's on a scale that we haven't seen since the 1970s when uh when the then Romanian president Nikolai chesu went to the dprk and they also had the whole city come out and decorate the entire city and do um uh like organized um how would you say it like mass mass parades and you know the waving and making giant uh posters with millions of people and stuff like that uh so they did the same thing for Vladimir Putin at this uh this time I mean they had the main square of the the capital completely decked out and decorated Vladimir Putin was all over the place uh signs in Korean and Russian saying welcome Russian Uh Russian delegation welcome Vladimir Putin uh Korean Russian friendship and everything and when we got to the square also tens of thousands of people there you know like uh in in this ceremony music Soldiers the whole government met Vladimir Putin it was really cool that I got to be there on kimil song Square for that historic event and it really was historic not just because um Vladimir Putin was going there with his delegation which by the way you know Vladimir Putin wasn't the only highlevel guy in this delegation I mean it was the foreign minister Sergey lavro the defense minister was there uh Bell of and all these other very top level dep Russian deputies and diplomats uh but it's not like I said it's not only important and historic because Russians visited this place I mean they signed um an update to their previous comprehensive agreement on strategic partnership that was signed in the early 2000s this is the first time in nearly a quarter of of a century that Vladimir Putin has gone to the dprk and they signed an updated version of this agreement which essentially and and this is like the way I see it obviously the official title for this agreement is a comprehensive agreement on strategic partnership but based on what it actually says I think it looks like an alliance or or or Mutual defense pack because essentially the updated agreement that they signed When Vladimir Putin visited the dprk this time uh makes it so that both parties are bound to defend the other in the case of military aggression against against one of them so say South Korea decides to you know the hypothetical situation attack the dprk tomorrow militarily Russia's Bound by this agreement to go help them uh at the very least with like massive weapons deliveries at the very most to like putting boots on the ground and uh obviously the big question that this um puts forward is the Ukraine conflict because Russia is currently experiencing aggression from NATO and the United States so it makes so according to the um principles of this agreement theoretically within that framework North Korea would have the the right the Diplomatic right to send troops there and fight alongside the Russian military or at the very least to send you know um Munitions or equipment for the war effort so that kind of formalizes this uh this possibility and there have even been some reports that North Korea is planning to send troops there uh but that has not been confirmed and also I was at a press conference that Vladimir Putin spoke at um and we got to ask him questions and one of my colleagues asked him a question about that does this mean there are going to be North Korean troops in in in Ukraine he said that's really unlikely because uh even before this agreement was signed he said they they were more than welcome to send volunteers or anything like that and North Korea hasn't showed interest in doing that so um that's not really uh something that's likely to happen according to the Russian president what what he said at the press conference but uh what I think the main the main reason why Russia decided to uh sign this agreement with the dprk is because uh because of the fact that Western sanctions have isolated both the DP well have attempted to isolate the dprk in Russia because they haven't really been successful they've just been isolated from the West which They Don't Really they don't really care about it's not most most of the world um because they' both basically Fallen under the same sanctions regimes Russia's now I don't know if you know but the most sanctioned country in the world uh because because they both fall under the same sanction reg regime they have much more of a common enemy than they used to and uh another thing is that the United States basically is uh sending long-range weapons to Ukraine right that's not news but what the the news is that recently they've given them the ukrainians the green light to use them uh deep within Russian territory and not only that but the but these uh us long range missiles that are being used by the Ukrainian military are being Guided by us Specialists and they're being guided using us intelligence and US satellite intelligence as well so for example the um the tragedy that happened in sevastopol uh this week in which four people four civilians died and 150 were injured two of the people who were killed were children uh that that was that was an American missile that struck a beach where there was no military infrastructure where people were just chilling out and uh that was a missile that was an American missile attacks it's called and it was Guided by us Specialists on using American intelligence so this uh intensification this provocation from the United States side is what is basically uh having Russia start to adapt a policy of uh signing the agreements with countries that are against the us so that they can theoretically you know uh arm them with weapons right because now the the dprk um has nuclear weapons obviously but as far as I understand the radius of that they can reach is only to California but with this agreement right theoretically Russia could arm them with longrange nuclear missiles that could Inc that could hit any part of the United States which is something that the US really doesn't want which is you know a reason why this agreement is a retaliation to the US arming Ukraine and helping them kill civilians on Russian territory you know that's a huge provocation I mean could you imagine if uh Isis you know launched a missile managed to launch a missile at Miami Beach and Washington found out that Russia gave them the missile and helped them fire that would be absurd like that would you know in any conceivable situation that would be a declaration of war essentially um so that's why this agreement is so significant in the context of the current conflict and in the context of um the tightening of cooperation between different countries of the multi-polar world you know and it just goes into the fact that um they would have never signed this agreement if it wasn't for the West if it wasn't for the uh the West sponsoring the Kiev government and sanctioning these countries so much they would have no reason to to sign agreements that Bas basically amount to Mutual defense PS uh but now they have a common enemy so it it it's like Western policies are boomeranging uh back onto themselves and actually uniting the people that they consider to be their enemies and creating a united front against uh Western imperialism so that was uh really the significance of this document um it was really I got I was in the room with Kim Jong-un and Vladimir Putin when they gave the statement after the signing of the documents so I got to see Kim Jong-un in person it's pretty cool um and they were very hospitable the the North Koreans I mean they you know they get a bad rap because in the west all we hear about is how they treat Western journalists and Western tourists but I think the reality of it is that they're treated that way because in the past they've gone to the country and taken advantage of their of the fact that the the North Korean government has been welcoming to them and they go back and make super anti-north Korean propaganda about the country uh and I think this is why Western journalists you know get their cameras uh CA their cameras checked uh to make sure they don't have anything potentially considered disrespectful or they're told what they can and can't film because I went with the Russian delegation we weren't told anything like that I even asked at the very beginning I was like all right what is okay to film what's not let's get this out the way they're like film whatever you want they didn't even they didn't even check to see if on my camera I had pictures of half of kimil song's face or something you know they didn't didn't even bother to ask they were like ask us any questions you want anything you want to film is fine um I wish I had some time for interviews with North Koreans because even some PE some people from other Russian government channels when we were on the move to the media area they even got like small interviews like two second interviews just with some of the North Koreans on the Square that could speak English so it's like it it was completely in contradiction to the kind of propaganda we see in regard with regard to that we had complete freedom to do whatever we wanted um so that was really cool um our guides were super friendly super cool told us a lot about uh anything we wanted to know really I mean it's it's it's because of them that I understand that this is this has been pretty much the most uh important welcoming ceremony since the time of Nikolai chesu that was something our our guides mentioned I looked it up it's true um you know they uh we talked about different stuff about like uh our different cultures right I find it interesting that they have a they have their own calendar in the dprk they have their calendars have like our actual years and everything but but next to it it's got like the North Korean uh counting of the years and year one is is the year of their Revolution actually so I think this year and the calendar is like one one year 133 um but it's like alongside the calendar that everyone else use uses so it's just kind of like a aspect of their culture but uh yeah the hotel was nice and really they did everything to um to make sure that our stay was well and we accomplished our objectives as journalists trying to cover this event so it was really cool that's so amazing that you got to go to such a historic meeting and it's really beautiful to see I was excited to see all the video and pictures from the event and I'm I'm just really happy to see Russia strengthening uh ties with China and North Korea and do you think that there's any possibility that dprk would be joining bricks in the future uh I don't think so because um the the dprk like a lot of times economics is they they they look at economics separate from these political diplomatic deals and the bricks itself you know uh declares that it's not a sort of um partisan organization it's supposed it's just a you know an economic block of anyone who wants to join to try to get away from um dollar hegemony right but because I think this is my opinion I mean I haven't spoken to uh or done any Research into this but I think based on the dprk's ju ideology of self iance in the economy I think uh they're probably going to not do that just because it requires more economic integration right it's like you said it's good to see Russia China and the dprk uh working together more but like China and the dprk are really different uh case studies I would say in socialism right like China's embraced opening up and the dprk has uh sort of stuck to being closed and you know there positives and negatives to both of those approaches but based on what I saw in pongyang I mean the dprk seems to be doing fine going its own path you know um but I think it would of course help if they became part of brics because obviously they every country like that has a problem with hard currencies and uh even though the dprk is like a Super Hyper independent country they still do have to do some foreign trade which is why um you know payments that we everything we bought in the dprk was done with dollars uh because that's how they get uh you know hard currency to do the trade that they need to do abroad but I think joining brics and strengthening the possibility of like um a brics currency alternative or doing um transactions in National currencies would would help their situation actually yeah I I think so too but I'm also not an economist but I think so too I would love to see that and question I wanted to ask you was you touched on it a little bit but how was your experience in comparison to what like uh Western media tabloids like to report about North Korea or somebody as popular as Yoni Park likes to report about North Korea how did that compare to the reality of being there well I mean first of all I I know a lot about Yoni park because uh I did a dprk miniseries on my on my channel the revolution report and uh I've just I I know how like just how much of her just how many of her stories don't add up and they contradict each other so I really wouldn't trust anything that she says especially because it's not backed up by any evidence either I mean in the first episode of our our dprk miniseries like and this didn't take me too long to find I found a video of her of her crying when she was giving a like a speech and she was like North Korea is so horrible they only have one channel on TV and first of all even that's not true they have like four but still it's like that's the worst thing you got to talk about but anyway um I I like I would not trust anything about these about like prisons or any of these horror stories that these people say because none of it's backed up by evidence like the evidence that were told were shown is like some satellite image right the the famous satellite image of the alleged North Korean concentration camp but that's just an image of a camp we don't even know what that's for and until there's like some some actual evidence some photography or video or some sort of actual firm evidence about about s those those kinds of Human Rights abuses that that North Korea is being accused of I'm not going to believe it I mean this is the same thing that uh I mean I mean you know people might think how could you you know like uh question people who are coming out with all this horrible stuff blah blah blah but you really got to think about it and wait for evidence to come forward because let we can go back to what happened in Iraq I mean the I mean they had a a young girl testifying in front of the world saying accusing Saddam Hussein of all of Saddam Hussein's government of all these horrible uh crimes and they ended up being not true and they only found out after uh the fall of the Saddam Hussein government that they had a lie I mean same thing with the uh weapons of mass destruction C there were none and yet colen Powell was showing the white powder that was just whatever sugar or something like what whatever this they literally construe lies to overthrow governments like this and this would this definitely would not be the first time at all I mean the these people even get paid you know the Yoni Park is paid well also to make up these stories but so uh what I would say about it Con conflicting with my experience there I mean there were not starving people people right I mean they of course there Pyongyang so the people who accuse North Korea of having starving people everywhere would say oh it's the capital blah blah blah but this this starvation stuff is from like 25 years ago I mean and North Korea doesn't deny that that happened they call it the arduous March in its period of history but that's old news that's like thinking that's like the same thing as people say that Beijing is like a completely polluted city that's old news that's from like 2008 Beijing is a super clean modern place now they fix those problems and same thing in the dprk people are not starving there there's actually and you know I live in Moscow where there there's there's obviously in Moscow lots of modern buildings and everything but there's also a lot of uh buildings from like the 70s from the Soviet Union they were built to last and people still live in them and they're still fine you know but uh I expected to see more of these older buildings in pongyang but actually new buildings have sprung up all over the place and uh like our like I I posted that video it went viral it got like a million views on Twitter uh talking about what the guides were had told us that you know all these new buildings all these new apartment buildings had sprung up uh around around Pyongyang as of recently and they're provided for free to the people of Pyongyang I mean I the first thing I thought was like wow how many people do I know that are struggling to pay rent in New York or New Jersey to buy some piece of crap house you know that's super old and they spend their entire lives to uh to pay their mortgage and here is like the capital of the country and they're building in in in a country that's like considered by the West to be just an underdeveloped hellhole right and and yet the country has money to be making new apartment buildings and giving them out to free for the people and you know I got tons of comments on this tweet from people that are like oh they're they're fake buildings there's nobody living in them you notice there's no cars on the road I didn't I didn't reply to any of these because there were tons of people replying to this TW this tweet but I I'll address these arguments now first of all the reason why there were no cars on the road was because the government planned the route of the presidential Administration to the hotel in advance it's like completely standard procedure for a country expecting a foreign delegation to clear the road before before they get there that's why there were no cars on the road I mean unless it's an over overpopulated place like in Jakarta they weren't able to do that but yet still there's a police escort right but in the dprk they cleared the road it's completely normal because when we got to the hotel I saw cars and trams on the road and buses and stuff um there were people in the buildings because I saw them they're just obviously not visible from the quick video I made on the on the the bus you know um all this stuff is just literally conspiracy theories you know like these people really think that that North Korea is is like building all these huge modern apartment buildings so they can impress tourists and foreigners when they come to the country like what the heck is is the country so rich that it has enough resources to do that or is it a hell hole like what's which one is it it's it's really funny I mean they're uh so that I mean that's that's the the impression I got from the country it's nothing like um what western propaganda says about it first of all because most of the propaganda is old uh and if you want to see the countryside of the dprk there's videos on YouTube of that they don't they're they're not in disarray either obviously Pyongyang is going to be the best it's the capital of the country but um and in terms of uh something about Western propaganda I wanted to also say um just basically the the perception of uh what we're told in the west and what what actually is there based on what I saw is completely just night and day right and it it makes it makes sense because they're trying to just demonize the country in any way possible and one thing I I say in my dprk miniseries actually is that the way most people in America um Envision North Korea is actually the way America relates to North Korea I mean you they'll they'll be like the media is entirely controlled they only have one narrative they're brainwashed but if you talk to 99% of Americans they'll tell you exactly the same thing and they'll and they'll think that they came to that conclusion themselves but they have been manipulated by the main by the mass media and that's the irony of it what they're they're the ones that are actually living under this like North Korea style regime that they Envision is in North Korea and the last thing I wanted to say I remembered now is uh that uh the dprk has gone under serious reforms under Kim Jong-un actually uh both economic and political and the party has been reformed to work much more effectively than it used to uh all these apartment buildings are propping up under the initiative of Kim Jong-un uh he he's one of his main uh claims to fame is the expansion of of uh good housing for the country uh so really and based on what I've read about him also about Kim Jon you know he he studied in Switzerland with Western people he studied in the west and uh based and there's actually accounts of people who studied with him and were his friends in school or just normal westerners like Swiss people and Europeans and they say he was like super chill cool guy and that's really that's really like the kind of uh the kind of um impression I get from him as well he's not some evil dictator he's like a guy trying to make his country better and he's uh I mean based on how he shows up in the media as well you know he's not he's not a serious as Kim Jong-il Kim Jong-il was also always very serious and blah blah blah but Kim Jong-un seems like very much uh friendlier very he's always laughing in front of the camera you know uh and things have been pretty good under under his administration I would say um of course things were difficult under Kim Jong-il because the Soviet Union collapsed and the economy was going through very tough times so you know that administration had its own uh serious things to deal with Kim Jong-un got a bit of uh the the longer end of the stick on that but things are things seem to be going well you know that's good to hear and I'm surprised that Y Park is taken seriously At All by anyone because when you Google her when you Google her name usually Google is the worst search engine to find any kind of truthful truthful information but when you Google y me park the first thing that comes up is this very thorough article detailing how she's a scammer and has changed her origin story like eight different times and has made up all these crazy lies but I guess nobody Googles her or something but um I sometimes I watch the North Korean government's you YouTube channel and they will often post uh video footage of new unveiled developments that they're working on all throughout the country I just watched one a few weeks ago that they had unveiled this huge produce growing like this huge uh Farm essentially but it was like a very high-tech futuristic automated type of farm thing and they made a very big Fanfare of the unveiling because that is really exciting for them it seems like things are on the up and up which is good to hear your report from the ground and uh did you talk to anybody about like their perception of the West yeah I did actually um I spoke with um some of our guides before I get to that though is what you mentioned about the economics I want to I think people your viewers will find it interesting what I have to say about the internet and smartphones and stuff because they have there they have smartphones in North Korea actually and the internet is available in uh like specific hotels and areas I'm not sure if that's only available to specific uh party functionaries or if that's like a sort of internet cafe that people can go to because in Cuba it's like that they have like internet cafes that people can go to and use but they have their own internet which anyone can get all over the country and they have their own smartphones so and they gave us their their North Korean smartphones unfortunately we had to give them back before we came back but to you know to communicate within the country and everything and everyone everyone's got smartphones too they're like uh people on the street are all talking on North Korean smartphones everyone's got computers and stuff you know it's nothing it's not like the Stone Age what I noticed though is that people are much more um you could tell they do little things which is representative representative of I would say how socialist society makes people more sociable uh than than capitalist Society because everyone's got smartphones right but they're not texting they almost never text even though you can do that everyone's always calling each other no like texting is weird to them it's like they have the reverse of like you know gen zers if you call like someone from gen Z they're going to be like uh why you calling me why don't you write to me you know in in North Korea it'd be like the opposite like why are you writing to me why don't you call me I found that funny like the different yeah the different uh social systems has like manifest itself in these ways in these small noticeable ways which I find interesting but um uh going back to your question what what what what was the question again I remember I had a good answer to it did you talk to anybody about their perception of the west or westerners yeah yeah yeah so um so we spoke with the guides in the uh in in our hotel and in our bus that showed us around and everything um you know it's funny because I was with the Russian delegation right and I speak uh like not perfect Russian but Russian that's good enough so that anyone who it's not it's it's not their their first language they're not going to know I'm not Russian um so they all thought obviously I was Russian when I'm speaking Russian with them and everything and we got to know each other and I was you know I'm I was super friendly with them they were super friendly with me and then they would ask what my name is and then when I'd say Donald they'd be like well that that's not a Russian name they're like like who are you like what what's the story there and I would explain that actually I'm I'm from America your arch nemesis but uh they would they all they always laughed they were like uh while you everyone's basically said the same thing they're like you know you there's there's a big difference between the government and the people right is you as an individual believe one thing and the government does other things so even when they found out I was an American they were like super cool with me but it was funny they were all like in shock for like a few seconds but they obviously are very anti-American government and uh but not anti-American people which is Dem demonstrable by uh what what happened in my personal experience right they're tired of being harassed by the US government the US government has been making their lives miserable since the beginning of the the country I mean the Korean war was absolutely horrific it was ju basically just as horrific as the Vietnam War I mean a lot of people don't know that North Korea was um like the industrial center of Korea before um before the the division of the the country into two halves and the US destroyed all of it like completely flattened the entire country they say that for every person in pongyang living in Pyongyang at the time the US dropped two bombs they dropped double the amount of the population in terms of bombs on that City completely leveled it the economy was like was absolutely not functioning after at the End by the end of the war they even used uh chemical and biological weapons as well that a lot of people don't know about and they put the Japanese occupiers that had been torturing uh the Koreans and doing like experimentation on them and just completely colonizing them they the Americans put their collaborators in power in South Korea so the South Korean government was a Japanese collaborationist government and the people who actually fought colonialism in Korea Kim elung and his guillas they're the ones that came to power alongside the other uh Korean Communists uh so and even after that their system was able to build up uh the country's industry so that uh at any rate even after that war North Korea was more in more had more industrial output than the South up until the 1970s where obviously by the 1970s all that American money finally uh allowed South Korea to outpace North Korea in that sense but it's only because the us at the end of World War II had over 60% of the world's wealth you know was like an absolute uh huge amount of money that they could just throw at their allies anywhere I mean but after that I mean people don't really know that throughout the Cold War I mean the US was the one constantly threatening North Korea with nuclear annihilation in the DMZ for a long time the US had placed atomic bomb mines on the Fe On on the on the DMZ so if someone crossed the DMZ and stepped on one of those mines there'd be an atomic explosion um and that and a lot of people also don't know that North Korea actually entered the nuclear nonproliferation pact which would forbid forbid them from having nuclear weapons because another part of the treaty says that nuclear armed States cannot threaten non-nuclear armed States and the US continued to threaten North Korea so then that that's when they backed out of the agreement and even then even then they cut a they cut a deal with the Bill Clinton administration and Clinton said if you guys don't pursue nuclear weapons we're going to give you uh super advanced technology that's going to be able to allow you to produce atomic energy that that you won't be able to use the byproduct for nuclear weapons North Koreans agreed then George W bush came to power and said I'm not going to do that and then only after all that did did the dprk decide to get nuclear weapons you know when you look at it from their perspective you understand why they hate America it's just like Decades of trying to to like negotiate come to some sort of agreement and just having their good faith just like slapped back at them basically yeah it's important to know this history because I feel like a lot of Americans and especially people our age and younger who wer were not around for the Korean War they have no they have no no idea of the Korean war first of all I never learned about that in school I had to teach myself that in my 20s and it's never it was never even mentioned in my history classes in public high school in Florida and I think a lot of people believe that North Korea has always existed as in its current state or something or they don't really think about why it exists in its current state and then they'll read the media and then just believe whatever the media is saying without like we're not really we're not really incentivized to think deeply about North Korea at all at any point in our lives at least I was not until I became a communist and was like oh well if everything they're telling me if everything I learned is fake then this must be too and I had to do my own research on that and I encourage anybody listening who hasn't done that yet to go ahead and do that because there's a whole other side to the story that we're not being told yeah for people who want to read about it I highly suggest this book called uh North Korea another country it's by a guy named Bruce Cummings and uh this this is a great book because it's not written by someone who supports North Korea it's actually written by a liberal who is arguing that the U soft power approach will be able to crush North Korea you know he want he's suggesting a soft power approach to the dprk but the the the argumentation he makes for it is a is actually accidentally a justification for the dprk's whole Narrative of what's happened he's like we cannot use harsh Force against them because we tried for so many years and they're not breaking so he actually accidentally gives like a very detailed uh historically correct explanation for why North Korea is the way it is today so I definitely for any viewers suggest reading that book North Korea another country that's great I'll link that in the descript description to so people can read that I've never read that so I'll be checking that out as well um but do you want to mention anything else about your North Korea trip before we move on to Vietnam um no I think I pretty much uh said it all I mean I had a great time I pack I packed my suitcase full of souvenirs I mean I I I heard that North Korean beer was super tasty and I even packed my packed my suitcase with that a couple of them exploded but I was like was worth it I I got to try very good so if anyone goes to North Korea try the beer that's great that's awesome okay so how was how was the Vietnam trip how's Vietnam Vietnam was awesome too um I I again it's too bad we had so little time to actually see uh the country because I would have really liked to see more of it but uh and also we came literally at the hottest point of the entire year like I even spoke with I even spoke with this this Vietnamese guy who's like the Secret Service their secret service I was like how how do you guys like live through this he's like we don't I'm like dying said he explained that this is that this is the hottest time of the year we were just like sweating so much it looked like we were that we had just gotten out of the pool like and we're all in suits it was super hot but um the Vietnamese president gave uh the delegation also a very warm welcome uh the first first part of the trip was at the presidential Palace and uh they both met to discuss um some new New Deals they made in terms of cooperation a lot of different spheres um I remember if I remember correctly it's it's an in education like both of them are going to have more educational exchange programs between the two countries now Vladimir Putin even visited um uh a bunch of students who were studying Russian at at a Vietnamese University or at Vietnamese universities all around the country and they came to this visit from the Russian president they even got to talk to him ask him questions so I got to see it as a journalist it was really cool a lot of bright bright uh Bright Young students in Vietnam um there were also a lot of uh you know agreements made about uh like economic cooperation um talk about F talking about further integration with the multinational organizations and all that um but obviously in the def in the ter in terms of Defense cooperation the meeting with North Korea was much more historic uh because obviously the US also does business with Vietnam I think uh I think Russia's obviously closer to Vietnam given given the past but uh Vietnam still does have some sort of diplomatic relationship with the US and even they sent the US sent a diplomat to Vietnam right after Vladimir Putin was there I guess because they were they were nervous that they were getting a little too close to Russia but um yeah and the and Vladimir Putin gave a press conference there as well like I said before that I was able to go to um the it was funny the only we got there and our producers like it is we got there at night right and my producer is like it is going to be so Sunny that you're going to die if you don't get a hat like you need to get like a hat that covers like your your whole the whole like your hat your head and your shoulders the first thing I'm thinking is like am I gonna have to get like one of those Vietnamese rice hats I like think I don't really want to I think they'd be kind of racist if I was gonna wear that but um I found the like the the only one that was available that I could get with the little time I had actually was like this Vietnamese this Vietnamese uh nor North Vietnamese army hat from the Vietnam War was sold it was sold as like a souvenir and uh when I was going when I was going through like all these meetings and everything all all of these Vietnamese uh Secret Service guys were like stopping me to take a picture it was really funny but the the mood was really good everyone was uh everyone was there was that was there all the Vietnamese uh people that were there were super happy to uh know that Russia was visiting the country to deepen deepen cooperation between the two countries uh we even got to do lots of interviews with people on the street and it was all it was all very positive so you know Vietnam is is has very warm feelings towards Russia just like the dprk and uh it was good to see that that's great and you know Russia is not a communist country uh but it's nice to see them being open to having ties to so many communist countries and I mean Putin was in the KGB right and there's a famous quote from Nancy Pelosi where she's like he's just a KGB guy you know and liberals have this idea that like Russia still is communist and it still is the Soviet Union which it's not but I did read a statement from Putin I think he he put out a number of statements throughout 2022 and as I was reading them one of them was talking about how he sees the success that China is having with their economic model and he would not be opposed to implementing something similar to that in Russia yeah do you think that there's like a chance of that um happening because that would be pretty incredible I think um the the US sanctions regime is already pushing Russia in that direction to be honest I mean ever since you know R the Russian economy is on fire right now and that is mostly uh State directed activity uh connected to the connected to the the uh the defense industry and so these sanctions I mean have forced Russia to to basically take has forced the state to take a larger hand in the economy um and like you said Vladimir Putin is not a communist yeah but uh and but like Nancy Pelosi said also he's he's a KGB guy right and you know it's funny um in the United States right we have this meme like okay Boomer you know boomers are like typically anti-communist you know say they regurgitate all these like um anti-communist things like oh if you if you don't you just like communism because you never lived in a country that's communist blah blah stuff like that and the younger Generations are usually are more often the advocates for communism in Russia it's like the opposite okay you have Boomers that are saying like long live the Eternal ideology of Marxism leonism and uh there's like I feel like there's a an or that this um this generation this older Russian generation of exmilitary guys who are communists they've all got the same like attitude and Aura and I've SE I've seen Vladimir Putin many times in person and he's got this same thing I I call it the the the Soviet Uncle Aura because they they uh they're all nostalgic about the USSR I think you know um and uh the thing the thing with Russia first of all internationally is that even though it is capitalist it's not an imperialist country and it's also an invaluable asset to the entire socialist World it has uh built close trade military and political connections with every communist country in the world the dprk China Vietnam La Cuba you know Cuba is becoming part of the Eurasian economic Union even though it's not part of Eurasia right but Russia's still like we got to get we got to get the whole socialist World in on the multi-polar project Russ Sports Venezuela you know all all of this stuff so you know any any there's obviously a lot of socialists in the west that say that oh why why would any communist support Russia Russia's not communist it's imperialist or whatever that's super uh simplistic way to look at the situation because without Russia the Socialist world would be in a lot of hurt right now um you know you can even you can even look at the China China's economic success I mean China has a huge hand in Russian markets and that's that's a huge part of like why China is growing so so fast as well um and and so and and another thing I want to say also is that uh Vladimir Putin's if we want to go into an ideological Marxist leninist analysis of the Russian government right the although Russia's capitalist the the society is very different from Western capitalist societies the uh the political superstructure is different I I personally the based on my analysis of the whole situation I call I call Vladimir Putin a bonapartist right the for anyone who hasn't read I don't know if you've read the 18th Rumer of Louis bonapart but Karl Marx has this concept called bonapartism which is uh basically a a situation where the political super structure is such that the state controls the ruling class as opposed to the ruling class controlling the state which is usually what happens um and this is a situation that uh erupts out of the chaos of the the out of out of absolute chaos that follows some sort of revolutionary overthrow of a society and by revolutionary I mean it could mean reactionary overthrow as well I just mean in this case it's the fall of the Soviet Union um what what KL Mars was talking about in terms of why it's called bonapartism is because after the uh French Revolution came Napoleon bonapart and then he was overthrown by the forces of reaction and then France was in a chaotic period where like there the the Liberals were trying to take power and the aristocracy was fighting for power and the bisi was fighting for power and there was constant struggle in in the state in a way that no no one class could get control over Society eventually this guy uh Louis bonapart came to power um and he was able to take over the state but his his power base was like the lumpin proletariat and the military so they were um separate from any any one class and so the state itself became an org an organ of society that began to run Society in Russia it's the same thing Vladimir Putin is not a capitalist although you know under his rule the country is still capitalist and there is a capitalist class in Russia but the capitalist class cannot do anything if it contradicts what the state says and the and like like Nancy Pelosi said Vladimir Putin is a former KGB Guy usually this bonapartist governments are run by what in Russian is called siki is basically strong men men who control the states Monopoly on violence and that's basically what Vladimir Putin's Administration is in the early 2000s uh the way he got the situation under control when basically everything was being stolen out of the country from these capitalists is that he had a a meeting with the richest people in the country and basically he said look I'm in power now this is how we're going to do things and if you don't get the get with the program you're in trouble and some of them didn't get with the program and they were imprisoned they had to leave the country because at that this is this is how it usually goes at that time basic basically everyone was evading taxes right and that that uh obviously for people who are very rich can land you in jail for a long time but the government at the time wasn't enforcing anything like that it was chaos so Vladimir Putin was essentially to the to the capitalists that wanted to exploit the country for the benefit of Western corporations and make a buck like that Vladimir Putin was like okay we're going to put you down on these tax codes you're going to go away forever you're not going to be in charge of any sort of big uh capital in the country and that happened to a lot of oligarchs one one of them um one of the people who lost out on this actually uh the the grandson of the uh head of the of the former head of the Communist Party the cpusa actually Bill Browder um he no way he ended up being a Speculator in Russia that was like buying up Soviet industry and selling it off to the West in pieces and he ended up having to to get ends up getting kicked out after Vladimir Putin came to power because he's like this isn't going to go on anymore and then there were capitalists that were like okay you know you're in charge We're Not Gonna We're not gonna like rape the country essentially um and those capitalists were allowed to keep doing business as usual so that's basically the situation now the state tells them what they can and can't do and if they step out of line they're in trouble and so it's not exactly um a capitalist country country first of all that's imperialist or that's developing along an imperialist trajectory because of this very unique historical um form of governance which is very rare but uh in in Russia that's really how I would describe it as bonapar is the state the state controls the show here even though there is a capitalist class and that's one of the reasons why Putin you know said that about the Chinese system right Putin looks to China for a lot of uh like for inspiration sometimes I'm sure you know because the two the two systems are very similar and in China it's the Communist party that controls the uh oligarchs and the you know capitalist class that still exists in China and uh in Russia it's not the Communist party but it's like sort of the outgrowth of what the Soviet bureaucracy was the Soviet state bureaucracy that never really was completely destroyed after the fall of the Soviet Union yeah I watched a documentary a couple years ago that out it just is video footage of the very very early days of Putin's presidency and it's just an inside look at like the happenings of the government and there's um One Clip that was really interesting he was talking about how some there's a faction of the government that wanted to like ban the Soviet Anthem and the Soviet flag and Putin was like why would we do that our parents and our grandparents fought for this flag and for this song which is the best the Soviet Anthem is the best Anthem to ever be WR it's true and he was like why would we disgrace our our ancestors and our families by abolishing these symbols of Our National History like what the [ __ ] so that was a really that was a beautiful scene for me I thought that was great and then another clip I've seen uh of Putin and a board room or he's surround there's like a round table situation with a bunch of Russian businessmen and he's going over uh the developmental plans for Russia and just reaming into these guys being like what the [ __ ] are you doing how are you doing this to our people you cannot keep doing this anymore I'm going to finish you basically he was like very it it was like the kind of dictator you want to see of putting these businessmen in their place you know and that was that was a beautiful clip too cuz he was really pissed at them and I wish that we had somebody similar to that caliber on our side and in our government in the United States because we don't um but I've just seen these little glimpses of Putin that I'm like and reading his speeches over the years he I think he's a pretty good guy I like that guy yeah and uh you know I would even say that uh it's hard for a lot of people in the west to imagine but I think Vladimir Putin was is is democratically elected to be honest like every in the western media the last presidential election they were like oh how could he get so much you know this is just a fake election and everything but they don't understand how much the Russian people have rallied under Putin after the military operation had to be deployed and after the sanctions regime like so many people that were in the opposition before have joined the the Putin Camp after after they now basically what Putin was saying all along about NATO and the West has materialized in a way that it's affected people's personal lives and that is actually caused Again by the West's own actions that's caused many Russians to join uh Putin's political program and so in the last uh the last presidential election there was record turnout and record support for Vladimir Putin and I don't think that's that has anything to do with election rigging I think that's a real reflection of the way um Russia's become and it's all the West's own fault you know like it you were saying about the beginning of R of Putin's Administration he was trying to work with NATO he was trying to do business with the West on equal terms actually he was like oh can we be part of the capitalist club and the the West the West was like No And they haven't treated Russia as an equal ever and this is why the government has taken this uh this approach yes uh speaking of the Russian people how are they how is the temperature in Russia right now and how is everybody doing with the ongoings of the war and what was a perception of the trip to dprk in Vietnam well right now the weather is kind of hot actually um but I'm not complaining because there's so there's so little sun in Moscow when the Winter's like basically six months it's like half of the year and the winter is like almost never Sunny yeah so you have you have to take vitamin D pills otherwise you're G you're going to be in for a world of pain but uh but people here um I mean I think that the the trip to the dprk was well well received uh the kind of Western propaganda against North Korea that exists in the west doesn't really exist in Russia um I would say you know whereas people in the west say oh North Korea it's prison it's hell on Earth blah blah um the the I would say the the main Russian opinion of North Korea is like Ah that's that weird place with thead with a funny haircut you know they don't they don't really know any that much about it uh so when this started showing up on U on state media and everything uh people had a positive reaction to it you know they see it as like these guys are struggling through what we're struggling with and so we should work together it's a good thing at least that's what I've heard from like uh some people living in my building you know uh a lot a lot of the it's funny there's a lot of old ladies in in Russia because of the Dem demographic you know uh the the demographic from World War II uh you know unfortunately because of how many people died in uh the second world war when it was mostly men of course um the uh there's a lot of the the demograph the demographic is unbalanced there's a lot of older ladies in comparison to older men but they it's funny there's a lot of memes on the internet too about how they're like the Eastern European security system you know because the the older grandmas they're always they're always paying attention to everything that's going around on in the building to make sure there's no funny business going on or whatever so they make they go out of their way to meet any new person that moves into the building and so they all watch me on TV also because I show up on Russian State television and so oh yeah they're like there every time I go somewhere they're like oh I saw you on TV and when I came back for the they're all like oh my gosh this is so great love North Korea it's so great working with them so I B I base my uh my understanding of how people have reacted to that on on what I've heard from the people the older people in my building but um in terms of the conflict and its effect on Moscow and Russia I think it's already super negligible to be honest like people are just moving on with their lives I mean obviously people are dying and uh but it's it's not not like on the level of the of World War II where like every family is affected or whatever I think people are have pretty much moved on with their lives so far there haven't been any significant developments uh in the conflicts as as of late uh except of course this is I'm I'm making an exception for the people who are being bombed in Crimea as a result of these long-range missiles but as for Moscow people are just pretty much going on with their lives and the economic situation has not significantly worsened or worsened at all really I mean you could make the argument that actually it got better because um all these European companies left and now all that's happened is that Russian companies have filled that share of the market and now you have now because of Western sanctions you have a Russian economy that number one is exceeding the expectations that the World Bank and international intern international monetary fund had made for Russian growth they're exceeding all those expectations and all of these uh shares of the Russian economy that used to be owned by European companies are now Russian and the more that happens the more impervious the Russian economy is going to be to sanctions at all so it's just making the economy more independent essentially yeah that's what I've heard from other people so I'm glad to get your second confirmation on that and I'm glad you're doing good over there thanks and the Russian people are persevering and the econom is persevering because the United States economy is not persevering at all it's not doing well at all I know I return like uh to the US pretty much every year and I I've just seen how New York has become so horrible there's just like so bad there's crazy people in the streets all over the place and it's like clearly gotten very poor I mean it's like they don't give they don't give a [ __ ] about mental health about taking care of people mental health problems they just put him out in the street maybe maybe legalizing marijuana will solve the problem oh yeah that should fix everything yeah no it's gotten really bad because I was living there for a few years and had I I escaped I'm uh in Hudson Valley now once I once I got pregnant I was like we have to get the [ __ ] out of here because this is not a place for kids who the hell I know that is not a place for kids at all no become no like I was I was a nanny for years there and I would take the child that I nannied um we would walk everywhere and it's just like broken glass and used needles and like crazy people it's just i' I saw people get tased people get decked out like women get decked out right in front of me when I'm pushing a stroller with a baby in it there's like broken glass all over the playgrounds anyway get me out of the US shocking thing is that there are like there there's so many people in New York that are like wow this is the best city in the world like go to go to Moscow like just go it's like I hope I can see
