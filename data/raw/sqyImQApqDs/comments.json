They don't respect our leadership. They don't respect the United States anymore. We're like a third world nation.”\n\n11. “He allowed millions of people to come in here from prisons, jails, and mental institutions to come into our country and destroy our country.”\n\n12. “He's destroying Medicare because all of these people are coming in.”\n\n13. “The Supreme Court just approved the abortion pill.”\n\n14. “Every legal scholar throughout the world, the most respected, wanted [abortion] brought back to the states.”\n\n15. “They’re radical because they will take the life of a child in the eighth month, the ninth month, and even after birth.

People always ironically accuse him of being a liar, yet he seems to be the only one telling the truth.",

Electoral politics isn't cerebral. It's a blood sport, and refusing to enter the ring, even when the only way to win is to not engage, is a bad look.

        "text": "Here is the complete list of every lie Trump told during his debate with President Biden on Thursday provided by the Biden-Harris campaign.\n\n1. We had the greatest economy in the history of our country. We have never done so well, and everybody was amazed by it.\n\n2. The only jobs he created are for illegal immigrants and bounce-back jobs, they’re bounced back from the COVID.\n\n3. [10% universal tariff proposal is] not going to drive [prices] higher.\n\n4. [Tariff proposal is] just going to just force [other countries] to pay us a lot of money.\n\n5. I gave you the largest tax cut in history.\n\n6. I was getting out of Afghanistan, but we're getting out with dignity, with strength, with power.\n\n7. The tax cuts spurred the greatest economy that we've ever seen.\n\n8. Now, when we cut the taxes…we took in more revenue with much less tax.\n\n9. We had largely fixed [COVID].\n\n10. Throughout the entire world, we're no longer respected as a country. They don't respect our leadership. They don't respect the United States anymore. We're like a third world nation.\n\n11. He allowed millions of people to come in here from prisons, jails, and mental institutions to come into our country and destroy our country.\n\n12. He's destroying Medicare because all of these people are coming in.\n\n13. The Supreme Court just approved the abortion pill.\n\n14. Every legal scholar throughout the world, the most respected, wanted [abortion] brought back to the states.\n\n15. They’re radical because they will take the life of a child in the eighth month, the ninth month, and even after birth. After birth, if you look at the former governor of Virginia, he was willing to do this. He said, we'll put the baby aside, I will determine what we do with the baby, meaning will kill the baby.\n\n16. Under Roe v. Wade, you have late term abortion. You can do whatever you want depending on the state. You can do whatever you want.\n\n17. He decided to open up our border, open up our country to people that are from prisons, people that are from mental institutions, insane asylum, terrorists.\n\n18. He didn't need legislation because I didn't have legislation. I said close the border.\n\n19. [Migrants are] living in luxury hotels in New York City and other places.\n\n20. He doesn't care about our veterans. He doesn’t care. He doesn’t like the military at all, and he doesn't care about our veterans.\n\n21. I had the highest approval rating for veterans taking care of the VA. He has the worst. He's gotten rid of all the things that I approved.\n\n22. First of all, that was a made-up quote, ‘suckers and losers.’ They made it up.\n\n23. Our veterans and our soldiers can't stand this guy. They can't stand him. They think he’s the worst Commander in Chief, if that’s what you call him, that we’ve ever had.\n\n24. He did nothing to stop [Russia’s invasion of Ukraine]. In fact, I think he encouraged Russia from going in.\n\n25. Iran was broke with me. I wouldn't let anybody do business with them. They ran out of money. They were broke.\n\n26. You had no terror at all during my administration.\n\n27. Nancy Pelosi, if you just watched the news from two days ago, on tape to her daughter, who's a documentary filmmaker they say, but she's saying, ‘Oh, no, it's my responsibility. I was responsible for this’ because I offered them 10,000 soldiers or National Guard. And she turned them down.\n\n28. The unselect committee, which is basically two horrible Republicans that are all gone now, out of office, and Democrats, all Democrats, they destroyed and deleted all the information they found because they found out we were right. We were right. And they deleted and destroyed all of the information.\n\n29. Telling the Ukrainian people that we're going to want a billion dollars or you change the prosecutor, otherwise you're not getting a billion dollars. If I ever said that, that's quid pro quo.\n\n30. I didn't have sex with a porn star.\n\n31. He basically went after his political opponent because he thought it was going to damage me.\n\n32. He made up the Charlottesville story.\n\n33. He caused the inflation and it's killing Black families and Hispanic families.\n\n34. They can’t buy groceries anymore, they can't, you look at the cost of food where it's doubled and tripled and quadrupled. They can’t live, they’re not living anymore.\n\n35. [European countries] don’t want anything that we have.\n\n36. Almost every police group in the nation from every state is supporting Donald J. Trump. Almost every police group.\n\n37. And what he's done to the black population is horrible, including the fact that for ten years he called them super-predators.\n\n38. And yet during my four years, I had the best environmental numbers ever.\n\n39. The Paris accord was going to cost us $1 trillion and China nothing and Russia, nothing, and India nothing. It was a rip off of the United States and I ended it because I didn't want to waste that money because they treated us horribly…. Nobody else was paying into it and it was, it was a disaster.\n\n40. I'm the one that got the insulin down for the seniors. I took care of the seniors.\n\n41. [On migrants] They're taking over our schools our hospitals, and they're going to be taking over our schools or hospitals, and they're going to be taking over Social Security.\n\n42. But Social Security - he's destroying it because millions of people are pouring into our country and they are putting them onto Social Security. They’re putting them onto Medicare, Medicaid. They’re putting them in our hospitals.\n\n43. He wants open borders. He wants our country to either be destroyed, or he wants to pick up those people as voters.\n\n44. He wants the Trump tax cuts to expire.\n\n45. He wants to raise your taxes by four times. He wants to raise everybody’s taxes by four times.\n\n46. We now have the largest [trade] deficit in the history of our country under this guy. We have the largest deficit with China.\n\n47. He gets paid by China. He's a Manchurian candidate. He gets money from China. So I think he’s afraid to deal with them.\n\n48. We had two cases, we paid $6 billion for five people.\n\n49. They talk about a relatively small number of people that went to the Capitol, and in many cases were ushered in by the police.\n\n50. I would have much rather accepted these [election results in 2020], but the fraud and everything else was ridiculous.",

They did all that for him and Biden still couldn't pass the finish line. This was the most favorable field CNN could offer him and he still performed like this. No wonder they had no problem saying he got cooked afterwards. You notice nobody really comments on how well Trump did. Honestly this was probably one of Trumps worst showings in a debate. He didn't sell himself as much as he could have, he didn't really slam Biden when Biden made false accusations, he basically completely avoided the question about child care costs but at the very least Trump could keep the topic straight in his head. Trump won by being able to finish a sentence on the same topic it started on. That's how abysmally low the bar was.",

There's no way Biden has enough gas in the tank to finish another term. It's just not happening. If you compare 2020 Biden a guy everyone said had problems keeping it together mentally and 2024 Biden... it's a very stark difference.

He said he didn't have sex with a porn star (like come on, we can all agree that's a lie, right?) Said Biden is responsible for a \"wave of illegal immigrants killing us like we've never seen\" which has no statistics to back it up. Just a couple highly publicized events. He hinted at Biden nudging or encouraging Russia to attack Ukraine. Not sure what he's ever talking about with that one. Claims Biden got a cut of Hunter's payoffs from that Chinese energy corp. Not impossible, but no evidence. Trump claims Biden wants to increase taxes fourfold. Which isn't true. It wouldn't raise any taxes for anyone making less than $400k and isn't four times even on the highest earners. Trump said he ended catch & release at the border. Even if he wanted to, it's not true simply because we don't have the cells. So just basic reality means we catch, and release them. Claimed he had the safest border in US history. Yet he had more illegal crossing than any year under Obama even. He says people are taking lives of babies at 8 and 9 months. That's ludicrous. Just another lie trying to twist facts about a random interview from the Virginia governor, I think. He claimed we had no terror at all under his administration in the U.S. We had multiple ISIS inspired terrorism attacks on US soil that killed a number of people. I mean, they weren't ISIS sponsored, just inspired, but still, not true. Said we had the lowest taxes ever on Jan 6th. Which, isn't true. I could go on? Not saying Biden doesn't lie. But it's WAY less. Not saying Biden should be president. Just saying, one utterly, and blatantly lies, constantly. Quite literally ALMOST every single statement he made has some sort of mistruth, misrepresentation or a blatant lie.",

        "text": "​@laserlobotomy I already posted my long list, looks like YT deleted it. Let me rewrite it out for ya. Not like you're actually going to accept it even if I give you A DOZEN. I know this is pointless but the fact is, Trump lies quite literally in almost every single statement he made. It's either a straight up lie, a misrepresentation, some BS he's been saying for years that's long been proven untrue, or is simply misleading. Biden had quite a few slightly un-true statements as well. Just not even close to as many and all were based in truth, he just got the numbers wrong. Probably because he's too freakin old. For Trump, it's instinctual. \n\nTrump insinuated Biden is a Manchurian candidate being paid by China. He also asserted Biden got a cut from Hunter's payments from that Chinese energy company. Even if true, which isn't unbelievable, there's NO PROOF.\nHe claims Biden wants to raise taxes by 400%. In reality, taxes only go up in Biden's plan for one's who make over $400k. And it's not by 400%\nHe claims undocumented are being put on Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid under Biden. Not true. In fact, they pay in but never receive the benefits. It's not like that's legal, even if it is happening in small numbers through fraud.\nFood has doubled, tripled, or quadrupled. I'm not sure it's even doubled outside of rare items. And that's not related to inflation, but I think articles say 50% of recent price rises are simply corporate profit. Trump isn't any more prone than Biden to fight the corps for scalping a national tragedy.\nI had the best environmental numbers ever. Not true. At least until his last year during Covid, which of course CO2 emissions were down. So, it's misleading. In reality he gutted Clean Air Act and got rid of 100 environmental regulations.\nHe claims Biden calls blacks super-predators. He's been doing this for a while but that was Clinton who said that... in 1996 in reference to black youths in gangs and drug dealing. We all know this is an issue. But Biden never said that.\nClaims he had the best immigration numbers. In reality, immigration slightly dropped his first year, rose again, dropped just as Covid hit and then exploded his last few months of office during covid (in comparison to Obama)\nClaims he ended catch and release at the border. Not true, just by simple virtue of not having enough cells we still do catch and release. Even if he wanted to end this, he didn't and took the lazy way out of just getting a talking point.\nClaims 18 million illegals came in. Stats don't support that. There were only 11.4 million encounters total under Biden, estimated 4 million were turned away. Very few are actually slipping in undetected nowadays because the entire point is to walk up to Border Patrol and claim asylum. Which, hey, Biden just put a cap on.\nHe asserts Democrats want to abort babies at 8 and 9 months. Utterly absurd and is illegal in EVERY state. Again, a classic Trump misrepresentation, skewing words the Virginia gov said in relation to something. Classic Trump lie. It has a sliver of truth in it's origins, then he twists it.\nClaims his China tarrifs brought in income. When in reality they cost the avg american family like $1,700-2,350 (from right wing think-tank)\nClaims the only jobs Biden created were for illegal immigrants or bounce back from covid jobs. Not true, even if, like I said, a classic trump lie, there is a sliver of truth in that a lot of the jobs were bounce back jobs.\nStill claims Biden indicted him. He didn't.\nI gave the largest tax cut in history. Just not true at all.\nI had the lowest taxes in history. Just not true, especially if counting income tax didn't' exist pre 1913.....\nTrump claims he was who lowered insulin prices. Barely half true. He did a voluntary program of which basically only 1/3rd actually did. Biden made it mandatory and covered more types of Insulin.\nWe had no terror attacks under my administration. Not true. We had 2 ISIS inspired terrorist attacks in America during Trump. Like a dozen killed. And multiple other domestic terrorism cases his DOJ prosecuted.\nHe claimed Pelosi took full responsibility for Jan 6th in effort to push responsibility off himself. False. Pelosi said she took responsibility for not having Capital Police prepare more. A classic Trump skewing of truth.\nWe had the largest deficit in our country's history under Biden. That was the 2020 budget.... Trump's last budget in office.... Which is fair, he had to spend because of covid. STILL a lie.\n\nThere's literally a dozen plus more of these. Not all are bold faced lies, but most are. Let alone, the man has 30,000 plus documented lies online where you can literally reference every single one and it'll show you when/where he said it. Many are the same lie, over and over and over again. But it's still 30k plus.",

Now most everyone is at least aware of the numbers and which demographics it’s affecting and why. It’s also hard to argue that you are just killing some cells and it’s to save a woman’s life. The issue becoming more popular has lead to arguments that disprove major talking points. For example there’s no reason to directly and intentionally kill a baby to save a mother’s life, you just deliver the baby early. Even the pro aborts are starting to acknowledge some basic realities of abortion which you probably couldn’t confidently say in 2015.",
