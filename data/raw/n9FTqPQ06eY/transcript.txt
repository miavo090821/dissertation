[Music] and we are live Beautiful People welcome to another episode of Kiko freethinkers Forum this is episode 144 and we have a two-time guest with us and a three-time guest in caros Garo and Noah kivic and we have a lot to discuss today if you want to go back and check out some of our previous episodes 54 I had Carlos on 101 and then on 83 Noah and Carlos came on together and we had some very good disc discussion I know today is going to be a subsequent um just a beautiful discussion I can't wait to share this with my audience um two people associated with the midwestern marks Institute uh Carlos is a one of the co-founders and he's also a publisher of many books U just a few listed here Marxism and the dialectical materialist worldview uh the Purity fetish and the crisis of Western Marxism and he just posted a new one called why we need American Marxism and I haven't had a chance to read that one and I know that also Noah has a lot to do with his editing processes just so you all know so it's not just Carlos doing everything by himself there's always a team behind there you know you for to have a good writer you got to have a team with you and he's also an editor of a book called or or a series called red America which is a journal an internal Journal within this whole umbrella term of American Communist party which is a newly founded party this is going to be probably the first hour of the discussion is going to be about the American Communist party because I'm curious about this and that's their Journal red America and Kik also has editing um capabilities in Journal of American Socialist studies so he has a lot of different um duties within the midwestern marks Institute uh these gentlemen have been nice to share their time with me today and I just want to welcome them back onto the show and thanks for accepting the invitation again thank you so much for having us on Kiko it's a pleasure and as uh we were talking before we went here um you know the conversations we've had three for myself now with you have been some of the most enjoyable and insightful um so it's very much a pleasure to be back yeah I second that absolutely pleasure to be here thank you for having us absolutely and it couldn't be any other way I could feel the respect from the first episode and it's been like that with all my guests I can really say that every guest I've had on I've had a great rapport with we keep in touch and um I just want to give a slight ad and just say thanks to all the beautiful people out there listening and watching um we've reached almost 1,400 Subs didn't think that that was ever going to happen we're a fully monetized channel uh it is a public service for I considered it a public service for and here we talk about cultural issues and political issues a good healthy dose of both and we have about 42% of our audience located outside of the United States that was always the point to be an International Community forum and just um tell your friends and family to share subscribe and like the content I think that there's something here for everybody I really believe that there's something here for everybody if you open your mind a little bit just um don't even give me a dime spend a little bit of your time to expand your mind and remember you can't unthink free thought so let's get start with this discussion this third discussion with these gentlemen and my first thing would be if we're talking to somebody like my mom for instance that doesn't know anything about political Theory how do you explain something like dialectical materialism like well how these types of terminologies kind of going back to what we talked about in the second discussion how do we equate these terminologies in a language to where people can have the understanding if they don't have a college degree for instance because half the country has a fifth grade reading level so how do we get those terms to resonate with people well that's a really good question um and I think that whole lot of the uh people that have called themselves Marxist a lot of them within the Academy have done a real disservice for the Marxist worldview because I think that if we really break it down as far as the meaning of some of these uh terms that might seem obscure they're almost common sensical uh for dialectical materialism when we use that term what we're referring to is the Marxist worldview or the Marxist philosophy the Marxist approach to understanding the world and um you know postulating in certain uh statements about how the world actually works and it's really quite uh basic it says that um the world is in a constant state of flux so nothing in the world is static everything is constantly changing things change uh not out of some Randomness but because Within These processes that things exist in there are these things called contradictions uh which is again a term that could be a bit obscured uh but all it means is that uh within entities there's not this homogenity this complete uniformity there's multiple things that are uh multiple aspects or um opposites as we like to use in our tradition that are operative within uh entities in processes and those uh Dynamics between opposing forces within things are what shape the things development so at a very practical level consider yourself as an individual everyone has opposing Tendencies you know some tendencies that point one way some tendencies that point another and where you actually go is a product of those opposing tendencies that you uh contain within yourself as an individual that means that one entity yourself contains opposing forces within that um so that's that's what we refer to as a contradiction and that's something that most people accept and the third most basic component is that everything in the world is interconnected to everything else and again you know we have many common sense idioms to um refer to this knowledge we have for instance the famous example of of the butterfly you step on a butterfly and somehow uh something in some other corner of the world changes and that's because you know the world really is in a constant state of flux there really are things such as contradictions operative within the things that are moving and everything is interconnected to everything else and when we refer to dialectical materialism what we're saying is uh these sorts of insights uh that are in a sense common sensical to most people uh these uh this is how the world operates and if we try to understand the world in a way that uh tries to separate things from their context we're not going to understand it if we try to understand the world in a way that separates things from their movement we're not going to understand it and if we try to understand the world in a way that says uh well when we see contradictions at play that means that what we have before us is some sort of falsity uh the absence of Truth we're also not going to be able to understand world so um at at the very Bare Bones of what um the Marxist worldview is it's it's this worldview that sees things in movements that sees the existence of contradictions as you know a basic reality of that movement and that sees everything interconnected to everything else um do do you mind about shim in here Kiko of course who are you talking about so so I actually uh this is sort of where I live right I work in the trades and I'm constantly explaining these kind of things for people without College educations I mean and who aren't even oriented towards you know thinking more deeply uh but they come to me with questions about you know politics and Society because I'm noted around the shop is the guy who who who who knows about that stuff so what I really do is impress upon them that um the minute we see something on the very surface right like we're looking at this screen right now this screen isn't all there is to it right there's a whole internal uh sort of uh bits and pieces components that make it up right and what Marxism is here to do is try to understand the history that leads from all of these little uh pieces that that that you know could be separate on their own uh towards that screen itself becoming what it is so what we do is try to understand how things got from being at a to being at B right how they develop and when we look at how they develop that's when we get to the things that that Carlos was talking about the the the contradictions right that uh whatever is you know most General within a given thing that has to drive its development forward that's where we begin our analysis and then we look for the next point of necessity and the next point until we get from all these little component pieces to the whole screen okay that actually makes sense to someone like myself I don't claim to be any sort of a label particularly but I'm thinking of this I could digest I could understand that what you that explanation I appreciate those explanations so that kind of leads into another question and we will kind of get into the American Communist part and like that Inception and everything else but I'm just curious what is some of the most challenging things when you're teaching your students because I know both of y'all offer courses in Marxism what what have been some of the challenges in your teaching experience as far as like conceptually or whatever it may be or there some things to give your students more issues than others can you mind if I go first Carlos because this is sort of um my area of of of more like deeper theoretical work right now is digging into the problems with the way that we're taught to think in general in society right the way we're taught that the acquisition of knowledge happens um where where we sort of in school we get taught to memorize things right we take standardized tests we memorize dates and names and history class um and everything gets sort of reduced to these memorizationscripture not verifying that preconception um that's why the sort of you get people that read in news headlines and they either gravitate towards Fox News or MSNBC right because those tend to verify the things that they learned and memorized growing up but if we take this more developmental approach to how knowledge happens right that I was just explaining then the entire process becomes verifying whether those things we memorized are thorough enough or even false uh and it gives us a better range so what I try to impress upon my students is to when they see the word dialectical be begin thinking developmental right and to start doing this because it's the only way that I've found that gets uh through to the primary problem which is people try to read things in order to confirm those preconceptions and we're coming out of this really dark period of our history for the ruling for the working class that is um because of the immense amount of falsification there has been regarding Marxism regarding communism the history and the theory so we have to begin by attacking not even just each preconception but the tendency we all have to try to verify those preconceptions yeah if I can add uh just a couple things you know one of the things that I mentioned uh in answering your first uh question was that what dialectical materialism is is something that's common sense if you really break it down and an example I usually provide is a boxing fight right um no one would trust a judge that just got there on the 12th round uh and and judge the fight on the basis of seeing just the last round uh people understand you know on a basic Common Sense level that to judge the fight correctly you need to see it as a process how all the rounds are connected to all the other ones and how they develop into each other and you know the fight is itself a contradiction you got one ring and two opposing forces two people throwing hands so we understand that at at a very basic level but at the same time as there's Common Sense components in people's thinking that are aligned with what is in our opinion a more correct way of approaching the world there's also tendencies that are opposed to that that push us towards thinking in uh the form that we call abstractly so uh I know that when we use the term abstract what comes to people's minds is sort of Plato's image of the Stargazer someone that's disconnected from practical concerns but if you go to the atmology the original meaning of abstract it comes from the Latin word abstractas which means to disconnect something from its context and all of the institutions in the society that we live in promote a form of thinking that is abstract they don't want us to think about things in their movement in their process they don't want us to think about things and how they're connected to other things they want us to see conflict and contradiction within things as a sign of falsity not as a sign of complexity because in order to think through those contradictions we have to be able to be capable uh to participate in complex thinking not in this very simplistic shallow superficial thinking so the thing is that when we engage with individuals that we're trying to teach we have to realize that we live in a society where at the same time as there's Common Sense kernels that they uh that that show us that they already accept a dialectical materialist worldview there's other components in their world views in their spontaneous philosophies um in the way they approach the world that push them in another Direction so the key is analyzing what are the starting points where people uh we're teaching are at and how on the basis of those starting points can we identify the more rational uh kernels out of which they're thinking about the world tease those out and in the process of teasing those out show how perhaps some other components of their more incoherent uh World Views um fall in a direct contradiction with the most rational ones so uh it's all about in terms of teaching understanding that there's no uh one siiz fits-all approach and this is something that if you look back at Soviet uh pedagogical Theory or even American pragmatist pedagogical Theory I'm a student and very closely of the philosophy of John dwey I work at my University setting at the center for Dewey studies where all of his manuscripts and unpublished manuscripts are that's part of what I do um you know for a living I I added the manuscripts that um we have from his lectures in China where he spent three years both in the do in pragmatist tradition and in the Marxist leninist tradition in our tradition we realize that in order to actually teach you need to know where people are starting at you need to appeal to their common sense and the place that you want them to go the thing you want them to learn has to somehow be connected to something that they already know um and teaching has to be integrated into the Practical concerns into a a um a a web of meaningfulness that is uh embedded in where people are at you can't teach people about something that when they start learning about it it's completely meaningless from the standpoint of the Practical problems that they have in their life you have to make the learning process something that is Meaningful and connected to the Practical concerns and problems that people have before them and I think in the sense of Marxism this is uh this is not the hardest thing to do because I think a whole lot of the problems that people experience in their individual lives are tied to this parasitic system that we call capitalism and this method that we have of understanding the world is the same one we have for understanding and explaining how it is that that system uh manifests itself in in various individual ills that people are discontented by in their lives I just it's fascinating hearing you all explain this Stu because it makes sense to me and I still contend that it has a lot to do with something that you said for sure you mentioned the spontaneity of these circumstances that we live in and we naturally have a dialectical approach you're right about that they're naturally contradictory elements that we're around and we accept those contradictions but we can easily be led astray too that that makes total sense it does the way you explained it but I still but do you feel like that that's still not a factor when it comes to someone that's educated versus not educated or or or do you have to explain it a different way like do you have to use analogies like how do you get because I don't think you could tell that same thing that you just explained to someone else I knew for instance and I don't know if they would interpret it the same way I did I think I think a lot of it uh depends on your uh meeting someone wherever they're at right and being able to speak their language the way I I I talk to sort of college educated liberals is different than the way I talk to you know my friends and my co-workers uh uh and my family about about these kind of things um ironically I think that the most college educated people I know have a harder time getting this stuff and uh a harder time letting go of their preconceptions M than most regular you know uneducated workingclass people I think that the education of the real world gives you a much more well-rounded view of how Society is because you're experiencing it and when you're cut off from that larger society in a college campus Say by sorry Carlos I Carlos is the exception he knows this um by being a teacher right and stuck within this college campus atmosphere that can skew how you view everything and you can sort of develop a tunnel vision just for the the campus you're on and that's a very tiny section of society because it's kids at the end of their development out of being kids right um it's before they really get into the workforce before they develop into the the full-fledged adults they're going to be and so there's still a lot of um dogmatic thinking and that would be a whole discussion on how to get why that happens but that's kind of what it is we have to remember I mean these institutions posit themselves they purport to be centers of free thinking yeah the Locust for where people come to search for the truth but I think most people are not naive enough to believe that most people understand that they serve a function in society and that function is to get people to think although in various forms in ways that align with what the ruling Elite needs people to think like so we call it education but in a way these institutions are Ed uh institutions of miseducation what they do is strip uh the the almost Common Sense spontaneous uh awareness of how the world works that Noah was was talking about by adding um all of these different forms of abstractions or abstract thinkings that I was mentioning that are uh then validated socially by the fact that the academy ends up becoming a silo its own little uh world of its of its own and the title provides a certain sense of hubris that closes off the humility that's necessary to realize that you don't know everything and I'm sure we've all met our fair share of people that just because they have a title in their hand think that they know better than the worker working in a you know in a steel mill uh in town or something like that and that's not always the case you know sometimes it might be the case but uh our experience has been that that uh common sense that working people have places them often times a lot closer to what we consider to be the correct way of understanding the world than some of the the college educated and usually you know college educated liberals because the the academy are in terms of iological alignment most of the time fairly liberal that makes sense I know a lot of my friends that listening to this um are you taking notes no just no not to diging people because um I think there's going to be a a point where and I I even sense it just with the growth of the form and I know you all have sensed this when you get bigger you start to connect with different audiences and then you have to learn how to engage with these different audiences and sometimes you get surprised I mean a lot of times what you think happens but sometimes if you give that contact of Engagement a chance you know there may be some common grounding that see can grow some and you see that a lot with um these types of dialogues and so I don't want to write people off and that's why I encourage people election night we're going to have live coverage here on the Forum but we're not even going to be talking about the election we're going to be talking about after the election like what can we be doing between the lines 365 days a year people are so concerned about this circus up until the two months leading to it and then it's like you don't hear about these people again and we have to be that things we can be doing now we don't have to wait for these circuses to happen like we can do things ourselves like we need to be organizing all the time like we don't really have the luxury to sit around and just wait for these people to play games on us but I I hope people are um starting to wake up to the possibility that they can be active even though it feels like that they're like in despair all the time but I think a lot of it has to do with the mainstream media and the institutions they've told them that this election is the most important election in your lifetime which is we know that is but that's what they tell people and I think it goes into that indoctrination that you're talking about before it's all has to to do with the way you take in the information and Liberals are going to be just as susceptible as anybody else yeah they they say that every four years right uh the old party before before we reconstituted the Communist party they if you look at what they were saying uh 30 years ago it's basically the same speeches they give right now you know this so and so Republican is actually secretly a fascist so we have to engage with the Democrats because they're the worst there's ever been and don't worry we'll go back to being communists right after this one I mean at what point do you you know say like this is crazy why are we still listening to you the the the whole we you know what we would call the Bourgeois electoral system just seems so uh uh illegitimate and and not that important I mean no matter if if KLA Harris WI or Trump wins our lives are going to continue getting a little bit worse every day right like I'm thinking of you could do anything other than watch live election coverage I should do like a stream saying instead of watching the election watch me eat two large pizzas in a row because that would be more impressive than whoever wins like who cares right they're the same thing that's hilarious Okay so I like I'm not actually gonna eat two large pizzas by the way that's insane I like always watching the election so the ACP people I kind of lied about the way this is going we're gonna push it off a little bit because that's the thing I like about it man I don't I come up with some questions sometimes I have some thoughts I want to come up with but there's no Chron chronology here you know we just we go with the win sometimes and sometimes that's the way to go um and it kep kind of leads into a question I have but I have to get this one out because I'm responding to Noah Noah posted something I think it was earlier this week and he said something like communism is and what is not so I want to know what is communism what is Marxism and what is socialism and I know that this is probably like a crash course but like how will you explain that to someone before we continue uh let me just first say everything you've ever heard both for and against forget it really forget it it's based on some sort of distortion or falsification or lot um all of these dogmas that we that that develop such as communism is a classless stateless moneyless society you can go through everything mors Engles lennin ma fto Castro I mean down and down the list not a single one of them ever wrote that phrase right and I'm not saying they just didn't write that phrase in that direct order it's because what that does when combined with the way we naturally tend to think of things in this sort of static non-developmental Frozen in Time way is that it reduces what we call the process of Communism and a new Society coming about to some future Utopia that it it gets it backwards it puts this idea that we have of this classless stateless moneyless society first and that we are sort of forcing reality to become this idea that we've just pulled directly out of our heads Marx calls communism the riddle of History solve he calls it the real movement of history and he calls it the the uh return to the community on a higher stage of development and what he means by that is that there are already this there is already this process of society existing as a contradiction as as like the state becomes a thing it it it arises in order to sort of try to uh mediate irreconcilable differences in society that are caused by the very way that Society itself reproduces itself so in capitalism that means generalized commodity production the the center of human interaction uh becomes commodity exchange and how we do that and the various forms that that goes through in the development of society right uh I can kick it I know I'm kind of rambling here so I can kick it over to Carlos to continue because I'm sure he knows exactly what I'm talking about and that way you can hear from both of us um yeah one of the things that Noah started uh his answer with was you know forget about everything you've heard about communism from both uh people who claim to be supporters and and critics it's kind of easy to imagine why you should forget what the critics say right you know who are the main critics well the same establishment that benefits from a working population that thinks that communism which in reality seeks to represent uh them is somehow this authoritarian World Order that's going to destroy everything take people's property etc etc but why the friends right kill babies and babies babies and all these other things um but why would we ignore what the purported friends of of Communism or of socialism have said about it well this requires an understanding of how what we call bouro ideology or the ideas the systematic ideas that defend and help to produce the world we live in in the US how have they developed and in the US during the period of the Cold War there was a program that was promoted by individuals such as Melvin lasi and and others um that eventually culminated in the Congress for cultural Freedom which was this institution that was designed at basically um removing the Marxism out of Marxism by promoting with billions of dollars worth of resources and institutions and journals uh a form of compatible left and that term itself compatible left it comes from a CIA agent named Thomas Braden who was involved in this process and he said what we need is a compatible left meaning a left that presents itself as critical of capitalism but that condemns actually existing socialism and communism but that participates in a thinking that is not at all Marxist in the sense that we discussed earlier in this program but that resembles more the form of abstract thinking that the ruling institutions want us to participate in so in our day and age after we've seen Decades of billions of dollars funneled to proliferate this compatible left when Noah says that we must ignore everything that both the friends and enemies of Marxism have said about Marxism it's because the friends of Marxism have the themselves been enemies um created specifically by the ruling institutions uh to divert the attention of people who are struggling in their everyday life and seek an alternative away from actual Communists who are being repressed through the Smith Act and and McCarthyism and towards the acceptable Marxist or the acceptable uh socialist as far as communism in the American context communism has a very simple meaning that is already accepted by the American people this might sound a bit uh bombastic but the average American already accepts communism let me explain why the average American accepts the conception of democracy as in the words of Lincoln in the Gettysburg Address government of by and for the people in terms of actual governance in terms of the actual society that Communists seek to create all that it is is a society where the government the economy the media apparatuses the educational institution the culture industry or entertainment industry where all of the industries that compose a society a form of life operate not for the sake of enriching a small group of people who own those institutions and private uh and profit privately from them but for the sake of enriching human life of enriching Society itself all that communism is is a society that works for society itself where individuals um are able to live in a world where the conditions are created so that they can flourish in conjunction with the community that's what's part of the contradiction of capitalist individualism at the same time as they posit the individual as the most holy in a sense they create a society where the vast majority of individuals are forced to live in misery indebted alienated depressed so communism seeks to create that society that works for society itself and because we have this understanding of the interdependency of the social and the individual at the same time it will free up individuals to be able to pursue lives that are genuinely human to be able to flourish in their individual lives so that's that's really what what communism comes down to this process whereby by the very own contradictions that exist in class society and its culmination point in capitalist class Society those tensions cannot just uh stay there for eternity you know if you put a if you turn a pressure cooker on it's not just going to stay there until the Sun Burns Out you know it's going to pop at some point and at some point people are going to get tired of their existence and realize that they can run things themselves for the sake of uh benefiting themselves working people the vast majority of the American public not just a small group of uh bankers and investment firms and and big corporations so that's all communism is and if if a person considers themselves a tune to the American tradition of democracy to the values of 1776 and the most Progressive values of the American experiment there's no way they can't align themselves with the Communist maybe they don't have to call themselves Communists but they will see indeed through the work of Communists that the world we want to bring about is one that they already think uh America um you know promises for them you know part of the problem that people um observe in our current Society is the fact that we're promised a but given B right we promised government of by and for the people right to life liberty Pursuit of Happiness all these different things but none of us actually have that in the real world the order that the elite have created is completely antagonistic to that but that a that they want fulfilled that a that they believe in that they accept as what it means to be American and as American democracy that's all communism is that's how communism would be realized in America and that's why thinkers from Marx angles to Lin have said that it is in America where the most fertile soil for communism exists because our people already accept ideals that in order for them to be realized to make to be made actual requires communism uh let let me just add one more thing on to there about the rights um and I want to come at it two ways one we always hear about this like you know like private property abolition of private property and people are like oh my God like they're gonna take my house and my car and my daughter and you know they're all Gonna Come dance with my sister and whatever else right which is crazy but I want to say that re the USA was found founded on promises right and at the time they were understood to be promises and that is the rights to life liberty and the pursuit of happiness uh and a lot of the so-called anti-communists who if you actually examine their views they believe in communism they just don't understand the word um they say well you know nobody owes anyone anything and that's correct right nobody owes anyone anything just because to think that would be kind of crazy right it would be the sense of entitlement that uh old people are always complaining about young people have right another story um but if we think about the actual fulfillments of those rights we us Americans in in the 21st century are born into a world where everything has been claimed monopolized ized and financialized before we're even born the right to life is ransomed to us by giant healthc care conglomerates big Pharma insurance conglomerates right the light the right to Liberty or the the ability to find self-fulfillment is ransomed To Us by the the having to sell our labor to someone else in order to get small chunks because you know things were taken before we were ever born and if we even want a shot in owning a tiny bit of Liberty then we have to do that and get someone else Rich for doing nothing just like with the right to life right and the I mean the pursuit of happiness has connected to Liberty right you can't pursue happiness if you don't have the Liberty to go about your business as you see fit and I want to connect this to property because it is that property and the trans peration of uh uh of you know John Lock's life liberty and property to Thomas Jefferson's life liberty and the pursuit of happiness that begins the first step in the process of American communism right in the Communist Manifesto uh marks and Engles basically say the opposite of what all the so-called anti-communists say and I want to read a quote from them on uh a private property and its abolition to kind of get people thinking in a new way about what they actually say and they say you are horrified and are intending to do away with private property but in your existing Society private property is already done away with for 9/10 of the population and these days it's more over 90% of the population has a zero or less than zero Network they continue its existence for the Fe is solely due to its non-existence in the hands of those nine10 right all of us being forced to to pay them to get the things we need right you reproach us therefore with intending to do away with a form of property the necessary condition for whose existence is a non-existence of any property for the immense majority of society in one word you reproach us with intending to do away with your property precisely so and that is just what we intend so if you think about it what we intend to do is do away with the property that removes the ability to own any property for the immense majority of society therefore increasing the access to property for everyone right fulfilling the ability to have your own life liberty and a real Pursuit of Happiness and for us that's American communism this this is hilarious not in the sense that what you're explaining but before I came on and I was formulating some of the questions I you hit on two of them already but I'm still going to kind of get you take on it just in your um discourse there I hear Libertarians saying the same thing I hear some Libertarians they it's almost verbatim but they swear up and down that they anti-communist I just it's hilarious to me but it kind of leads to a question I have so what what Carlos said earlier is interesting I've always thought this myself I like to be very calm and comfortable with something before IED it to describe myself and I think that's part of the issue with the United States and probably other parts of the world is a labeling in itself I know it's messed up our political discourse because uh labels have really done some damage because we focus more on label than we do like the practicality of the matter we don't even focus on like the practicality of we're focusing on something else we're focusing on a word and I've said this a lot of times on the history of the Forum that certain areas of the country I believe are more conducive to Communism and um if we're talking about macro level would you agree with that statement that or is there a GEOS specificity involved with this or there certain parts of the country that are more conducive to Communism and on a micro level whether it be a church or a school or a library or their potential element there for that to be more I guess a fostered environment of Communism like how does that work in United States for instance that's a really good question and uh this is something we've thought about I mean there's countries that have had uh socialist Revolutions in the century such as Venezuela for instance that they don't really have to deal with a regionalized reality in their country their country's fairly small the population's fairly small Cuba you know 1959 I think the population was like 8 million people I mean we have cities that are bigger than that so um the reality of American socialism is going to have to have an understanding of the regionalized realities of our country right and one of the things that we realize um with the question of of socialism and I think we spoke a little bit about this either in the first or second uh interview we did together that socialism in general doesn't exist it always takes a specific form and that form is uh National in character and in a country that is as vast and regionalized as ours is we can even say that uh determining also the national character is certain Regional uh characteristics that have to be accounted for the culture of the US South is different from the culture of uh the northeast of the country which is different from the culture of the Midwest and different from the culture of the West Coast and there's points of similarities that's why it's you know we can speak about a whole nation but there's also uh unique Regional uh differences for us contrary to a lot of the entities and organizations that claim to be left that we have uh broken out of those organizations thought that it's really in the coast where you find the most fertile human material for communism right it's in the college Ed educated liberals uh in New York or in the college educated liberals in in in Los Angeles or something um or in Chicago that's when you that's where you find um the human material that's ready to go for communism because they think about the world in a in in a sort of a a diagram where there's right there's left the liberal is left they're closer to Communism and there has nothing to do with Marxism our approach to winning over people is based on a class analysis not on what people think and so those liberals in the Coast with six figure salaries with a college education which we already spoke about in terms of a miseducation I don't care if they're liberals and in this diagram that you have developed in your head that's closer to the ultra left that we are that's not how the world works the people that are closer to communist uh thinking are those that are uh the most uh the the biggest benefactors and those that Marxism was itself developed in order to understand their condition which is working people and the industrial base of the country is still in the midwest it's also in parts of the US South and uh honestly in the last since 2016 a whole chunk of that workingclass base was a part of the magga movement and one of the things that I think was the most distinctive out of the last interview we did together was that you look through uh the website of the old Communist Party the cpusa oh God and you said oh my God this just sounds like MSNBC uh liberals you know the fascist threat and magga fascist and all these different things that's not Marxism that's pure liberalism Marxism holds that this is the base for communism because it's Working Class People discontented by the established order discontented by The Establishment deep State whatever they call it and you can say Okay wrongly they see Trump as uh this sort of figure that's anti-establishment but they're already a step ahead of most of the rest of the country um that doesn't uh realize that there's something wrong and that they need to act so what we have found in our personal experience organizing in the midwest organizing in parts of the US South organizing in the rural areas in the coastal regions is that these people a lot of them who identify with Trump some of them are a political some of them liked Bernie actually that's the base for socialism not the Cosmopolitan Coastal Elites it's it's the Deep America the American people um not these sections of the country that look indistinguishable from any other capital of any other country you go to London and you find the same cats you see in New York you go to whatever other major capital of the West and it's same type of people the people that are the most uniquely American rural communities in Midwest that's the base out of which Communism is going to develop because that's the organic spontaneous working class that we have here in the country can I can I add something about the the so left and right of course you can um the way we're taught to think about these is uh in my I mean in the Marxist view not properly reflective of reality the way we're taught to think of a leftist is they have this view that view um Etc the same on on with Rus from a different perspective but for Marxism we View what is left and right in terms of what develops Society right and the terms come from the French Revolution right literally the the people sitting on the left side of the auditorium in their in their governing body I forget what it was called some French word right I don't speak French I'm American I you know uh whatever I don't eat bagett I don't wear Beret um but I'm sorry I I can't resist stupid jokes um we're picking on the French uh but uh I I I lost my okay so so the people sitting on the left side of the auditorium were those interested in moving past the monarchy right to a republic to socialism and the people sitting on the right were the people who wanted to stay or go backwards and they were having a reaction to the process of the Revolution they were the right-wing and the reactionaries right that's where these terms develop the progressives and the left and the reactionaries and the right and so when we look at that and we apply that to the US of today they have to be General categories they can't be these particular descriptions of things based on characteristics that we freeze in time again and what I see is that the Trump movement is far more left Wing than every single you know hammer and sickle in their social media profiles liberal that they do is use Marx's name to say the same thing that the ruling class says right and this is the problem with uh the fake or what I call the fake left the journal that you mentioned at the beginning uh Journal of American Socialist studies that's the paper that I wrote for that it's called against the fake left because for a long time this is all we had in the US where these people who knew nothing about Marxism yet lied to us and tell told us they did uh doing the work of the ruling class from their class position in the middle class right looking down on the entire working class who of course rejected them of course they did because they were being spat down upon called racist and homophobic and bigoted and they make up a new one every single day even when now sometimes it's true an individual could have some bigger deut but that's not their defining element that what what what creates what they are in a political manner in regards Society what really matters is that class position right so uh uh uh I don't know go ahead I'm gon to get off on a whole big rant if I keep going and I don't want to uh disrespect your time no no you no this is our time you know what I mean that's why I invited you all on here no this is really what I I knew it was going to be this good I mean it always is when I'm watching you guys do your thing I'm learning you know from afar like I was send you off camera and I just think that people need to be a little bit more receptive I mean that's not asking a lot but everything you're saying Rings true with the political discourse with just the red Ive elements are progressive and um reactive and and that's going back to you know 1788 1789 and it like people are still kind of stuck in this left right I mean it's it's honestly ridiculous at this point and I think a lot of is just the reaffirmation of one's views and once they get reaffirmed so much they just get so accustomed to them to me that has to be CU these are really good people man I just think a lot of it is people love the confirmation bias um and once that confirmation bias is attached to hierarchy it becomes even more dangerous whether it's a university whether it's a pastor and and we see all these tangible examples because they want to gravitate oh my gosh this person is the leader this pastor you go to the black church everyone listens to what the pastor saying this person person is a leader of authority this is an authoritative figure and people are just so used to that I'm but that takes the power from everyone else like we have to see information as that's our information no not one person holds the information so why are we doing that like okay we got to copy this person copy that person that person doesn't have any sort of authority over your thought process you're allowing them to have that authority over your process and I just um maybe that's just too simple for people to I don't know it's pretty frustrating the times we live in and you think we would have learned from now the dangers of binaries but it seems like we're more polarized than ever now let let me just say real quick I'm sorry Carlos I know I'm stepping on you I'll be quick I promise um yes that is the case but if you remember what we were talking about in the beginning what drives progress It's necessity there's something about society as it is that cannot go on in the old way and we have a new real left-wing movement in this country now and it's not just the American Communist party but I like to think this is a large focal center of it uh go ahead sorry yeah I you mentioned something there Kiko which is um interesting the way that people just blindly follow um the The Authority that they're connected to in whatever specific Community they're in whether it's the University or the church you know thinking is scary thinking uh being a free thinker thinking on your own which is profoundly human it's what genuine thinking is about because if not you're just memorizing or appealing to Authority but genuine thinking is scary um the German philosopher Emanuel K in one of his most uh provocative articles and insightful ones uh he asked what is Enlightenment uh um and he says a a a a modotto from Latin sap AI which means dare to know you know dare to autonomously uh think on your own and uh not just let the thoughts that you have in your head be the product of someone else's uh you know thinking you know think freely think on your own dare to do that and that's that's scary uh for some people and you know the Paradox is we're taught that what Communists want is people to think uniformly and and to be the complete opposite of freethinkers right but it's actually as most of anti-communist propaganda it's actually the opposite you know uh our hope is that people can actually think freely you know the the Ministry of Education in the Soviet Union that was headed by Anatoli lunacharsky it was uh labeled the ministry of Enlightenment because of how in line with that conception of Enlightenment uh the Communists have always been I just had to give a speech at our party's National Convention uh two weekends ago the central essence of my speech as the Secretary of Education of the party is not hey you guys have to remember all of the readings and everything marks and Engle said and everything that I sent you through no it was the the the core the locus of what it means to be a Marxist leninist for us is the ability to think freely and critically and creatively when you have a new problem that presents itself to you don't be going back to see what Marx wrote in a completely different context and see how you can foist it onto this new problem no think about the problem at hand creatively and freely so um in a way and and this might seem um uh you know contradictory with everything American people have heard about communism but what we want the American people to do is to be able to rise up uh out of the dogmatisms that various forces in our society impose on them and to think on their own we don't want to force anyone to think a specific way we want them to think freely and we believe that on the basis of thinking freely they'll see that communism is common sense and something you all said too about this I understand the proximity with the magga people like I've said this a lot of times on different episodes and people just they think it's just some kind of a unfounded theory that I have but I see it in everyday life it's not I just don't think people are around those people enough to really understand and judge it correctly they automatically and you see it on X all the time x honestly I don't know how much social media is going to be detrimental to the to people's causes in the future but X is so toxic because you would see people on that say you far love people just like the far right people you guys are just like the fascist and like they they compare the two together like you see it all the time oh my gosh you sound just like them that's like that's is that the only like go-to that people have like it's got to be more complicated than that it can't just be oh they're really this when you pull the blanket off of their face do you want to hear something crazy uh half of the the the posts that I make or The Institute makes or whatever uh the comments are literally like people who consider themselves leftists like like liberals basically and then neo-nazis arguing over why we're bad right we're we're too brown or we're too white or whatever it is uh it's the crazy thing we've seen this alignment of forces because of that toxicity and the need to turn one thing into something other in order to sort of posit yourself as somehow Superior to it we've seen the literal neo-nazis and liberals teaming up once again against the Communists uh and this is sort of the way it always plays out this is just a new form it's playing out in in the social media era um look it's like I was saying this the other day and and I jokingly Carlos hates that I do this but I jokingly refer to them as Wizards Wiz yeah because they believe that by uttering these magic words they can change what reality is Right casting magic spells at us I make a whole joke out of but it's very dumb like I said earlier I have a very stupid sense of humor but it's what they do you could say Kiko I love I love dogs and and you know if this were X you'd be writing a 10 poost Thread about how you can't believe how much I hate cats and how I'm evil for hating cats when all I was I love dogs well now in this in this social media climate hell dare find a way to associate you with Trump with that with the cast and the dogs a dog how are you believe me I know brother and the thing is that I mean if we think a little bit critically about this because you know um X has allowed a lot of you know quite scary voices to come back in to public discourse people like Nick Fuentes I don't say this as a you know some some leftist uh Twitter head or or something but that guy is racist he is anti-Semitic and he's the biggest gift we can give to the Zionist entity today because the way the Zionist entity legitimates his genocide is oh everything is anti-Semitic everyone who opposes us is anti-Semitic so you up a voice that is actually anti-semitic and you make it one of the you try to make it one of the faces of anti-zionism uh it feeds into what the Zionist entity needs which is anti-semites but one of the things that we have been focused on ever since these people came back in because we understand how in periods of Crisis it's very easy to find some Pariah group that people blame instead of the system we've been focusing on attacking these people on challenging them on waging the Battle of ideas against them on you know asking them to debate us some of them have been very scared Nick Fuentes has you know regardless of how many times we've asked him to debate he's never wanted to debate any of us he says we're not big enough in terms of followers some of us have 100,000 followers some of us have 300,000 that's not big enough and it's the same size as you whatever but the point is we've been attacking these people waging the fight against the actual fascists people who actually like uh Hitler and what have the leftists been doing because we're attacking them they're calling us fascist they're say that we are platforming them or or any other stupid term that they come up with so in the same places will we will be attacking the fascist here come the leftists to call us fascist just the other day we had a comrade in Carbondale part of the Illinois chapter the American Communist Party someone who spent uh the last two months handing out uh preventative medical supp supplies for an area that was affected by Lyme disease because a lot of the people in that area like going hiking and there's a bunch of ticks in the park I myself have gotten some of them and because it's where I lived for like four or five years and this kid that's you know it's literally doing the Lord's work preventing people from getting sick gets approached by a six trans individual named Cassandra who harasses him in their local cases and who says that hat that you have on your head that says ACP is basically a swatsa hat oh wow so the party that has actually had the excuse my French the coonis to go ahead and attack the Nazis head on because the leftist don't even want to participate in the fight now we're the ones that are the Nazis in the eyes of these people it's completely uh delusional so what we see is precisely that alignment that Noah mentioned that's the real horseshoe Theory it's the Liberals that call everyone of fascist and the actual fascist when they're United and attacking the people that are communist and serving their communities and fighting against imperialism and trying to unite the American people around important bread and butter issues uh they're fascist as well as much as the the the explicit fascist because they're doing their work who historically whether it's in Germany or in Italy who historically during the periods of capitalist crisis such as the one that we are in today where the Stormtroopers the extra legal uh organized bodies that would attack Communists and threaten them and and and threaten to kill them those the fascist but today the people doing that are yes the explicit fascist and also the leftist you have the so-called leftist for sure and um I just this conversation has definitely been enriching and we're going to keep going and something that you all mentioned before the adjacent nature of ACP I think Noah made the comment about the other organizations and parties already here which leads to my question so you have the American Communist party you all founded that right with a bunch of other people I I I want to get to that in a second but you mentioned communist part of USA is there no communist part of USA anymore and I'm thinking too we have the green party PSL party of socialism and Liberation um PP Peace and Freedom Party you have all these left leaning or left so-called left parties why not build the infrastructure from within them what made you all go into the decision like we got to create the American Communist Party um well let me get to the old Communist party in a minute all these all of these groups groups that have been around for a few decades um are the ones that have been attacking us nonstop uh before we even formed the party the The Institute reached out to every single one of them let's do something together let's we have this huge following like come on our platform like tell us what organizing you're doing Etc they spit at us and there's only so many times uh that that that can happen until it begins to get suspicious right um they have had decades upon decades upon decades to do something that matters to actually change a single thing and they seem either incapable or unwilling to do that when George Floyd was murdered by this by the state we had the largest protest demonstrations in all of American History all of these groups combined could not get a single thing changed to me that means they are a failure we need something new our idea originally was well what was the vehicle for change back when that happened it was the Communist Party the the the party that was historically connected to the entire world communist movement right the Communist Party of of America of the USA the party of Henry Winston the party of William Z Foster and web de boys and these heroic figures of stature of Claudia Jones and a strong right so we we go to this and we find out that it's just as bad if not worse uh filled with middle class liberals that have no idea what Marxism is but still we stayed we said no we need to respect this historical organization let's try we were one by one blackballed uh smear campaigns lie campaigns the entire uh leadership that's saying the same thing they were saying 40 years ago about the Republicans being a fascist threat and this being the most important election of Our Lifetime right literally obs obsessed about a media Collective for months and went through their ranks uh isolating people creating a a a sort of paralyzing atmosphere where you couldn't even tell people you were actually a Marxist you had to say the correct woke magic words and be a wizard right change reality with them um and then you were okay the minute you go into Marxist analysis of any that was a giveaway that you could be you know some secret infrared infiltrator this culminates at their last uh convention and now is where I'll get to the old party during their last convention the uh what we call them in Marxism is Renegades people who say they uh support Marxism who are in some historical organization but betray the working class on behalf of the ruling class the Renegade in leadership specifically a man named Joe Sims forced through a resolution that would actively Force the members of the party to do everything they can spend all their time and energy and money getting Democrats elected at a time when Democrats are responsible for a genocide this caused a huge explosion of push back within the party as you could expect no if I can add there just real quick yeah yeah yeah that the the operational methodology of communist parties is something called dialect I mean Democratic centralism right which in essence means that before you make a decision you have a process of democratic consultation and debate and whichever side wins out and gets the majority everyone even the people that were initially against it have to unite there has to be Unity of action because we realize that in unity there is strength but we need the Democratic component we need to be able to have that consultation for the Communist Party USA that convention is the main area where the Democratic consultation is supposed to take place that's where chapters from around the country send their guy their delegate in order to put forth the perspective of that chapter and debate and there was one resolution that was the only one that was even worth debating cuz all the other ones everyone agreed on it was very basic stuff but that one resolution five on whether they were going to continue supporting the Democrats they had a vote on it before that vote there was supposed to be an area of debate 50 people signed up to debate against that resolution none of them were allowed the five people that were allowed to debate were people that were handpicked by the leadership and who were in favor of the resolution so that was a violation then there's a vote and the vote is oral so it's yay or nay the yay is completely outweighed and we have evidence we talk to all of the delegates that were there they completely outweighed the Nay but what did leadership do we can't tell which one won so what did the Kadri do the people said okay if you can't tell through y or nay let's actually vote so you can count the votes they said no which was another violation because when that uh when someone requests that constitutionally there supposed to accept it so what ends up happening when the leadership calls it a tie it ends up going to a body that is fully controlled by the leadership where the decision is made basically by the proxies of the leadership who want to continue supporting the Democrats and eventually that uh body voted in favor of the resolution and of continuing to support the Democrats imagine what ended up happening is that all of the cadres all of the delegates that were there that were cheated of the one chance that they had to have some actual democracy in the party which is constitutionally required some of them ended up passing around a petition where they said okay maybe let's be good faith about it maybe there wasn't time to discuss but let's discuss now and then let's let's do it let's create a forum to discuss this question and let's actually uh vote on it in a serious Democratic manner do you know what happened to the people that made the petition and the hundreds of cadres and even whole chapters that signed on to it they were were purged they were kicked out of the party for asking that the party live up to what the party said it's supposed to be doing so on that basis on that breach of democratic centralism and of the party Constitution we realize that okay it's one thing being a party that says it's communist but not actually communist and you fight within it and if there's the procedures that they claim to be in place you can actually change it at some point but once the procedures themselves have been nullified because constitutions have been violated and Democratic centralism has been violated there's nothing left in the party so the people that participated the Democratic base the Grassroots of the party that were cheated in that 32nd National Convention they're the ones that now reconstitute the party because they are the party as the American Communist party we sorry and it in and it includes this other party existed which was the party of Communists that left in the 90s for similar reasons 80% of that party the day we launched quits and joins our party and that's basically what the Communist the American Communist party is yeah I I just want to say we as in Carlos Eddie me H Jackson the the plenary committee for the new party the reconstitution of the same Communist party we simply happen to be in a position where all of these people trusted us to bring them together and bring that legitimate infrastructure of the old party that we say is liquidated and and gone uh with them right and reorganize it put it into a new form uh but it continues the same Mission as the old part on on a sort of higher stage of development to use a Marxist jargon you know thanks for clearing that up that makes total sense we actually oh I'm sorry I have a bad habit of interrupting otation about this process so that's on our website if you ever want to read it I think it it really gives all the details of how that happens no I'm definitely going to link all the information in the episode description and that does make sense because I'm not going to throw too many people under the bus um on this channel like at least I want to say that I've been pretty like ethical and honest up until this point because some people will coming up to me I'm not even going to lie it was about eight months ago and I was talking to a woman in the coffee shop and she said you know you're a journalist right Kiko because she saw me in the coffee shop I just didn't know who this person was and she said you're you're a teacher aren't you I was like yeah how you know that she's like I can tell I can tell and so we got to talking and I told her yeah like I'm a professor like I've taught on and off do some freelance work now and she said that it's just it's just something about the way you were you know explaining the things to people and and I could kind of grab onto that and I'm kind of losing my train of thought but it has something to do with what we discussed as far as the parties so this is where it goes to it goes to the parties um the reluctance of some people to to kind of meet you halfway and I know you all have had that issue you just explained that you've had that issue with people trying to meet you halfway but then they Proclaim to be something else and that's and that's another thing that I've had to learn in this media landscape is um the people that you think that they are aren't what they always seem you know when you actually you know meet them and it's not really it's not throwing people under the bus it's just it kind of C me by surprise and then and it's unfortunate too because it kind of goes back to like television again you know what you see on television isn't always it's a simulation it's a similation of something and this is almost becoming that in ways and there are authentic voices there I don't want to say that but there is definitely a propensity to have this simulation world within this world that we're trying to navigate through because I I honestly believe that some people just ended to make the money they're not in it to push any movement um organization they're not trying to mobilize people and and and get things done they're not trying to do that they're in this is like a business venture for them that's what it is let me tell you something about the old party they are sitting on top of millions upon millions of dollars of real estate they also at this last convention failed to give a financial statement which is another thing in their constitution uh and so I I can't you know make any claims but it seems to me that Joe Sims flying first class around the country might be uh while they're you know crying poor mouth and getting donations from their members and their Rank and pile just to keep the uh website that they call the paper going uh I don't know a little suspicious to me but look I think that um Carlos tells me this all the time that I expect people to be better than they are um I try to give everyone the benefit of the doubt I treat them the way I would assume I would act right uh and I'm constantly disappointed what the the millu were coming out of this middle class sort of really sleazy uh uh quote unquote left uh people are will do anything to take you down once you do not you know Kiss the Ring or you know mouth the right magic connotation or or whatever right uh and that's what they we've experienced with them since then I'm not we used to stay quiet about it uh but at the end of the day look we're peaceful people like any communist but we're at the point where they brought this fight to our door and so we're going to finish it I want to just add a joke uh there um in terms of the interaction the sort of people that we're forced to interact with in the left um this joke comes from someone who um I've criticized a whole lot in in my work but who nonetheless has some rational colel slavo shesek um which I know Noah is going to be pissed if me citing him but uh he has this joke where this uh Genie goes to uh the balcons and he ask uh he tells a guy hey you know you can um ask me to do whatever for you I'll do it but the catch is I'll do it twice to your neighborhood so whatever whatever I do for you your neighbor gets twice as much and what the guy says is okay take off one of my eyes you know so the point is not um you know to have a positive good for oneself but to have a negative for the other and that's how the left operates and the the Twitter left the so-called left they don't want something good or productive to be done by them they just want to see everyone else sink and uh you know that mentality only gets you so far I mean it'll work for The Silo of people that are in that very sad resentful state but for the general population who actually have real concerns about their life and who need you know the bread and butter concerns uh in that life addressed it's not going to work for them I wonder how much of it is because I mean we went over this already right that they've failed if the if the actual Improvement of living conditions is their goal they've failed and so the the the the American Communist party is reconstituted and suddenly we're succeeding where they've tried for decades and done nothing I wonder how much of it is based on that need to try to delegitimize us because they're sort of in this stage where their failure makes themselves even if they don't want to look at it like that look at themselves like professional uh amateurs right or or proverbial amateurs rather no I'm not going to spend too much time on this but it's definitely something that's always in my mind and I know that once this form continues to grow the thing about us we we honestly don't give a damn who we encounter because I I reached out to pretty much I reach out to anybody it doesn't matter to me at this point you have nothing to lose reaching out to people people ask me why did I reach out to people like Trump and and RFK and I'm like you don't know what I have to ask them first of all and it's just like there's always a reason why I bring people on is not just simply oh I'm going to look through my black book and choose these people I mean there's obvious a reason that I have these people on the show and I think that's part of the Mystique of the show is that you never know who's going to be on the show but but there is a purpose behind it and the purpose is honestly like ultimately we need to find a way to organize and and do things together and I believe that we can do things together I know we will it's just a matter of getting people I have to be able to optimize that crowd I can't just say those people aren't willing to get on train because I won't know until I at least ask those people and some people and this is a stage some people I know the stage I was at when I was 18 years old like my dad is my largest political influence when I was an 18 year old liberal I was pretty open-minded as an 18y old but I had so much to grow like I knew then I know there's way more to the world than what there is in front of me right now and now been 42 years old I've that but when I'm 50 it's going to be even there's going to be even more room to grow and I just think people sometimes don't get themselves Room to Grow they just automatically I don't know why they boss themselves in like that but they do and I see it all the time and like you said this this Twitter left or whatever it is that's why I'm very particular about who I invite on the show because I just I don't know if people are trying to sabotage movements or what but it's just I feel like at some point like that has to be some kind of sabotage element involved because you have to know that you're pissing people off when you do that kind of stuff like on these social media platforms Kiko remember when we said earlier that dialectical thinking is just common sense that's it you know that's that's uh you talking about your life and constant growth and that's dialectical Thinking by the way but look we you know I did uh recently a few months ago an article of self-critique um because we've been at this as an Institute for five years um we've seen a lot of growth and good numbers but um I I think one of the most valuable things for an organization or for an individual is being able to look back and see where was I wrong um and and how can I even publicize it so that others who might be in that path um can learn from my experience we came into the scene with the thought that okay we're looking at these different organizations on the lab we're looking at what they say about themselves and on that basis we see that there's more commonality and difference and our goal is almost to bring all of these different lefts together and I have articles explicitly saying like why doesn't PSL and the cpusa and the F frso and all these different organizations if they have nine10 in common and one1 in difference why don't they come together and as Noah mentioned we extended our fraternal hands to all of these organizations for years and if the hand was ever not shaken it's because the one that rejected was the other one not ours so that forces me to think well if people in these spaces some of them are very good people but if at least the leadership the ones in charge of the trajectory and the structures of these organizations if they're of the nature that whenever there's an attempt at Unity they're the ones that bring forth the cancel culture and the smear Ing and the talking behind people's backs is that the sort of unity we should be seeking you know what happens when you unite fire with water is it good for the fire is it good for the water no it just dissipates both and what we ended up finding was that in this attempt to search for some sort of pan leftist Unity what it leads is futility it's just this sort of cancel culture that is it's it's the reason in part why there hasn't been any successful leftist uh movement in in decades and decades in the US so we have to even interrogate we know the ruling class seeks to divide because they control through dividing the vi in parot famous old dictum that all the powerful have understood very well and when they've lost it's because they forgot this dictum but the unity that we have to counter that with we also have to critically interrogate because we don't want Unity between fire and water because it dissipates the fire of the struggle that we're involved them the unity that we must search for is unity of the people uh because those are the ones that make history not various different political factions it's the people that are getting involved uh that make history so I did an article recently called the dialectics of unity in the left where I said you know I was wrong you know we were wrong and this is what experience has taught us and the focus on Unity that we have now is a Unity based in the people not in these various different lefts that at the end of the day by promoting Unity with them you're actually promoting the facto more disunity more Division I think uh just to add on to that really quick look the the fake left abandon the working class not the other way around and we see uh through understanding Marxism and even just our our own lives that these fake leftists aren't a revolutionary agent the revolution doesn't happen when we can get everyone to agree to you know tiptoe around everyone's microaggressions and and points of privilege and everyone has to check their privilege and do whatever that's not when Revolution happens Revolution happens when the working class is unable to live in the old way and it's forced into motion and in order to do that it has to become conscious of what it is and bite in its own interest and so we say that there is a new LA and it's the the reconstituted Communist party it's the American Communist party and it's not just us there are others right um but the goal isn't to unite with all of these decaying old elements of the pre-2020 it's to unite with the working people of this country that need change I like that and in this same vein I tell you this conversation is going a lot longer than I thought I can tell because we've covered so much stuff and there's a lot more to cover and I'm thinking about this word capitalism so that comes from Marxism right that word it is from Marx and angles correct unless you talk to a Libertarian and then it's like a historical in the C [Laughter] yeah yeah it's in uh in the work of for instance someone like uh Adam Smith you don't see capitalism you you see uh even the term capitalist wasn't employed there it was like industrialist or even Master because he was already connecting the capitalist master in a sense to like the slave master but yeah the popularization of the term comes from uh uh the Marxist basically it comes it comes from Marx's theory of what capital is basically so is that the reason why in popular culture the term isn't used for people that are capitalist they don't refer to themselves that way because if you notice whenever there's a smear it's always you're radical you're far-left you're a Marxist you're a communist you're a socialist but you never hear people say that they're capitalist themselves is there a reason for that even though it's part of the same lexicon I I do see some people say it's such um um like political pundants or or some Libertarians where they're like you know I agree with a lot of what you're saying even though I'm a capitalist and they think of capitalism as an identification with the system in reality like all that capitalism really is is capital ISM it's a society where the most Supreme value what matters the most the whole purpose of everything else everything else ends up being englobed in this one purpose of capital accumulation because Capital itself capital is not this cup or some money in my pocket money can turn into Capital everything can potentially turn into Capital because capital is a relation a relation of accumulation that's what capital is so when you talk about a system uh based on that you have capitalism and it's a system where the whole purpose of everything is how can we accumulate more and more Capital not how can we create better conditions for people not how can we even allow the rich to uh be very greedy uh people and have as as much possible in their savings uh as possible because that's not Capital if you just got money uh in in your savings if you just have a load of cash in a room that's not Capital that's money but it's not Capital because it's not being used for accumulation so uh you know um I'm I'm forgetting what the original question was but the what capitalism is is not having markets as people you know often Bon Misa says you know you either have a socialist society or markets no there's been markets in slave societies and fudal societies and socialist societies markets are just an Institutional form that decide how we distribute things but how we distribute things is based on how we produce them and the purpose for how uh we're producing so yes there's capitalist markets but that's not what makes capitalism capitalism what makes capitalism capitalism is not the ideas of of of specific uh sectors of society but it's this real movement this real trajectory of what is it that's going to govern the movement of society the accumul of capital or something else as soon as you have something else you can't be talking about capitalism you're talking about something completely distinctive when another value that's not the accumulation of capital is put to the Forefront you don't have capitalism you have something else and this is I I appreciate the explanation by the way that makes a lot of sense and that's the reason why I didn't want to go down the rabbit hole of we we understand why the terminology is used the way it is and this um the circus right now it's ridiculous the way they Brainwashed the country KLA Harris is elst she's she's a communist and and I actually posted a question on Facebook today to um my people that follow me and said two Harris supporters give me five reasons why you you support Harris without mentioning Trump fascism Hitler anything and I said the same thing to Trump supporters give me five reasons why you support him without mention mening communism far any of that I've gotten two responses so far and guess what they're both in my family one send a DM and one was but and they were both black obviously it just I just there's something going on with that too even with that the way people preserve their beliefs and I'm saying said why are you hiding the when people are confronting you directly about it but you can put on here on your your Facebook Harris and Waltz you can put that on there all day you only have one choice like all my liberal friends are putting that on their profiles you only have one choice like make sure you're smart but you can't participate in a poll I mean like I'm trying to get real information and I'm not going to judge you like DM me if you don't want people to see your dumb choices I mean I don't care about them but just I mean it's a dumb choice and I tell you why like face to face but I'm not going to do it to you in front of millions of people but it's just interesting how people guard their values at their convenience and so the question is are they really proud of those choices and those decisions are they or they trying to convince you that of something because I I think it's an interesting psychology going on there are you familiar with George Carin yeah yeah there's this one joke that he makes that's like uh the American political Consciousness where um one front ask the other you know who who are you going to vote for and why and the the guy says no how dare you ask me such an intimate question well anyway so I was my wife on missionary yesterday and then they just get into talking about these very vulgar topics of intimate sex and all these different things but we can't talk about who we're voting for why and all these different things here's my thing um how what's the percent of of the American people right now that even see the the the voting process itself as legitimate that think our government is actually functioning for us it's very very low I think most people that vote uh do so because they're middle class and and they have no necessity to improve their lives so they can sit here and worry about communist kamla Harris or fascist Donald Trump and at the end of the day both of them are running solely solely on I'm not the other one exactly right um I mean Trump had a some potential at first right 2016's Trump was talking about locking up Hillary Clinton and and draining the swamp and bringing production back and I was sort of quietly optimistic like okay let's see where this goes but he went the same place it always does right nowhere and so I think we're in this period where more and more people are realizing that it's all uh a a a pade it's all a mirage it's all a distraction and those who still care don't even really know why they care anymore it's sort of just a habit a routine and as this process that I call repr proletarianization or the death of The Middle classes continues on the same thing will be happening to them uh that is unless they're you know safely and sconed in what tiny amount of a middle class we're going to have in the future but they're going to realize at some point the only reason I cared was because I I I'd cared in the past that's what my prediction the Liberals would shoot me for saying this but Trump is another form of Obama you know someone who got the masses hyped up and uh who uh came up getting a lot of people hopeful for a radical change and that just gave them a big old nothing Burger when he was actually in office and just governed like everyone else before them and uh you know we we went from a trump that said I'm G to be the anti-war president to a trump that says let's bomb Iran and their nuclear facilities and and basically escalate to a nuclearized thirdd World War let's continue you know I'm going to let Israel finish the job what 250,000 Palestinians dead according to the Lancet report um it's it's absolutely disgusting uh there as as George Galloway is is fond of saying they're two cheeks of the same ass and this is something too that I want some of my friends to kind of debunk is or not demystifying their mind they have to Justified this thought process I always viewed Trump as just he's part of he's a tool obviously he's simply a tool and I've always seen him as a Democrat from day one like he's always been a Democrat like if you look at these people's histories I don't know why people are so if you look at marer Taylor green Carrie Lake Lauren boubert all these people were Democrats it makes total sense to me but these people are so delusional how these people they're far right now I'm like no they're not they're they're using their positioning as a way to get into system that's all Trump is is a tool like he's nothing more people by them saying that they're scared of him actually adds more to the problem that's why I'm tried to tell people you giving him more credit than what he needs than what he deserves like he's not this like formidable Force I mean you guys are making him that like he's not some kind of a formidable Force but maybe I'm just on the other side of it I don't know but I just try to get people like maybe they just don't see what we see but I just think that they've created the monster and now they're trying to blame everybody else that have been T you all along the me y'all did that yourselves the high Piper strategy you elevated him you thought that he was going to self-destruct it backfired on you the personality got you know flamed went into the masses the masses liked it that flavor of the day which was the different flavor with the same flavor of bush and neoliberalism but it was the neoliberalism that people were wanting but and when you play those neoliberal games you get burned by them and and that's exactly I think Trump is pretty much part of that tradition look I think I think people liked Trump because he took the mask off right the the reason he began getting famous was in that discussion with Hillary Clinton right here where he's like I know you don't pay taxes because I use the same loopholes and everybody was like he said the quiet power out loud we all knew this finally someone who's telling it like it is right and from that moment forward people just trusted him not remembering that you know he's kind of a reality TV clown right uh and then and this this is something that really made all my trump voting co-workers think once he got in office he governed pretty much like Obama yeah it was almost the exact same nothing really he deported less people oh yeah there's that talk about the immigration issue I don't know why they use that like like they obviously I don't believe that they're trying to win I don't believe that the Democrat because they're going to win anyway because all they do is play off of each other like I've been trying to tell my friends this the Democrats and Republicans need each other that's the only way this system can survive just like the Zionist need the Nick Fuentes it's exactly it for the Democrats stuff like abortion is a political football they had time if they actually believed in you know in what they say they believe they could have codified it 30 years ago um they didn't do it uh the Republicans do they actually care about immigration or any of the things that they talk about hell no the people that fund the Republican party are the ones that benefit from the cheap labor of uh of of of of U non legal immigrants you know so both parties distract you from the bright and butter issues where they're both excuse my French uh you equally that's what my dad says by the way and and they they focus on these single issues that even those issues they're disingenuous about because they don't actually believe in what what they say they believe they need both of those issues to remain as issues so that they can say so that they can keep the boogeyman other as the person that's gonna either take away abortion rights or or allow immigrants to flood the Border if if if immigrants stop flooding the Border in the words of the Republicans or if uh abortion is codified in in the case of the Democrats what the hell are they going to run on here's here here's my thing a few years ago or maybe it's a few months ago there was a study from from Princeton that said that it empirically proved that the USA has no democracy at all that it has oligarchy and this went viral right uh because it resonated with people in what they already intuitively knew um and what Carlos is describing is what lennin once said was that every four years uh people in bouris society are allowed to choose who is going to exploit them and who is going to oppress them and that's what it is when is the last time the American people actually chose a candidate we are constantly forced to go oh this person might be less bad I believe we're in a period where less bad is no longer good enough where people are catching on to this because they've relied on it for too long I want to get this in because Noah may have to go shortly and then we can kind of you know close it up some and talk a little bit more about just ACP just a little bit more before he Clos out today I wanted to kind of bring up my literary background because it's kind of relevant into the discussion with Marxism communism and the way I was kind of introduced I wasn't introduced to Communism through the literature that I interpret and study because even in high school like I said when I was a liberal and even when I was going to college back way back when I was reading marks back then I was reading that stuff then I didn't quite this the ideas were like this person is a very smart person that's kind of what I got from it I didn't really contextualize it the way I needed to at the time and then when I got to the university you know I started reading all these black writers in Latin America um Amy C whether it's the frankophone writers Fon or whether it's somebody like adto Ortiz who was an afro Ecuadorian writer and all these people at some point had elements of um e either they were characters of Communism in their literature confronting like a black world this black localized world and um it was different than the Caribbean it was different than the southern cone it was different in South America Central America just depending on where these people were and you're dealing with all these intersectional elements of the Blackness and the geography and everything else but the part that interested me the most is when these sub marxists kind of um they ReDiscover themselves and kind of question their own literary Productions like like a j Stefan Alexis from Haiti who wrote mik Soul which um which is like General son my brother if you translate that to English even though it was written originally in French and cray and he's talking about people then like the characters or from like poverty like abject poverty black protagonists from AEP poverty and they don't know anything about communism they don't know anything about it the only way these characters are introduced to it is through um they would be more boua guess but they're impr prisoned because of their politics at the time like and these are fictional writers but these people are in prison because they're Communists so he's getting education from these Communists that he meet in prison this um protagonist for instance but the whole novel and these series of novels kind of question this idea of Blackness and relating that to to Communism and how that's there's a friction there because even though the ideas sound good they always trade is like these are ideas that you see in the books these are ideas that you see in fantasy novels how does that relate to my um my Haitian my blackness and it it kind of deals with this Haitian revolution meets the French Revolution meets communism is kind of questioning everything that we've been taught about these things and I always wonder where does Pana africanism fall into this because there's definitely a dialogue between all these different IDE but the way the black writers confronted is interesting to me because it's not that that's shooting down communism completely it's just that they always tend to go back to pre-communist like like the Middle Passage or whether it was the formation of the kbos in the 1500s it's always like a very localized like that's the only way we can do it it has to be communal it has to be super localized it can't be something that's a broader type of ideology I don't know if any of that makes sense or not but I'm just kind of I'm trying to capture what these people are writing and also my interpretation of what they're writing it does um I I'll be quick caros uh I think that there that having grown up in a mostly black neighborhood there is a sort of uh narrative that communism is a white people thing I mean that's the what I've straight up been told many times uh but communism is a universal thing uh and in the context of America it we call the father of American Marxism web Deo right um there is no American Marxism without understanding Duo and the black Freedom struggle there's no American people without Black America right the black America the black working class specifically brings the entire nation forward actualizing us further developing us as a a whole people not just at one revolutionary moment but two right at the end of the Civil War which creates the first ever dictatorship of the proletarian in history and then during the Civil Rights Movement which is another revolutionary transition to smash and throw down Jim Crow uh go ahead I don't want to go up on a ramble no yeah that analysis that Noah is referring to um based on the work of duo in our analysis of his role as the foundation of American Marxism I develop it in the last book for those interested um why we need American Marxism and it's very interesting because even in the academy part of what you get in the people that are presented as radical is this conception that you know Marxism is not radical enough it's European it's white Etc um um and it couldn't be more uh the contrary Russia was considered a white Nation for most of its history but do you know what the most white supremacist writers in the US and in the West in general said when uh Russia had the Bolshevik Revolution they became black they're no longer white they basically lost their white card yeah you could go back to uh uh the writings of some of these racist white supremacist thinkers and in their eyes communism was identical with uh the negation of their conception of whiteness that's why even here when the marthi period what do they call and there's pictures of this of of racist protesters what did they call Race mixing they called race mixing communism right so the ideology of Defending capitalism has always been intimately connected with the need to otherize some group and uh in as as a reflection back from that otherization of positing some sense of whiteness as intimately connected to humanity so I think that the one of the things that we actually see de facto historically is that things like pan-africanism have always been developed within the context of um not only a critique of Communism but an alignment with with Communism and not only a critique of capitalism but an alignment with Communism the person who develops pan africanism is Du someone who dies uh while being a member of the Communist Party the country he died at Ghana was a socialist country allied with the Soviet Union most of the main anti-colonial revolutionaries whether it's cabal or um Sara whoever it might be in Africa they're deeply panafrican is ncuma um and they were Communists you know but communist in the National and and civilizational context of African reality and this just goes back to what we you know we talked about in a previous interview and that I referenced briefly and in this one communism or socialism is always embedded in a specific form and pan-africanism in the way that it has been formulated all it really is is socialism with African characteristics um and that analysis is itself a Marxist analysis and uh you know what makes some Marxism as to go back to what a point that Noah made is not people calling themselves that right someone can call themselves a Marxist but in their analysis of the world they have nothing to do with Marxism and then there's people that cannot call themselves Marxism can just call what they're doing Pana africanism but in reality what they're doing is Marxism and that's a whole lot of what we find in the anti-colonial Revolutions in the global South and specifically in Africa and that's why when they come together with the communist it's like holy it's kind of the same thing except that uh we developed it specifically out of our context and in my opinion that proves the correctness of Communism when people who are not trained necessarily on the literature of Marx angles Lennon Etc spontaneously arrive through their own very own realities and struggles at those ideas so you know in that context where you call it pan-africanism or communism you know call it whatever you want it is for the people that are aware of the tradition it is communism so that's how I've I've always thought of uh that tradition and in the US it's essential because the main developments that our nation has had have been centered around the struggle against the color line Against Racism and this narrow conception that the social Democrats have of class struggle as just this thing that happens in the factories between white workers and their bosses that's ridiculous in marks in Engles and Lenin the struggles for national liberations are not just National Liberation struggles they're a form that the class struggle takes the struggle against slavery in the US South was not just a struggle against slavery it was a class struggle the form that the class struggle takes the struggle against apari in the context of the US After the cter revolution of 1876 and up until 1964 when you have that political revolution and the the JW abolition of of of apide that struggle is a class struggle just like in South Africa the struggle against apide was a class struggle what are we going to say that Mandela was only uh uh someone who was engaged in race Struggle No it was the form that the class struggle took in the context of AP paride because that's what capital needed in order to succeed in its ends it needed to have uh people divided um to have poor working-class people divided and fighting each other over a race Marx calls racism the secret through which the capitalist class sustains its power so when you fight Against Racism this bifurcation artificial bifurcation of work class people on the basis of race what are you fighting if not the class struggle that's interesting okay I just want to add that look I can call myself a pizza it doesn't make me a pizza right I have to actually be a pizza in reality that reality is always primary right and our thoughts are only reflections of every moment leading up to that thought being cognized one pretty big philosophical um thing that I wanted to get off my chest before we conclude with ACP and Noah probably had to go soon but I want to get in this before Noah left so where do you all view like decentralization this is a word that I've heard I've never heard this word used so much in the last probably two years whether it was a guest people who um study political economy political Theory I hear this word decentralization been thrown around left and right from Libertarians from socialists from I'm saying myself everyone's using the same word so I I want to ask you guys like where does what does Marx what does he comment on decentralization and does that play any part at all into Marxism and all like like what is the line because I've always gotten the impression that that was more Anarchist but I may be off on that though um well here's the thing most people you'll hear talking about decentralization either for or against it don't have a realistic view of what it is because in order to actually have a decentralized anything you must have a a centralized system on another level it has to be both that it takes say a strong communist state to develop a decentralized system where businesses small businesses can flourish by popping up locally um at the same time in order to create that strong centralized communist state it must be built in order to M build up that centralization it must be built from the locals up up from the ground up so it takes at the same time as it takes decentralization to create centralization it takes centralization to De to create decentralization and this is one of the things we mean by contradictions existing in reality already right that this is all a process of these things happening right building it up in order to continue building it on another level uh and most people think you know like I'm a Libertarian I just dogmatically want things decentralized because I think that's or just or whatever they don't really have a concept of how to arrive there right what what have Libertarians ever actually done in the US about as much as m what Malay seriously I guess the AR treasury to the Federal Reserve the that's that's usually the approach that we take to most questions the way we're taught to think is again separating stuff centralization here and then this unbridgeable gulf decentralization here that doesn't make any sense right even the I mean let's let's look at the word itself decentralization what are you decentralizing from a Center so decentralization already implies a center and a center implies that which is not Central that which is decentralized at the very level of even the linguistic Dynamic of the terms you can't separate it from the other because they only obtain their meaning through that other and what we see in the reality of the construction of Communist States or even in the reality of a Communist Party such as the one that uh we're in and and that we're leaders for is this understanding of the inter dependency of decentralization and centralization in order for one to function effectively it needs the other to function effectively if there's too much decentralization not only does it affect the center but it affects the decentralized and if there's too much centralization not only does it affect the decentralized but also the center there needs to be a sort of dialectical equilibrium where for the success of one you need the success of the other and I think that's what we've seen in Communist States that uh because they're centralized they're also very much more decentralized right it is in people's China where you can go to your local communist officer if they're not doing what they're supposed to be doing and pull them out and scream at them and have these uh um you know people's uh protest events that are actually meaningful in ways that you can't do it in the US but it's because they have the centralization that it can also have a more effective uh uh decentralization so um again it's about how is it that we're thinking about opposites as mutually exclusive or as interdependent and our tradition sees them as interdependent and I think even if you look at the words itself it implies that interdependency no I promise I'm gonna let you go but since you're here I have to throw this nugget to the crowd because it's been brought to my attention and I was there the day this happened that someone that's been on my show a few times wants to debate you but they said that they will only do that if I'm the moderator and I said you know what I wasn't even going to bring this up but I believe that I would never entice this idea first of all because I've said that I've never seen a successful debate before the thing about my show is that I don't I want people to get something from it I don't want to be like a shooting match I want people to actually grow from the experience I believe I could do that I believe that I'm capable of pulling something like that off as a moderator um cuz I I'm really impartial I don't I don't have any agenda at stake I have nothing at stake when it comes to this and so I'm all about fairness giving people the opportunity to to debate dialogue converse with each other but someone is wanting to debate you I don't know exactly what the premise would be I think you said something about bring like I'll debate any leftist or something like that you put it on your ex profile and then and then back from the show Zack Heiden to Matt redneck someone who's been on my show before said I'll debate you like Kiko moderates it and so I said I have to talk to Noah about it I said you gotta give me time for this man like honestly because I've never done something like this before I'm not a big fan of this honestly I kind of have my hesitation but I said if we did it it had to be in January or something I have to think about it but I want to see where you feel or where you stand on that anyway before we continue well well I'll tell you what I I think I know what you're talking about and I I made a comment about how I have all of these fake leftists like constantly gibbering at me on X constantly like making wild claims and never and and I say hey I have a call-in show I do every Monday just call in let's talk about it right if you actually have something then you should be able to explain why it's correct and we can go back and forth right uh and not a single one is actually done that no no no I take that back one time I had Carlos on as a guest and someone tried to do that and Carlos was like like oh I'm taking this one so I never got a chance he cut me up on my own show that's hilarious what are you GNA do no but but see he's a lot smarter than so it's fine right so like uh I I jokingly call him like like the the L into my stalling right anyway um no no for real like I I'd be happy to do that um the problem is and I I've had a few people approach me with operas like this uh so I I think I know you're talking about but the problem is I am insanely busy like I'm going to be all over the country if not in other countries for the party uh I have conferences I have regular party work I have writing I have my sh like I have a lot going on so I tried to filter everybody like look if you have something to say call my show and I I dedicate those hours every week that's where I carve out a time to answer people's questions no matter what they are but if he wants something like more official and like I don't know I've never even done that but I'm happy to if that's what he wants to do if you want to do that I like you so I'm happy to like come back on the show just for that uh so yeah like it would just it might be hard scheduling for me so fair warning no problem we'll do it based on your availability because he's a stay-at-home dad so he's going to have the time and availability so we'll work it around your schedule and I think theot easier actually I think the reason why Z brought this up honestly is because he wanted it to go somewhere and I think he felt like this may be the vehicle to where that could go somewhere and that's the only reason why I would agree to do something like that I told him I was like I'm gonna have to have some time to think about this because I mean it's just something I'm really not a big fan of but it's a good way to kind of make me you know stand up do something and confront something because you're going to have to confront different things in this type of um organizational capacity so I I've thought about it enough and I feel more comfortable now just knowing you guys and and knowing him you guys are good people all you guys are good people I I think we could work it out look the way I see it all you need is good people um it no matter where you come from what tradition what dogmas what anything if you have good people putting their heads together then you can get something accomplished I agree with that I believe in that for sure but I don't know if you have to go now know I had to get that in before you got off camera because I know you got places to go but I got about 15 minutes before like I have have have to leave so oh we're good then we all get off at the same time then okay so ACP you mentioned H Jackson Hinkle I've seen these people like on I only know them through social media um so how do you all have a relationship anyway and how did all this come to ACP like who's in it how many what's the enrollment looking like all that stuff the um the other part um that came together to form the party very similar to the Midwest of marks Institute and with drove Eddie and I to create that uh Outlet had some critiques about the existing left and um it just so happened that a lot of the critiques were very very similar um there's Concepts that we have developed that they um you know when we introduce it to them they're like oh my God this is like the same thing uh we were also saying but um with a different term or something so there's uh oh okay so there's um there the the two groups were groups that developed in similar ways some areas there's the differences for instance infrared and ha had more of debate culture going um they grow out of the twitch uh streaming platforms but in terms of critiques of the left and how they visualized their project it was quite homologous to to ours um and this uh activity that we had going on within the Communist Party the old one where we were trying to change it democratically we realized you know quite quickly that it was both of us trying to change it democratically um and that we had agreements about how it had to be changed and towards what so that was the Locust for a point of unity and once we saw that it was impossible um through the existing means to do that it naturally um occurred for on the basis of the base of the party to reconstitute it and it was basically reconstituted on the basis of uh these two organizations that were the ones that brought people into uh the party uh the other important component of the party is um Christopher halali who is the international Secretary of the other party of Communists that basically 80% of it uh or so I've heard leaves to join our party he is and I I kid you not the most impressive individual I think I've ever met in my life uh someone who's been at War who's led a squadron of 40 men to war um who uh has six Master's degrees one of them in China who's finishing a jurist doctor and a doctorate in international relations in the most prestigious Russian University who's traveled the whole world and who knows some of the most impressive uh people ever who's been able to connect our party to more than 60 communist parties from around the world within like the first day he joined us um and who is currently running for office while he's doing all of this speaks like eight languages so I it's literally like an unbelievable individual he's been to like two League schools um so he comes in let me interrupt real quick not only that Chris is also the friendliest person you will ever meet when he's in the room you cannot help but be in a good mood y like he gets everybody like ready to work so it's a it's a those um those are the sort of three component uh parts of of of what forms the ACP um we launched on the day that Biden dropped out of the race I you know I I know Noah and I still remember very um uh very clearly the debates that we were having should we wait you know is is our our news of the launch going to be overshadowed by Biden and it was it was a real debate um and I'm happy to have been on the side that uh thought that you know we can ride this wave of Biden and to all of our surprise you know we're hoping for 250,000 views to all of our surprise the day that we launched we completely eclipsed the Biden news we became the most trending thing on Twitter for the next five days I was in Venezuela I was in Venezuela on an official invitation by the government as soon as we launched in Chicago and I was in Venezuela you know in day three and we were still the most trending thing on Twitter and it became replaced only by the Venezuelan elections which we got to trend on Twitter um so from even from the Inception we were able to show indeed that uh it's a qualitatively different type of party than anything the left I think has been used to not just in social media but in terms of the international relations they far surpass all of the other um self-proclaimed socialist organizations in terms of community work I mean our people have been able to uh change a lot of their communities uh they've made great connections with organizations on the grounds with churches and other groups said uh serve communities for Hurricane alen we raised more than $10,000 to help and we were on the ground while the US government was preventing people from helping our people were in there helping and giving supplies and aiding their communities um you know what we've done just in the last three months has been uh incredible and it's just a fraction of everything else that we have uh planned uh to do uh yeah it's been it's been wild um everything that uh we expected uh we tried to you know temper our expectations we know that there are you know I I mean the the history of the left wing in America is the history of the FBI it's a history of McCarthyism it's the history of infiltration and Co Intel Pro uh and we can't get ourselves that those forces just went away when the Soviets F they did not so we knew we would be attacked right off the bat but everything we've done so far has surpassed our wildest expectation uh the the 200,000 views thing um we we eclip that like immediately it got up to two million and this is because we think that people are ready for something new for a change for something that genuinely that I I think we have this issue of all the the self-proclaimed leftist organizations they create a community of their own of like-minded individuals from scratch and I'm not saying that's a bad thing this is a product of the hyper alienation of 21st century Bourgeois Society right but what they do once they create those is they come into other communities from outside as this alien creature and and say we are going to teach you we are the good ones come support us and we don't do that right we say look we live next door we're in the PTA with you right we're we're in the church with you we're already here we're Communists and we're the ones actively trying and succeeding in making this community a better place and in this we're stting starting in this decentralized bottomup mode right that comes together overall as one big thing as a centralized Communist Party project right um and we think that establishing these relations organically disproves all of the the the the misinformation and falsification about communism in this country because here's the thing what and this is what I've been doing at work forever right everyone in at work knows I'm a communist right they also know that I'm the guy that they can call if they have a problem with their project that I will stop what I'm I'll get my guys going stop what I'm doing and come help them fix their project if they have a guy call off I'm the guy that comes and fills in and I'm the last guy that will call up and Sher my duty and put it on to someone else and give them something extra to do and that is the image we need because those are the only people we take in the party the people that are that dedicated to helping and that is organically what people are already seeing uh forget the internet right that's what people see in their daily lives and is every person associated with the midwestern marks Institute in the ACP um in terms of like the faces of the in Institute uh yeah we have um uh myself I I I'm in the highest leadership body of the ACP as a secretary of education Noah is um what's the official title I'm I'm the Secretary of the Treasury or director of Treasury um Professor Danny Shaw who's a director of international department at The Institute he is in the poed bureau as an official Deputy to to Christopher halali who whom I was talking about just a second ago Eddie is um in the executive board as well so the top leadership of the party and Kyle who's the chief labor analyst of The Institute he's the director of personnel which is within the executive board as well he's the person that does the interviews goes around the country uh you know checking it on chapters and stuff like that uh also uh you may have seen Bridget's podcast that we do uh probably cancelled she's in the political Bureau as well so sort of uh you see me Edie Carlos Kyle were in the executive board and then others are in the political Bureau and I've seen a lot of these people on social media because I've been following this pretty closely not at the beginning but like this last week two weeks especially I've been seeing all these pictures coming in just like of the I was watching some of Eddie speech um that he gave I feel hell I feel like I know Eddie and Danny because I know that Danny follows the Forum very closely because um I just know that he follows on there because he's one of my public subscribers on that so I saw his name pop up Professor Danny Shaw shout out to Danny and um it's messed up I think they released him from John Jay didn't they yeah yeah he got fired for speaking out against the genocide yeah um he got interrogated he went for a whole month uh to 12 countries in Europe and Southeast Asia uh to do you know anti- genocide work and when he got back he got interrogated for 5 hours he had all of his electronic devices uh taken and and copied and he's kept on fighting so that's the the sort of spirit of individual that that we seek to have in the party especially in leadership yeah and something that we won't get into this is is the suppression is also a real thing and I think that the people who say that it's kind of Fain and exaggerated they say that because they're not affected by it I guess yeah I guess because you're kissing enough ass I guess you're not affected by it but the dissident voices are definitely being affected by this media suppression and I've actually and I'm not like I said this person between me and this person we have respect for each other but I was a little surprised that a guest reached out to me and was basically we were trying to do another interview together and they were like Kiko I just noticed like your views are becoming like more and more like low and I'm like you do realize that my channel has probably been shadowband like a lot of smaller Independent Media channels because I've done some that people I bring on and I can go from 2300 views on a video and I can bring the same person on and it's a thousand views less and then it's 500 views less I mean you can see it happen in real time like it happen we had we had gardland Nixon on like two months ago it got like almost 10K and then we had them on a month after that and it got two same individual same sort of uh uh promoting same similar uh uh thumbnail right and it's it's uh we're getting throttled all of us are getting throttled I mean it makes no sense our our YouTube we have 51,000 subscribers our average live stream uh can go anywhere from 1.5 to 2.5 three it's like that's a very very small percentage of the subscribers that we have what's the what's the point of subscribing if you don't see the videos of the people that you're subscribed to if only a very very small percentage is going to see the video like what uh and then there's other people whom I have never even seen uh before like the majority report I don't think I've ever seen a video from the majority report oh Sam Cedar oh my it gets recommended left and right to us or vow sure all these other people who we have never clicked on a video to watch but the algorithm just pumps us with it all the goddamn time no but something you said there about gosh what were you saying before majority report I was going to comment yeah the the the ratio of like views to subscribers yeah that's definitely a gameing play I know what it was the 2000 though honestly that's a significant number that's a signif that's like honestly that would be a badge of honor BEC and I say that because they must be seeing the threat to that like that 2000 number is really bigger than 2000 if you think about it because just imagine the other people who are sharing that content the the 2000 is really 5,000 you know who who's to tell like the real number it's I think that that scares them that they can't measure the impact that you're having even though you're just one champ but if you take a lot of Midwest of marks institutes you you start to accumulate after after a while you have a lot of power there look there's a reason that they've kicked Jackson off of every platform except for X they have yep every single one he's been banned from except for X so he doesn't have even dating sites he doesn't have to dive anymore oh he has it on Rumble so the new free speech uh platform yeah oh yeah rumble's very yeah yeah and by the way their coffee is really good just saying I I that the 1775 coffee yeah I think it was called Free Speech something weird advertisement yeah it's very weird it's got a little Rumble logo on it the other copy I really like is like a similar framing we like it's like the official ACP coffee now um it it's the Black Rifle Coffee Company it's like this coffee by veterans and it's the best coffee I've ever had in my life if you guys are watching um it's good like I drink coffee and we can do some work something out I'm just saying have you seen the the 1775 the rumble one it tries to feed into like masculinity but it does it too explicitly and the thing about mascul said you just do it you don't have to talk about doing it you just do it but it's like this is coffee for real men it's like are you hiding something what's going on there that's not guys I worked with um he's like one of those guys that like got really into watching Glenn Beck and all that kind of stuff re like really silly dude uh but I walk into the the the the cabinet we have different I walk into one of the shops at work right and he's just sitting there with another guy he goes yep couple of alpha males hanging out and I'm like I don't know if the actual alpha males have to announce it as I walk in the room Bud yeah you make a good point there but beautiful people I think this is the time we're almost two and a half hours in beautiful conversation I enjoyed every second of it I just do want to give youall a second to speak directly to my audience if they have a question or a comment directed to you whether it's you Carlos or anyone else within the Institute what would be the quickest way to get in touch with you all uh the email would be good Midwestern marks gmail.com for any questions I also want to uh shamelessly plug I'm going to be doing a class on Marxism leninism that starts November 7th and runs till the end of the year um it's part one of a two-part uh class on Marxism leninism part two is going to be from January to February uh in general we're going to be doing classes all the time and I'm I'm spearheading that effort alongside Noah who does the basics of Marxism class every once in a while um I uh recommend that people check out my recent book why we need American Marxism which can be found at Midwestern marks.com books I would like to think that I challenge the dominant narrative about what America is and what its relationship to socialist and and and radical struggles is um and I definitely recommend everyone pick up the recent issue of the Journal of American Socialist studies again Midwest marks prices you know so the scholarly level of the academy but on10th of Academy prices um that's the best way to support us either through classes or or or buying our books or becoming a patreon at patreon.com SL Midwest marks but those that are interested and and and think they have the discipline and time to participate in some of the organizing work that we're doing I definitely would recommend that they check out the ACP uh atp. us which is the official uh website you can find our party Constitution there as well as the party program which was just ratified at our first national Convention in Chicago this past uh October 12th um I'm going to reiterate you it if you're interested get a seat in Carlos's class sooner rather than later we're talking about one of the best teachers I've ever met in my life there's a reason he's the director of education for the party um and if you have like any questions at all every Monday at 6 PM Eastern we do my call-in show it's Noah's show uh I know I'm not very creative at naming things so there you go um and you can find me there every Monday um it's right down there at kiic on on X it's advertised all over so yeah hit us up um and that that's about it well I know for a fact that some of the people in my audience have definitely taken some of your coursework and they appreciate it I know I've purchased books before I think I've donated to um Noah's class just like you could send somewhere to donate and stuff I I always try to help when I can but um I just I'm really happy that we had this conversation today and that we will continue to have future conversations because we need Independent Media Independent Media is so important and I know people like to use that word a lot Independent Media but I truly believe that we're on the cuss with something great you guys do great work we're trying to do great work here and I think if we just been honest in our principles we can get somewhere I just um Don't Take debate with all this um be driven by something you know that that's going to take people with you and I like the price aspect the price points you can't be I like it that they're pretty uniform when you visit Midwestern marks Institute you go to their catalog and they're affordable you know and it hopefully it goes to them 100% does most of that go to you all uh for the books uh a decent chunk of it we we want to keep the prices as low as possible and the problem is that we use um a thirdparty printer and distributor so they take the lines a share of it but I think we get like two or three bucks for every uh book sale um and we have never wanted to go above that because it means raising prices uh so um but yeah it's uh it's we're trying to sell regular working people who who don't have uh you know 125 bucks to pay for a book which is what most academic Publishers when a book just comes out what they sell it for 120 130 um and you know a lot of the people that are publishing our books our academics they have the the degrees it's academic level work but priced uh at at the rate that regular working people can afford you gentleman again I can't
