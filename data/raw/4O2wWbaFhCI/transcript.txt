[Music] [Applause] [Music] House of dragons is the medieval Jerry Springer and I like that and I like that okay as somebody who watched both Game of Thrones and House of Dragons I'm going to come right out here with an unpopular opinion but I like House of dragons more and the reason I do is because the whole thing ain't nothing more than mideval Jerry Springer and that's my kind of carrying on like listen Game of Thrones can be very very tedious you got to keep up with a bunch of History a bunch of plot lines a bunch of backstory a bunch of War a bunch of all kind of tactical plans but for House of dragons all I need to know is who who who they not supposed to be and who got to get up as a result I loved House of dragons so much during season 1 that I actually started making video reviews for it after every episode on Twitter and people loved it but I didn't have a YouTube at the time so I said I definitely want to do season 2 on my YouTube channel the minute that it comes out so I figure the least I could do is give youall a whole big backstory a whole breakdown of season one for assada assada please y'all y'all haven't met assada actually officially it's crazy because she going to decide that this where she going to sit does this look like a place that a cat can just stay look at her y'all all know Raheem but recently I rescued this Kitty assada I literally rescued her okay I saved her literally off the road this is my baby I recently robbed her of her ovaries and that's why she has the con on assada can Mommy record you can't just stay here assada okay please all right all right anyway like I was saying before assada decided to interrupt me she's now laying down next to us I figure I really want to do recap videos of season 2 as it comes out so why not spin the block on season 1 and give yall a whole full breakdown first things first you do not need to have seen Game of Thrones to watch House of dragons and I know somewhere some dieh hard nerd just collapsed okay but listen listen Brenda you going to be all right house of dragons takes place like dumb long ago in the verse okay like a hundred or hundreds more than a hundred years before the events of Game of Thrones you'll be all right without that knowledge just know that house of dragons is about the targaryens okay you know the moutho of the Game of Throne Universe okay Daenerys targaryen's family it's about them all right and at the start of House of dragons listen okay I know this show is called House of the Dragon but I don't have time for that okay I'm black we call it House of dragons so at the start of House of dragons viseris is the king and y'all know how the whole royal monarchy bloodline thing is supposed to go he needs an heir he needs a son and at the start of House of dragons he don't got one but before we get there let's get to how we even ended up with viseris as king originally the Targaryen that was King didn't have a son so there became a whole question of who would be his Heir would it be his daughter rise or would it be his nephew viseris you know the universe hates [ __ ] the universe hates women I'm sorry clearly I hate women too ooh and so they went with viseris and not Reise making Reise known as the queen Who Never Was now in episode one's present day viseris does not have a son yet he has a daughter rera and at the beginning of the episode renea's mom Queen Emma is pregnant and viseris is gallivanting all around the kingdom telling people how he just know he going to have a son and because he knows he has a son coming he's preparing celebrations and that's where his focus is at but what we're eventually told is that renea's Mom has suffered like five different tragedies lost five different children just trying to have a son p viseris and she tells him listen I know my duty is to give you an air but this is the last time I've already buried five babies I'm not doing it again now back in the Kingdom we have a couple we got to focus on first is Damon Targaryen Damon is vas's brother and he is a sick and ain't nobody going to tell me different okay I know a lot of y'all stand Damon and y'all need to get help all right I remember when season one was Aaron and there was so many people romanticized in Damon and I was just over here like no amount of being on team black will have me siding with this wicked sociopathic Psychopathic nut ass and right out the gate you're supposed to know that Damon is problematic but you're supposed to receive it in this like badass that you're supposed to be rooting for like how they trying to present Damon funny enough it's kind of the exact same kind of energy they try to present around Damon in Vampire Diaries right who also came into the show being a sick Psychopathic mother but any Damon is a threat to vas's rule or at least that's how everybody but vasera sees it the main person who really sees it is the hand to the king Auto high tower who is another Wicked we need to focus on because viseris has no air there's always this commotion about whether or not he should name Damon his successor but sensible like utoh hi Tower wicked as he is but sensible he is as well sensible like utoh high tower are like no because he recognizes that Damon is a destructive violence psychopath who would be dangerous to the realm and needs to be kept as far away from the throne as possible but right quick you know what's real interesting about them deciding that Damon is a psychopath that needs to be kept away from the crown do you know where they decide to put him they decide to make him the chief of the city watch Like Chief of Police yeah yeah they decide that he should be kept away from the crown and they give him all the tools to wreak havoc on the poor towns folk right cuz surely that's the but on second thought is not the most Fitting Place for a dangerous violent psychopath the police force I mean makes sense so yeah we hate Damon because it's the police in every realm but yeah they sick nut ass Damon on the poor towns folk and he's round the place policing like he's Eric Adams I mean mutilated massacring the town folk talking about he rounding up the criminals but to be a little fair to Auto high tower at least when he heard that Damon was massacring the towns folk he was like um what like and he did try to tell viseris and them like y'all might want to get this wanting Gangsta away from seats of power and viseris is basically like what do you want me to do you told me to get him away from the court I had to give him a job what's up what's funny to me about this entire exchange is like while Otto and corus and everybody else at the table are trying to warn viseris about Damon he's like no no Damon's not a problem meanwhile Damon is listening to Shadows like you dumb [ __ ] you dumb bunny vasis literally goes Damon has ambition but not for the throne and this Damon that's what you think oh okay okay okay anyway so apart from that what we learn about Damon in episode one is that he has a wife that he don't be and they never be at the crib where he's supposed to be with her he be in the brothel and all the [ __ ] and he has crazy sexual tension with his 15-year-old niece rera anyway rera our protagonist is best friends with uto high Tower's daughter Allison another key character you need to learn about in the first episode reneer is depicted as being very close to her mother who she's already seen go through five incredibly difficult pregnancies but her mother reassures her that it's their duty to give their kings HS to give them a son and that soon she'll be doing the same too but rera not really with that Vision at all she's really not on that run she really is more into riding dragons and listening to what her daddy doing at the king's Roundtable she want to be a part of the decision making she won't be like the boys in the mix so Queen Emma goes into labor and instead of being at her bed side while she tries her Endeavor best to give birth to his beloved Heir viseris is out commencing like what do he call like the tournament of airs he out sh having games and festivities to celebrate the labor and what are the festivities he chose to have to celebrate having a son games when is riding horses trying to off each other and I mean literally like some did off each other the only thing you really need to know about these games is that we meet sir Kristen Cole who is a common born nobody who look good he do look good he do look good who's a common born nobody who actually whoops ass in these games including Damon's ass and rera takes note anyway while viseras is busy celebrating her labor Queen Emma is actually in labor and it's going terribly so the doctors call viseras and they're like hey um listen here right quick right quick right quick um you're ging this baby Gad so um you either we could try to save the baby like we could just call it a wraps on on both them now or we could try to save baby and let your let your wife bleed out to death what you want to do and then viseris decides all on his own CU it's important to note that they at no point bring this to Emma cuz God forbid a woman get to say on her own medical decisions right so viseris decides all on his own that his wife okay take the [ __ ] baby and let that [ __ ] bleed out and let me tell y'all it really was just as heartless as described it like it really was some cold [ __ ] literally the minute that viseris decides that it's the baby over Emma these doctors like they cease to stop seeing her as a person like they don't even see her they don't hear her she's screaming for help they grab her so violently and they literally tear this woman open while she's screaming and leave her to bleed out and die and what's extra crazy about it is up until this point the show has gone out of their way to let us know that viseras and Emma actually have like a real relationship that this is not just a political IAL marriage they actually love each other and there's some significance and closeness there they even go out of their way to show you that viseris is a Kinder man and King than most and even that Kinder man said his wife let her bleed out and die without any say for herself which should really tell you just how much these men value even the potential life of men and boys over the existing women and girls in their lives ain't that some [ __ ] so Queen Emma dies and then within hours the son she gave birth to dies too and with within hours everybody is just like who going to be V's Heir who he going to remarry so they can give him an heir we need a son we need a air Emma body not even cold yet like shoot it's not even cold hot right cuz they burn him up body ain't even charred up yet they done talking about the next [ __ ] he need to marry ain't that some [ __ ] and you know what this Auto high tower does uto calls down to his chamber his 15-year-old daughter and he says um hey right quick let me run something by you put on one of your mama's dresses yeah yeah put on one of your mama dresses and go down to that old Grizzly old man ass call the king otherwise known as your best friend's Daddy and um try to seduce him yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah that'd be nice you do that listen to me and listen to me good Auto high tower is a sick power hungry nasty like a nasty nasty and listen I know everybody hates Allison and me too too and me too and we going to get there but not this episode not for this not for this y'all be letting y'all hatred for Allison have y'all like victim blaming and blaming this little ass girl for the way grown ass men are taking advantage of her please please that little girl was quite literally a little girl being manipulated and pimped out by her daddy to her best friend's daddy while Otto is literally in the scene while otter was telling her to go down to the king's Chambers you can literally see this poor little girl stressed out tearing at her finger beds from the stress like listen poor baby okay that poor baby if you never feel for Allison ever again in your life feel for her now okay feel for her now this okay Allison deserved your sympathy at this particular moment the most important part of this episode is that viseris decides to name rera his daughter his Heir and listen even as somebody firmly team black this is single-handedly the worst decision this could have made but we'll get back to why later so episode 2 begins with Lord corus mad about Pirates and somebody called a crab feeder stealing his ships wrecking his ships all kind of problems right they doing pirate [ __ ] he's upset he really wants to go to war with the free territories and everybody is like um no dog no we like don't want to go to war but listen we really don't care for real I'm telling you House of dragons is really just about the Scandal okay we're here for the SC Scandal we're here for the mess but in the course of his ranting Lord corus mentions that Damon who's supposed to be at runstone is at Dragon Stone which he like illegally seized and has been there for a year and a half without any opposition from the crown so like in other words corus is basically saying I'm B here so then Otto says hey yo chill out my this the king you talking to a seat at the king's table does not make you his equal viseris responds to corus by letting him no listen we have it under control we have done things we have some soldiers waiting we have a protocol chill out right but ranero who's ease dropping says to viseris you have dragons you could send us on dragons it would be a show of force now I find this scene really interesting once you've seen the entirety of the show because when you first watch it it comes across like viseris lacks grit like he lacks the balls necessary to do what a king really does right which is clearly what people like corus and Damon believe right and it seems as though rera his daughter has that grit in the balls that he doesn't have but that she's being ignored because she's a girl at least the princess has a plan and rewatching the season I wonder if they truly intended for it to come across to us like that or if it just comes across to US based on the Stellar performance the actress playing young rera is giving with side note right quick in House of dragons rera is played by two actresses first her child self is played by Millie Alcock and then as an adult she's played by Emma Darcy and I don't know if this is an unpopular opinion but I don't really like the performance from the second actress who takes over as rera I don't know if it's that Millie just did that great of a job or if it's that by the time the second actress comes around I'm too accustomed to the performance given by the first actress or if it's the writing if they intentionally change the nature of the character in a significant way but to me it feels like when Emma takes over the role the character just kind of loses all the soul like everything that made you feel connected to the to the character basically all the girl boss energy okay everything that made her feel like a boss [ __ ] that made you want to root for her is gone she becomes this kind of timid scary character she just feels like she's lost all the essence of the first character or not not the first character the first rera right but that's really the problem is that they feel like two different characters young rera and old rera and the second rera old rera feels almost uninspiring they not only feel like two entirely different characters but one of them feels totally uninspiring at a time in the story when rera needs me to feel inspired they need me to Rally behind this character and the only thing that really keeps me on her team team black is because of the Goodwill earned by the original actress playing rera and I don't know if the show intentionally wanted us to feel as though the older rera had been gutted like she'd lost some of her spark to Motherhood or to the high Towers or that she just kind of been beaten down over time it's entirely possible like it's entirly possible that they wanted us to feel like she had lost she' lost something that she will that will be found by the time she learns of the events of the season finale and season 2 starts is entirely possible but I still feel very meth towards the second r R's performance anyway we'll talk about this later back to what I was saying about this scene what I was saying is that it's interesting that in the scene rera comes across us as though she's maybe stronger and wiser or has something that viseris lacks we're going to come back to this scene later on in the video when we're talking about the season finale because it's exactly this kind of thinking in this scene that I think is going to cost her dearly in the season finale and maybe reveal to us how viseris was a better king would maybe more long-term Vision than he was given credit for moving on so rise the queen Who Never Was and her husband Lord corus which by the way Lord corus okay these are the valarian they are the black people with blonde hair who also ride dragons but like they not the leader of the Dragons the way their targaryens are they are they got ships okay that's their whole thing but anyway the valerians are their cousins they're also real Royal they black they fine they pop in anyhow Reise and Lord corus try to offer up thear as their daughter their little daughter Lena for a hand in marriage right they're basically like if you marry her you could Unite our houses that would be real powerful that's a good move that's a power move rise and corus's entire argument is basically you looking real [ __ ] out here okay you out here naming girls to be your air your brother out here whing he done claim Dragon stone and you ain't said [ __ ] the pirat and the crab feeders out here whing on the stepstones you look like a [ __ ] right now you might want to get with the winning team and get some power show the realm that you not [ __ ] which tactically which tactically in their world is a sensible decision in my world is still some nasty nasty [ __ ] you are just selling your little ass girl to this old man and they is no day wrong you know I they is no day wrong you know what's crazy I'm sorry quick little at some point when rera when R is out here entertaining her different suitors right all these different men want to marry her she comments about all these old ass men wanting to marry her like o they should be ashamed to thems offering a old ass hand in marriage and it's like if you think that if you think that I feel like you need to have more to say about your daddy doing the same thing and you need to have more to say about cutting up with your uncle okay okay rera but anyway let's be real because viser doesn't even really consider their marriage proposal because utoh high tower has already got to him he's already been convinced that it's a good idea to maybe entertain his daughter's 15-year-old best friend okay and that shit's just so crazy for so many reasons for so many reasons because what really blows me is that viseris and rera already have a strained relationship and viseris allegedly cares about the fact that they have this strain relationship and yet he has the nerve to be in Chambers talking to his daughter's best friend who is 15 years old talking about oh she doesn't like to talk to you um she don't like to talk to you she don't like to talk to you your argument she don't like to talk to you she does not like to talk to you she feels distant from you since her mama died and you think that her friend is going to help bestie yeah yeah you think entertaining A diance with her little best friend is going to help okay all right cool mhm mhm mhm but more importantly he literally has nothing to gain from marrying Allison nothing like he can only gain problems it creates no new or strong alliances for him and it will create a mess in his personal and family life there's literally no reason to do this dumbness and what's worse but Sarah is already muddy the Water by declaring rera air he already has one problem under his belt so he declared his daughter air and now he wants to marry her little bestie like respectfully rest in peace to Queen Emma really miss my [ __ ] I really miss my [ __ ] why people you can sing it to just change that into a w miss my wigger but there's absolutely no logical reason why her death should have compelled viseris to name rera a or to feel like he wasn't going to have a son or get remarried again he and everyone else knew that he was going to remarry again quickly and have moreing kids because them's the rules which is something understood and explicitly stated by Rise when she's talking to rera rise goes as far as to inform rera that listen it does not matter that he named you air because when he dies the men of the realm will inevitably make whatever son we all know he's going to have King they're going to do that they're going to do that because that is the order of things his new wife will produce new hires and chances are better than not that one of those be male and when that boy comes of age and your father has pass the men of the realm will expect him to be air not you and the reason that rise knows what's up is because rise has quite literally lived it again the queen that never was but rera not trying to hear it rera actually starts trying to throw shade at ain't that some [ __ ] the ego son the ego she literally goes no no they didn't want you to be Queen but they bended the knee for me okay okay girl okay she's like it'll be different for me I'm not like the other girls it was really given Whitney Houston Deborah Cox same script different same script different cast like rera really thinks she's special all right the only the only legitimate reason that anyone would have had to believe that viseris was not going to remarry and have more kids Nam his son which would be if he died prematurely from the flesh eating disease that he clearly has which is a thing happening in the background at this point because at this point viseris and his doctors have not yet figured out the magnitude of the problem that is this cut that he has spreading all over his body that he got from sitting on the throne anyhow while all this is happening Damon who still has an attitude that rero was named air writes to the council and says Hey Hey listen I still haven't my actual wife or attended to any of of my real duties but I've impregnated my [ __ ] and not only have I stole one of y'all's dragon eggs to put in the crib of my bastard baby I stole the specific dragon egg that y'all had reserved for your baby boy that Queen Emma died given birth to how you like that [ __ ] to which the Round Table's response is basically we got to up yep yep that's it clearly we got to this up and viseris is like no no no that's my brother that's my brother and everybody is basically like are you stupid can't you see that this [ __ ] has gone crazy that he's uncontrollable don't you see him he sees Dragon Stone he's stealing dragon eggs he's surrounded by an army and Dragons wake up wake up wake up so Otto takes a trip to Dragon Stone to basically be like Hey listen right quick you got to leave Dragon Stone you got to return the egg and you got to banish this hor War Horus War but then Damon's Dragon Caris pops up like it's not going you know what I'm saying it ain't going nah nah it ain't going to work you sure about that are you sure about that rera rolls through on her Dragon Gets straight up in Damon's face and tells him hey reminder I'm the princess of dragon Stone and you're on my Throne doing clearly the problem you have is with me because I'm the heir so say it to my face if you're not going to kill me to my face then return this dragon egg and go about your business how about that unwilling to kill his niece you know I can't even be like unwilling to kill his niece because I'm not sure whe I don't I cannot hm do we believe that Damon's soft spot that he has for rera is because she's family or because he wants to go like that's a sick thing to have to ask right but like do we think the reason that Damon wouldn't lift a hand the reason do we think the reason that Damon doesn't hurt rera in this moment is because she's his niece because he doesn't want to really go to war or because he wants to his niece anyhow while we're pondering that Damon's [ __ ] not even pregnant he was wasn't even pregnant he was just capping for attention so Renea returns and visera tearfully tells her listen I have to get remarried I have to get remarried because of my duties to the realm and rera understands this and to give viseris a little bit of credit he did wait 6 months before he remarries or at least before he has this conversation with rera telling her that he's going to remarry and rera understands this she completely understands but here's thing understanding that your father the King has to remarry is an entirely different thing from understanding why he needs to remarry your 15-year-old best friend big difference my you definitely don't have to do that and he definitely didn't tell her and it's crazy because he's acting like he cares so much about his daughter's opinion that he has to like tearfully tell her oh I have to get remarried as though that's what her true objection would be like the real problem the thing he really needs to disclose to his daughter isn't that he's her best friend but he doesn't tell her that but immediately after he goes right to the round table where rera is in the room and so is Allison and then he announces to everybody that he's going to not just get remarried but Remar Allison high tower so Allison standing there looking anxious Renea is standing there looking stunned and corus is mad as like outrage this leaps to his feet and he's like this is absurd my house is literally the most powerful house in the realm like what is this disrespect what is this disrespect so corus and rera both storm out and the next we see corus he's back at his home in drift Mark where he summoned Damon to basically tell him listen my family has had to work for our [ __ ] okay we are technically if you according to some text we're actually older than the targaryens but we actually had to carb our names we didn't know dragons we couldn't just ride on the fame of dragons I actually had to go to seea and make a name for my family and I'll be damned I lose my my [ __ ] to some Pirates because your [ __ ] ass brother don't want to do [ __ ] about it so corus went from Damon as a liability doing the most to let me form an alliance with Damon because I'm sick of viserys's [ __ ] because viseris wouldn't consent to corus sending his Navy into the stepstones to battle the Pirates and the crab feeder so of course Damon and corus come up with a plan to go Rogue so episode three opens with Damon using his Dragon to burn up all of the the step Stones trying to trying to kill the crab feeder instead of killing the crab feeder he is killing all of the people that if he actually gave a about the people they would be theoretically trying to help right is wouldn't that be what it's about the the the crab feed and the Pirates have invaded this territory like poor people living there but no not at all they burning them up the only thing he actually care about all they care about is power anything that seems like a threat to that power these are just all these be is like just dick measuring contest he trying to burn up the crab VA but he can't because they keep uh the crab feeder keeps hiding in the caves right in the dragon can get in there so in this episode Alison is now fully married to the king calling viseris the king don't feel right you know Allison is fully married to viseris and fully pregnant with her second child and she's already had a son a gone and now she busy trying to get rera to with her but nothing to go so okay rera not with it and listen listen you know I already told y'all that I don't hold Allison responsible for having a viseris or having a get with viseris but [ __ ] act like you have some sense okay like imagine your best friend's mommy dies in childbirth and you sneak behind her back to [ __ ] her daddy then marry her daddy and now you w in around her mommy's Kingdom talking about how easy how your babies came without a fuss when her mommy died in child birth Allison need hering ass beat okay Allison need her ass beat like how she how did she possibly expect rera to with her like you know what I'm saying like even if you don't hold her even if you don't blame her for how she ended up with viseris that don't mean it make any goddamn sense that you would expect rero to with you like be be be so for real and speaking of abominable decisions that came about because of sick ass Auto high tower I really can't say it better than I said it the first time so roll it auto high tower really is the sick realm you know this man heard the king say man I don't want to just command rera to marry somebody man I wanted to be happy and OT say oh happy happy um you know what I think would make that [ __ ] really happy what if she married her 2-year-old brother and in MO sickness the King was like he's only two he's also her brother babe wa why you Al B listen uh-uh I just I understand incest was a thing back in the day but I just don't understand how because I shouldn't have to tell you your brother is nasty you supposed to feel it in your spirit Society shouldn't have to tell you that one you supposed to feel that betrothing your children supposed to be nasty no matter what the age difference is nasty that's how OD Auto W power he would have this gal marry his 2-year-old grandson anything to get to the throne anything you know sick anyway this episode basically revolves around visera trying to muscle rera into getting married the Romantic buildup between rera and Sir Christen Cole and Damon getting his ass handed to him in the stepstones because he fighting this unauthorized war is now making the realm look bad basically what happens is rera and viseris argue because she keeps swerving her many marriage proposals viseris is on his hunt for like this magical Beast I think it's a stag it might just be a regular I don't know J a beast viseris is on his hunt for it but he doesn't find it but rera does and she goes rolls back into camp like a boss viseris finally agrees to send Damon help in this unauthorized war that he's been fighting and losing and then Damon gets so angry at the concept of needing help from viseris that he he just his rage just empowers him to be able to get in a little boat and and and suddenly win the war by his Lonesome that he wasn't able to win all this time okay and we do meet Lara strong this episode and I just want to point that out cuz he is a you got to keep your eyes on okay episode four starts with Damon having won the little war he comes back with a little haircut and a makes crown and now all of a sudden he bending the knee and acting like he have respect and child whatever at this point sir Christen Cole is renea's right-hand man she's rejected all of her marriage proposals and Allison cannot find any sympathy for her situation Allison basically says oh wo is you how much it must suck to have every eligible young bachelor in the Seven Realms Seven Realms no Seven Kingdoms one realm why that's sound like a mixtape but basically you have your pick of Bachelors when when every other girl in The Realm would be lucky if she even had to right cuz I want to remind y'all Allison was forced to marry Beetlejuice but rera is basically like think dummy they're not fawning over me they're fawning over my title my valarian blood for their offsprings being dragons Allison like the one track doal bird she is goes she thinks it's romantic and it's crazy right because like how what was romantic about that like what was romant like what did she hear is romantic she heard a bunch of men a trying to marry me so that they could extract my resources and Allison heard but at least them don't look like Beetlejuice it sounds great to me but reneer basically shoots back oh yeah how romantic it must be to be imprisoned in a castle and forced to squeeze out airs and immediately the grief is all across Allison's face which rera picks up on and goes I'm sorry so in that moment Renea Cana realizes that Allison is literally living out what r era considers one of the worst Fates and so she has some sympathy for her in that moment and they basically tell each other that they've missed each other right and it seems like okay they they getting back on the right foot a no and now here's the quiet part that's never said super out loud at this point but it's shoved in your face and it's that rera and her Uncle Damon are very into each other but rera and Sir Christen Cole are also into each other so rera and Damon have a conversation about how she's matured over over the she's matured over the last four years brother nasty you know nasty she complains about the pressure to get married he tells her it's all political you could get married and do whatever you want and she says that's not the case for women that's only like that for men and he's like yeah like we could do whatever we want if that was the case I wouldn't be married to my bronze [ __ ] right because every opportunity Damon gets he going to sland to his wife like every chance he get that is going to slander that innocent woman we haven't seen or heard none from just drag her name to the mud child so after this Damon leaves a map he leaves this map that Renea finds so that she could basically go follow him in the shadows to the broths where he could get all haunted up with his niece my disappointment is immeasurable and my day is ruined but the gag is he take her to the broths like he's Mr Big Man meanwhile meanwhile she was very much trying to and he was not now let me tell you what really annoyed me bad about this moment he goes to the trouble like they addressed stuff all in in Cognito so they could move through the red keep so that I think it's the red keep right yeah so they could move through the red keep so they could get to the broos right only to get in the brothel the place think think about this they they hid themselves in cognito just to walk through the red key which isn't even technically the elicit activity right only to get in the brothel and immediately disrobe and show everybody their silver taryan hair while they get haunted up in the brothel like where is the sense where is the sense in that anyway Damon wasn't trying to but he done get rero all haed up so rera say I ain't about to have blue ball she goes back to the kingdom and immediately starts trying to put some [ __ ] on S Christen gold okay and put some [ __ ] on him she did now I want y'all to know all right before before I switch up I just want y'all to know when I first watched this when this when this episode first air I was like like yes like at this point listen sir Christen Cole is mad cute and at this point the man had been a gem he hadn't done nothing wrong and he was the obvious choice as far as I'm concerned of course we're going to root for him over the evil thumb Uncle like be so for real right so at this point I'm like so my girl rera finally get to get her dick wet and she would have got away with it too if it wasn't for that medling uto high tower so apparently Otto got all kind of spies all around a red keep like he's Pablo esar right one of these little spies F fera and Damon and the Brath getting hot and heavy right so they so they just assumed they so they going to go tell OT that and let me tell you something Otto couldn't run fast enough to viser chamers okay that he I mean he couldn't wait to snitch he was in the chambers like listen hey hey hey hey I know it's the dead night but um your daughter is a hoe disinherit her disinherit that hoe [ __ ] okay she was out here he couldn't wait he could not wait child because you know his number one agenda is to see his grandson made King is to see his grandson become the heir right so he tells viseris this and viseris is like I know you did not come in here calling my one good daughter a hoe I know you didn't I know you didn't oh so then Alison hears that rero was Damon in the brothel and she gets so angry because I don't know why I like this is the moment where the blood of the first Dead hater just seems to coarse through this bitch's veins for the rest of the show child from this moment forward she about to spend the rest of her life angrily clocking renea's [ __ ] miles okay she want to know where it's been and who has been there with okay this girl actually fixes her mouth to send for rera to question her about whether or not she Damon and dog I mean like questioning her for True like questioning her for true you know like Angry in her face turned up like rolling up on her in the garden and to this day and to this day I still cannot understand what made this nut [ __ ] feel like was her place to be demanding question I I really I I really can't understand it like imagine a [ __ ] your daddy your daddy your daddy before your mommy corpse even called and thinking she get to question you about who you I know you lying like let me tell you something let me tell you something I thought white man had audacity but nobody has audacity like Allison high tower okay that the audacity on that [ __ ] is crazy like Allison is really standing there being a [ __ ] that the entire realm knows regularly Beetle Juice turning up her nose at Renea like dog she's unreal disrespect time rera is like you know it's a vile accusation to accuse me of sleeping with and Allison goes is it you you targaryens are known to have queer [Music] Customs you targarian are known to have queer Customs word [ __ ] this you this you this you who is lay next to a old K and Taran every night we have queer Customs but it's you who daddy told you to put on your dead mother's dress to go seduce my daddy but it's us who we let me tell y'all something if I was rero I would actually still be dislodging my foot out of Alison ass for asking me that ain't no y who daddy work for us and who my daddy going to be standing and my garden questioning me about where my [ __ ] been and who had been there with no sir no sir no one knowing she my senior citizen dying Daddy no sir not me anyway though rera just denies it instead of asking Allison what the it mean y'all can't see it but assada just bit me like and she's still there like you see her mouth is still aada do people can see you biting me why are you biting me what's the problem assada assada okay I'm going to pick you up I promise you I'm going to give you some love just let go my shirt what's the problem aada likes attention I guess she just wanted attention yeah she's purring now it's my apologies I had you up my fault my fault okay I have to record is that okay oh my God he immediately put a paw on me the minute I said can I record when aada decides she wants love it's it's love time anyway rera denies it instead of asking Allison what the it has to do with her and Allison believes her so V's questions Damon and rather than deny it Damon being the nasty he is is like why does it matter if I her he's like why does it matter if I your daughter me and you was all the GS in the broths back when we was her age viseris ever the believer in gender rules is like it's different we were men she's just a young girl she's just a young girl and she's your niece and and again resident nasty Damon is like better me than these other and so viseris is like you've ruined her ain't nobody going to marry her now and Damon is like let me marry her let me make an honest woman out of her and viseris is like bang I [ __ ] I I get it now I see the play you don't even want to marry her this is just because she's the heir you want to throne he was like you already have a wife take your ass back to the veil where your wife is and go consumate your marriage and go fulfill your duties viseris is all heated at Damon rera and in a surprise twist Allison just having been convinced by rera that it didn't happen takes up for rera she tells viseris that Damon is an opportunist and a liar and that he just wants you to believe he rera which is true this is all true so viseris believes Allison which she should in this context she's right she is right but because he believes Allison he decides to fire her daddy Otto cuz in his mind it's Otto who gave him that bad Intel because he's working against his daughter which is also all true so he fires Auto dun dunun so episode five begins with Damon seemingly following instructions and returning to the veil to his wife but he returns to the veil to murder his wife and it's stuff like this that I don't know how people get past in order to Dick ride Damon like this is a wicked son he's a wicked guy so we finally meet his wife that he been slandering all throughout the realm and she's a cool [ __ ] actually she is a cool [ __ ] who was unimpressed by this psychopath thumb she has to call a husband and he took that person and they don't show it but Damon beats her to death with a rock so next we see Otto he is high tailing his ass out the kingdom peris's request but not before Allison runs him down crying like Oh Daddy don't go and Otto was not moved okay child he was like I don't know what you crying for when it's yes they got me fired cuz you want to be all in theer air talking about Bel rera and she was like no man Daddy no man daddy your informants were wrong man your informants were wrong I promise you she wasn't am I telling you man and OT was like listen to he you dumb funny that girl is lying she's a liar and Allison countered out with no no no this is all your fault you two like schem to try to make aegon so Otto gets Papa Pope serious with a child and he's like listen here he's like that old Beetlejuice upstairs that y'all call King he ain't going to live long okay he could die soon and when he do the realm is not going to let the air be a [ __ ] okay if rera becomes Queen it'll be War before they let that [ __ ] be under Throne okay we need to make aegon air for the safety of the realm it'll be War now in the next scene remember I told y'all about Lis [ __ ] ass strong larris plants the seed that is going to begin Allison's entire villain Arc and quick a little side note about larison the disabled villain Trope because I remember one time seeing commentary on how villains in media often depicted as disabled if you think of like scar The Joker Captain Hook Freddy Krueger right like all these different people and so Lis kind of plays into that Trope so anyway Laris ever the opportunity is looking to ingratiate himself with a powerful Queen takes his ass over to Allison in the garden and he's like oh what an injustice how your daddy was fired because you ain't heard it for me but rero was definitely and she definitely lied to you and listen baby when I tell you Alison run hot she run so hot and she never cooled down ever ever again for the rest of time okay beef all right like Allison is the epitome of his up and his stuck the epitome so while this is happening viseris and corus are having a conversation they come to an agreement that rera is going to marry Lord corus's son sir ler the brother to Lena their daughter they had once tried to marry off to viseris they come to a compromise that Lor and R's children will be valarian but if any of them Ascend to the throne then they'll be targaryens because as verer puts it targaryens have run [ __ ] all this time and they going to keep running [ __ ] so rera and loo are cousins so they already know each other so they now meet with the knowledge that they have to get married and they immediately come to an understanding and that understanding is that Ser Lenor is gay and Renea wants to be for the streets so they agree to marry and produce heirs but be free to do whatever and whomever on the side which is Magic to both their heirs now everybody with good sense knows Lor is gay including his father Lord corus but he doesn't want to acknowledge it cuz power cuz power he dancing all around drift Mark like ooh what a great Arrangement what a great deal I corupted like oh and Rise is over there like you know our son is gay why are you putting him In Harm's Way you setting him up for failure you are literally endangering his life and then Corless ass over there being Lulu and deliberately obtuse and he's like what maybe he Lo Gro G so rise once again tries to plead with this man and she's like listen to me and listen to me good they will never let rera be Queen they will kill her her husband and her ears so it is our son whose life you are endangering with this and corus is like but we've got dragons and we've got chips what could ever go wrong now now here is the moment where this episode becomes known as the episode that sir Christen Cole becomes the most [ __ ] ass in the realm I mean [ __ ] assness of Epic Proportion Olympic level [ __ ] I never seen nothing like it to this day to this to this day never seen nothing like it so rera is on the boat on the way to her marriage with sir Lor when sir Christen Cole approaches her apparently having just fell out the [ __ ] and into the Lulu land and he says let's run away together let's start over let's be nobody so we could be married and be in love and while he's saying that my girl Renea is looking at him like like she can't even believe her ears at one point while he's giving her the speech my girl is like are you asking for leave you asking to quit she was like if you want to you want to go do your own thing a no that ain't no problem that ain't no problem but she's really looking at him like have you lost your mind you want me to give up the Seven Kingdoms to be your wife to be nobody with you be serious dog like play a position play a position like just look at R's face look at her hands look at her hands and that's when she tries to hit him with the bad news good news like no um no I'm not going to give up being heir to a kingdom but good news we can keep she's like me and my betrodd made an arrangement we are free to do as we please he going to do his thing I'm going to do my thing which is you you're my thing and then and never before seeing L sir Kristen Cole is like you want me to be your wh that was like [ __ ] do I look like your [ __ ] am I just a mother concubine like this on the boat and he really starts tripping like out loud tripping mind knew this supposed to be a secret affair you know he starts tripping this outraged like dog just look at his face look at his face but in all seriousness let me break down just how irritating this is like moments ago no was just trying to give up his Knighthood so he could go Liv in infamy with her but the minute she knock with the vision suddenly being a KN is the most important [ __ ] that ever happened to him it's the only thing he has and she sullied it be so for real mind you he wouldn't even be a night if it wasn't for rera so what are we even talking about also this whole I took an oath chassid nonsense first of all sir Christen Cole was no virgin in episode 3 he was talking to Rene and talking about when he used to be knocking [ __ ] down once upon a time ago second and importantly sir Chris Cole is grown he is renea's senior and he is very much her senior the entirety of the show but more importantly he is very much her senior when he takes her virginity which she did not take at gunpoint which she did not take after promising to be with him or to marry him or to anything she didn't try to have sex with him and then he suddenly started telling her about his chassity and his oath no no no no no she didn't do nothing at fun point he was all too eager to Dick her down he in fact he quite literally unarmed himself he had to take off a metal a metal suit a metal suit and at no point did she promise to marry him or be with him for eternity or do [ __ ] that man never once brought up his chassity or any moral afflictions or any of that [ __ ] but the minute she rejects his romantic proposal all of a sudden he hyperventilating about his chassity get the [ __ ] out of here with that also let me remind y'all that rera is played by two actresses because one has to denote her in childhood and one has to denote her in adulthood so Christen Cole is played by one actor he is a grown ass man the entirety of the show and he the entirety of his sexual relationship consists with rera in her child era in her youth era like just look at how this grown ass man is carrying on in front of this little girl like somebody get him the out of here so he storms off to go pout at the other end of the boat presumably but while this is happening Lor is off talking in his boo who's considerably happier than sir Kristen Cole was to learn that he'll be able to continue his relationship with his beloved now this is the moment like the last scene was just like it shocked me when I watched it the first time I was just shocked I never seen a man conduct himself in this model but it didn't make me hate him it wouldn't make me Stu with him but it wouldn't have make me hate him but this next scene is when I let me explain something to you despise this is I start despising sir Kristen Cole oh my God so back at the palace Allison is still busy trying to get a [ __ ] report on rero because lus has convinced her that she's demon so Allison calls sir Christen Cole to her Chambers hoping to question him but this folds folded like a [ __ ] like she didn't even have to it wasn't even about him she wasn't on to them or nothing she thinking about Damon this man it was me so from this moment I despise her Kristen Cole and Allison despises renero okay it's up in a stuck from that moment forward in her mind Renea done lied straight to her face and got her daddy fired and now she she's alone in this Kingdom married to an old dying man raising a bunch of babies meanwhile she resents rera because in her mind rera gets the all the cutest in the kingdom and do what she wants and skirts her responsibilities right like rera got way too much freedom for Allison's liking cuz Allison feels imprisoned by Duty child so anyhow she is hot so she gets to do all this and still get to be air over Allison's child Allison is hot okay this she cannot live with but to shoot rera some bail hair not the you know what to shoot rera all the bail cuz like I said this is this shouldn't be Allison's business but more importantly rera didn't lie Allison asked her whether or not she came in she didn't AO said she Damon and she didn't his intel was wrong Allison asked her a very specific question about Damon if she wanted a broader answer she should have asked a broader question so The Royal Wedding celebrations begin because again rera and Lor are getting married and the whole time this dinner is going on Sir Kristen Cole is heated heated I mean wor side chick in history like cannot play his position for nothing like blowing up the spot like he over there like Arthur fist Arthur fist like it don't even make no sense like it doesn't make any sense this literally has known the entire time he has known rera and been R's right hand it has been to Renea according them having Renea prepared to get married Renea picking a [ __ ] to get married like it makes no sense it makes no sense he been R have been knowing like none of this I mean my God this man is so heated she's getting mad married and for the love of God I cannot understand why he literally knew that he and her could never be a thing he knew she was the heir to the Seven Kingdoms and he knows that she's not even into her husband so what's all this himing and hor on about then in the middle of dinner Allison shows up dramatically and intentionally late in the middle of aeris's speech and she shows up in green which is the moment like team black and Team Green become a real thing right like that that's her in high tower land green means they going to war so that was the way she let everybody know it's up and and stuck and it's though we don't have enough drama going on of course Damon shows up because unbeknownst to Sir Kristen Cole he and rera aren't endgame Damon and her are meanwhile Lor's Buu who reasonably understands that this Arrangement is a good thing for him and whoever R's lover is and that the marriage in no way threatens what they've got going on he's observant enough to be able to tell that sir Kristen Cole must be Rene's side chick because again I told you he in the corner with the Arthur fist going ballistic so Lor's Buu decides to go initiate a conversation with sir Kristen Cole to tell him that they're allies and let me tell you something in a sensible world you would think that a jealous man like sir Kristen Cole would be ecstatic to learn that sir Lor is gay and to maybe have somebody who understands his situation but child sir Christen Cole took that [ __ ] personally I guess in his mind the only thing worse than being her [ __ ] is being her [ __ ] in a club with another [ __ ] he was so mad and in fact my personal theory is that he was so mad seeing Damon and Renea making eyes at each other but he know he can't actually go show out or act out on Damon and so he really marches through the party and beats Lor's boo to death I mean the [ __ ] was brutal the scene was like that I was truly like upset like when I say Sir chrisen Cole is irredeemable to me like he is a [ __ ] ass forever more I dog it was gruesome and poor Lor dog he was hurt the way Lor ran with B the way they show it that his head my do and then as though he's not already the weakest most [ __ ] in the realm he go go to the Garden to go kill himself and then Allison saves him and thus beginning a lifetime Allegiance between these two jealous [ __ ] losers who can't live with their own choices so they blame rera oh oh and then rera and Lor have a very very miserable gloomy bloody wedding immediately after the dinner because celebrations are done festivities are done once you murder the scene like nobody want to party with y'all so might as well get it over with so episode 6 jumps 10 years into the future and Allison and rera are now being played by different actresses to denote that they're adults now so the episode begins with rera giving birth to a baby boy but absolutely nobody sces because everybody knows even though they can't say that they know that the children are not Lor you know why they know that the children aren't Lor because they're white because they're white Lenor is a black man with blonde hair and the babies are white brunette so everybody knows well everybody except viseris okay who at this point is fully matured into the living dead and loves his daughter way too much to notice that her babies are melanin deficient bastards Okay now what's crazy though is literally seconds after Rara gives birth Allison has the gall to demand that the baby be brought to her that [ __ ] was really crazy I would have had to beat Allison's ass like Allison is so overdue for ass whooping at this point it's crazy but instead rera still bloodied decides to take her baby and drw drag herself literally up the stairs across the palace to take this baby to Allison and what's really funny about this is Allison literally only wants to take a gander at the baby just a gander just a just a peep cuz a gander is all she needs to see whether or not the baby's black it truly I must say rera is my [ __ ] but it truly warms my heart that in this mythical Universe a white woman is being shamed because her babies aren't black beautiful like we we love to see it we love to see it oh look at Fantasy we soon meet R's two other children both boys both white but more than that I think more than being white I think I want to remind you both rira and Lor had the signature silver white blonde hairs there targaryens and valarian meanwhile all Renea babies is Big Time brunettes and that's because they look just like their father sir Harwin strong who is literally present at the chambers when Lor and rera get back with the newborn then we meet Allison and visera versus demon children and basically Dragon practice now let me say this right out the gate they kind of try to trick you into feeling bad for aan because he doesn't have his own dragon because I guess there weren't enough eggs and Aon jeras and lueras are all kind of teasing him about not having a dragon and they trick him into believing he has one and then they show him a pig but listen all ad and him a is every bit of the Slytherin looking ass Death Eater that he is okay and I wouldn't even mislead y'all into wasting a second of your life thinking that there's anything we're feeling sorry for him about him just hate him off rip while this is happening Allison is in Chambers begging viseras to accept that renea's children are bastards and that they're not Lor and that he should be angry about it and viseris is basically like keep my daughter's name out your mouth before you meet some grave consequences [ __ ] so Allison realizing that she doesn't have an air and viseris goes off to complain to the one person who wants to hair it most sir Christen Cole's [ __ ] ass and here's what's funny while Allison is working overtime worrying about renea's children her children are busy being degenerates because literally in the next scene we see Aon jacking off in the same window Joffrey's brother going to kill himself in in like a 100 years and as you see aegon jacking off in the window you think to yourself This is who Allison so badly wants to be air the audacity on that [ __ ] is crazy this who we need to entrust the realm to okay okay okay I see you're unserious you're un serious I got it and the gag is aegon is unserious and he knows it he has no interest in being King but Allison is literally working over time to convince him that rero will kill him and his brothers and anybody when she becomes Queen because they're a threat to her Reign and aegon is just like well then I won't challenge her and Allison is like listen to you dumb buunny they they going to kill you regardless [ __ ] listen open your ears and then we see Damon who is now married to Lena valaran and they already have two children and two daughters and now Elena is pregnant with their third child and it's very clear that the show wants us to see that Damon has matured in some way that he loves on some level the relationship is real that he's made a family here for real they want you to feel like he's a better man on some level but listen all that okay all that you can't fck all that you can't murder your last wife and now think I'm going to give you brownie points for this one the man merked his last wife and y'all reward him with a black queen no sir no sir I don't like it I don't like it I don't like it I always hated it but speaking of evil look at Allison's demon children with renea's children fueled by the hate of Sir Christen gold all because he's mad that they're sir harn's kids because sir Harwin gets the rera and it's like you could have [ __ ] you could have got to [ __ ] rera you had first dibs okay she literally you were supposed to be side chick number one you was her main [ __ ] like whose fault is it that you didn't want to play a position that you didn't want to be the bottom [ __ ] this is your own fault there was enough [ __ ] to go around that's all I'm saying rera told you anyway Kristen Cole is so petty I'm surprised he don't walk around the kingdom singing I Hit It First like he's so crazy so then they fired toar and strong from the city watch for defending jeris and lucer because let's be real what it really is is you looking like they father too loudly in public that's what that's what the real thing he's getting fired for that's the quiet part they won't say out loud right so then the hand who is now s Haren Strong's Daddy I think Lionel strong he goes to go resign he goes to resign he's like listen my son is disgraced at house I can no longer like walk around his house with what people be saying and viseris is like what they be saying viseris is like challenging like yeah yeah say it say it if use mind say mention to me the bastard allegations and because he ain't going to say it he ain't going to say it like mind you hold on wace is happening Allison is right there like yeah say it say it uhhuh cuz she want she went hair it so bad Hayden [ __ ] but he doesn't say it and viser is like okay so you can't resign but then he ask okay well can I at least accompany my son back to our home if he's not going to be in the city watch he needs to now resume his role of leadership of heading our house right now remember I told y'all earlier that adult rera is way more than youth rera rera now feels incredibly vulnerable that people are always talking about her sons being bastards and she's worried about Allison's family so instead of acting like a [ __ ] who is the heir to the kingdom and has her own dragons she tries to make herself small and she tries to appease Alison so she tries to publicly apologize to Allison for any issues there may be between them and she offers for her son jeris to marry Allison's daughter Helena her sister who I guess Helena is and she promises that when Cyrax gets their next batch of eggs Cyrax is her Dragon when Cyrax gets some more eggs they make sure that Allison's son aan gets dibs done getting an egg viseris of course loves this Allison not moved okay but what is crazy is while Allison is busy casting all this judgment on reneo cuz she Arwin strong meanwhile she got Laris strong think about this she hate you know what I you know what actually do make more sense I was going to say she casting all this judgment and I was going to say that's crazy but when you think about it if rera is [ __ ] har and strong let's let's take a second and look at sarin strong cuz he do look strong rera get S Harin strong and you get Laris before I even go on my next tangent that makes sense it makes sense that you would be hating it makes sense to be a hater but what's so funny is he acting oh I'm so Duty and all my sacrifices and like Allison don't even try to get a wild thing like like it's not like it's not inappropriate for you to get your feet you would not be allowed to have lus rubbing your feet they you would be [ __ ] on in the kingdom and talk they'd get you out of like amolin girl so to me if you going to do reckless [ __ ] why not go do something sensible it actually makes no sense to me why so Kristen Cole and Allison aren't [ __ ] like what is he getting out of this like how are you literally just hate just haterade fuels you that's it purely being a hater he don't even get nothing Laris like if I was ever Lis that's how know s chrisen Cole dick whack that's not right way let's move on Lis is helping her plot against his own brother and father his own brother and father wickedness now back Yonder wherever Damon and Elena are Elena is in labor and it's not going well and again I told you they want to make it a point to show us that Damon is much Kinder and a better man now it's funny because this whole Damon Lena setup is the epitome of like and how I met your mother if you watch How I Met Your Mother how they waste all your time showing you Ted be amazing with his wife who actually ends up being the mother just so they could immediately put him with Robin and it's like that woman was wasted and it's the same thing it's like they just want to show you the only reason they're bothering to show you like a good relationship with Damon and Lena or try to try to show you he's a man is because they want to make it easier for you to feel comfortable rooting for him and and reneo window together cuz is evil so child whatever what so anyway like I said they're trying to makeing a point to show you that Damon is a better man now so remember how in episode one when Queen Emma was in labor and they and the doctors came to feris to ask him to make a choice and he made the choice without even letting Emma play any role in it well now the doctors come to him and let him know like Hey listen Lena probably not going to make it you could choose to try and save the baby he doesn't make the call he lets Lena know now I am about to have what's called an unpopular opinion when Lena learns that she is likely to die during child birth Lena decides to go outside and bag her Dragon to barbecue her and even the dragon didn't want to do that [ __ ] she was literally crying drais before that Dragon reluctantly ended her mama now I remember watching this in real time and then getting on Twitter and everybody being like yes yes girl bosss yes we love it and I'm like okay maybe yall don't care about the fact that she decided to light her and the baby up without even the slightest consideration of whether the baby might have made it but she decided to have herself barbecued outside of her existing children's bedroom windows godam and they left her charred body out there like they left it out there like um could you just imagine how traumatic that [ __ ] was for her babies they went to sleep thinking that they were going to have a new sibling and they woke up to their mother and new siblings babies bodies charred outside their window think about the children think about the like I get it I get it I get it go out on your own terms but I mean okay though okay now remember I told y'all that Harwin strong and his daddy were leaving to go back home would y'all believe me if I told you Laris got them burned to death he literally had his own brother and father burned alive for no other reason than to ingratiate himself with Allison and to become I guess to become the head of the house sick I was upset and I really liked Harwin and I really liked his daddy I was upset sick episode seven begins with Lord corus's Brother throwing mad shade at reneer and her children at Lena's funeral madade he all in the funeral like Lena leaves behind two real children not bastards Lena kids got real valaran blood staring right at rera he wanted to call rera a filthy mud blood so bad and viseris rera and Damon all picked up on the shade it was clear and poor jeris has way more sense than his mommy gives him credit for he knows that Harin strong is his daddy and that he just died so when rera goes over to jeras to tell him to go Comfort lay his daughters because they just lost their mother he looks rera dead in the eye and he tells her he has an equal claim to sympathy and they should be at Harwin Strong's funeral I know that's right I know that's right baby I know that's right stand for your daddy okay rep your daddy rep your set we love it but rera just continues to Gaslight her son for his own safety and insists that they are not family H okay girl okay and shortly after that we learned that the same Allison who was outraged at the idea of marrying her only daughter to jeris instead married her only daughter to her sick ass degenerate ass son or intends to marry them rather and then the second son aan is sitting there looking at Helena like I wish I was the one who could Marry Her Like thck freak and anyway despite the fact that corus's brother was throwing mad shade at renea's kids corus is not doing them like that because corus eyes have always been on the sh that man wants the valaran on the throne which rise finally calls him on she says to him that you act like you're doing all these things to get Justice for me because I was robbed but this is really about your own ambition for power and she says it's your own ambition that's costing us our kids because Lena's dead now she then insists that they should pass drift mark down to Lena's kids because Lena's kids are real valyrians not reras but corus says that he's not trying to cast an even darker Shadow on renea's Sons and as he puts it to her plainly history doesn't remember blood it remembers name and even though Lena's kids might have his blood Rene's kids have his name and that name is good enough for him and not for nothing his motivations are not entirely pure altruistic or even mostly pure altruistic but at least corus is showing some kind of kindness to Reno's kids he treats those boys like their family in a kingdom where everybody doing them like they John snow you know but Reise was sick about that sick about it now here's the fundamental difference between Rino's sons and Allison's Sons jerus went to comfort Lena's daughters even though he's lost his own father and no one will or can comfort him but aan goes out of his way to steal Elena's dragon that her own daughter was supposed to get so when Lena's daughters discovered that aan stole their mother's dragons they are incredibly upset and this wicked Little Death eer starts talking crazy to them and he literally starts punching and beating up these girls with all his might so renea's son's jumping and everybody starts jumping him but eventually aan gets to drop on them he gets to drop on lueras renea's youngest son and he gets a rock to bash him he literally says that he's going to kill him like he literally tells him that he's going to die he has The Rock to him and he tells him he's going to die screaming like his father and he calls them bastards and brings up Harin directly like outright so jeras pulls out a blade and eventually lueras gets it and did exactly what needed to be done lights out [ __ ] so now big family conference big family conference and everybody there except Lor viseris Allison Damon corus rera and all the kids and of course Allison there playing big defense for her Wicked ass son she claiming he was the victim and renea's kids attacked him meanwhile Lena's kids and Allison's kids are there telling the real story mind you you know so jeris tells rera that they called them bastards right so rera tells viseris no my sons were defending themselves against vile ass accusations and she says what the accusations are so viseris is like where did you hear that from and aan knowing that if he says it was his mom Heads Will Roll he says Aon told me so viseris asks Aon where'd you hear at and aegon is like we know I didn't hear it from nobody we know everybody knows just look at them and poor viseris poor viseris at this point viseris don't even got no arm no more viseras is missing her arm and these people stressing him right the [ __ ] out with all this family drama okay so viseris is like oh this incessant family fighting [ __ ] has to stop it yall are family cut it out and Allison is like that's not good enough I want one I want one of her son's eyes I want an eye for an eye like this [ __ ] has officially lost a mind this is really the moment when rera should have realized that this is a nut [ __ ] who's lost all her Marbles and she really need to hem this [ __ ] up like the moment a [ __ ] asks for your son's eye you need to hem her up that [ __ ] is a problem that [ __ ] hates you like that's hate that's hate ain't no family in that so vas tells her hell no and she straight up says [ __ ] you [ __ ] what the king said and she demands that sir Christen Cole takes one of Lucas's eyes this is really the moment for me when Renea really solidifies becomes a [ __ ] like this is this is it because From This Moment forward renea's soulle Focus was supposed to be how did she eliminate Alison and her entire family from that moment from that moment forward she wasn't even supposed to be able to sleep comfortably without without knowing that Allison is [ __ ] 6 feet under like even sir dick rider Kristen Cole knows that Allison has gone too far cuz he tells her no and viseris tells her like stop your [ __ ] and if anybody else questions the lineage of renea's sons I'm going to have your tongue removed so then Allison straight up grabs the knife off of sarus and then charges at rero with this knife and she doing the most exposing her deep-seated hatred for rero meanwhile her Wicked son aan don't even give a [ __ ] because all he care about is getting a dragon let me tell yall something rera should have lit the entire high tower line up for this and her not doing so was the first Act of weakness that would cost her bitterly son but to shoot her some bail she did make a good strategic move immediately after cuz she married Damon or at least they they wanted to get married but they couldn't get married because rero was married to serener and they can't just split up so they decide to Stage Serena's death so he can go live his life in peace as a free gay man as free of a gay man as he could be in this like world you know what I mean like not with a life and like Kingdom to tendu right but the problem with this plan is that they can't tell corus and Rise that it's staged so corus and Rise who literally just lost Lena become obviously convinced that rera and Damon killed Lora so that they could be together so they are heated as far as they concerned they have lost their two children at least their man children they have a child left their two children Lenor and Lena his family is smoke so when episode 8 begins Damon and rer already have two sons aegon and viseris which is funny by the way that she named her son aegon when Allison's son that she so badly wants to be air his name is aegon already that's so funny it's almost like decided that her Aon is irrelevant you know but speaking of Allison's son Aon he is a whole degenerate Predator rapist now Allison goes around covering his tracks by implicitly manipulating and threatening the women to keep them quiet it's so crazy to me that this degenerate son of hers that she thinks is a degenerate is who she is bending over backwards to try to make king and that's how I know that all of this is jealousy for her none of this has anything to do with her son and everything to do with her resentment for rera but like I said when episode 8 begins rera has two new kids and Reise is not seeing corus in 6 years because he's been at War at Sea and now she's being told that was injured really badly and he may not make it back alive now because they don't know whether corus is going to make it that would mean that someone lucaris as it currently stands would need to ascend to the throne if he dies and corus's brother is not having it so he request a herring in front of viseris to change the line of secession for drift Mark so then rera and Damon go to viseris to hopefully try to convince him to support them since corus's brother is challenging Lucas's claim but Lord I told yall last episode that viseris was literally the living dead and now he is rotting alive like oh verer is down so bad it is it is honestly a sad sight to see and it's hard for rera and Damon to see themselves they hadn't seen him for a long time because they left the kingdom about 6 years earlier to go to Dragon stone at this point Allison and Otto have pretty much taken over the kingdom they have him hopped up on poppy all the time and they are running the show and dog is just sad to see it it's just sad to see viseris going out like this because for all his flaws he comes off like a he's a very kind-hearted man deserve better man he's the only white powerful Monarch I ever had some sympathy for poor guy so rera goes to rise to try to convince her to support her against corus's brother's challenge she even promises to have her sons jeris and lueras marry Lena's daughters Baya and Raina but I want to remind yall rise still thinks that Damon and rera killed Lor so she tells her to kick okay so rera goes one last time to a dying viseris to try to plead with him to defend her so then comes the Herring and Otto is sitting on the iron throne in place of his sis listening to corus's brother Lord vayman throw nothing but dirt on lucerys and jer's name okay then in a shocking turn of events it makes it very clear that it's been quite some time than anybody seeing viseris like on official King duties because he appears and when I say that man hobbled himself to the throne using his every last bit of energy to defend his daughter I know that's right I know that's right I honestly might have teared up the first time I watched it I I honestly think this episode I was crying and I was boohoo a little bit for viseris B I fell for viseris B my heart my heart was hurt it genuinely moves me how much viseris loves rera and values being a father to rero it's a nice thing to see in this world where people don't see their children as anything more than legacies and political pwns you know so viseris literally drags himself all the way to the Iron Throne where he tosses Otto off and he says I'm not going to say it a again okay my daughter is the air her sons are valyrians that's it it's settled drift Mark is theirs and even even though rise don't with rera and Damon and she literally had just finished telling rera she was not going to support her when visera specifically asked rise what her husband corus would have wanted she told the truth that corus wanted drift Mark to pass to lucerys and she announces that rera intends to marry jeris and lueras to Raina and Baya but remember I told y'all Lord corus's Brother vayan was already up there throwing dirt on jeras and Lucas's name and he done got so comfortable doing that because ofto and Allis it that when this happens he starts talking bold crazy again I mean like hot cash he starts talking so much [ __ ] that you you know what you'll see you'll see roll it you break law and centuries of tradition to install your daughter's Heir yet you dare tell me who deserves to inherit the name valarian that is no true valarian her children are bastards we have your tongue for that the last really noteworthy thing that happened in the episode is that when viseris is on his deathbed he thinks he's talking to rera about a dream he had he's talking about her and her son Aon right and how they're supposed to be air he's actually talking to Allison and Allison pretends to believe that as far as I'm concerned she's pretending okay she knows good and well that viseris has never wanted her child to be air she knows he doesn't want Aon to be air she knows that that she knows that the man has done said that to her every day of her life including today that day so anyway she acts like she believed he was telling her to son his death bed that he really wanted her aegon to be air he son to be air and so then viseris dies this entire episode 9 is literally just Team Green working over time to supplant renea's air and put Aon on the throne before rera is even made aware her father is dead and like when I say working overtime I mean bending over backwards okay they literally go as far as to imprison Lords who wouldn't swear allegiance to them and killed them but you know who did Get Out Alive Big Boss rise she wasn't going for it and unlike rera she remembered that she had a dragon and no time to play what I find worth noting about this scene is how aegon didn't want to be king and then he got a little taste of that power and immediately leaned into it and second I love my girl rise like that's really my [ __ ] I think rise is the most unsung Gangsta of the whole show but I hate how she had had every opportunity to kill the high Towers but she didn't because why why why do we just kill these [ __ ] people suppos are their lives too valuable for you to kill okay but you know whose lives obviously weren't valuable all the poor people she literally crushed to death under the way literally let the whole floor collapse underneath them and then her Dragon proceeded to walk across them and kill them no problem with that no problem with that if there's ever a time you're going to know that the lives of poor people don't me and [ __ ] is when you watching any anything that involves any kind of Royal monarchy child so then rise flies all the way to Dragon Stone to let rera and Damon know that exactly what she always told her what happened has happened and rainy's better than me she better than me because for all that I had lost and for as arrogant and cocky as rera had been when she tried to warn her 11 years earlier I would have simply killed Allison and them and took the throne for myself or at the at the bare minimum I was given lo I told you so yeah dummy yeah what was that remember when you was talking hot cash you thought it was just going to roll over and let you be let you be Queen a told you dummy but rise let them know what was up and somehow they had not at all prepared for the most inevitable moment the most inevitable moment that people like rise had been telling her to prepare for her entire life but I told y'all adult rera lacks a lot of the fighting spirit that young rera had so she's not even sure she wants to go to war at all Otto and M come to come offer her a certain kind of deal like hey if you bend the knee in a certain amount of time we'll will spare you and your family and she's thinking about it even though Damon's like [ __ ] no ain't nothing to think about war [ __ ] like get in the game but I guess R not trying to be so hotheaded she starts trying to be strategic but it's exactly that strategic thinking that gets up okay because you would think you would think that to rera the most vulnerable people right now would be her children that Allison and Team Green have always hated so certainly now more than ever she wants to keep her children close protect them as much as she humanly can no no but yet when jerus just like his mother rera did back in episode one remember that moment I highlighted He suggests that rera send them him and his brother lucerys on dragons to get some messages to her potential allies and she actually agrees to it in the time where her children are most vulnerable that's the time where she wants to send them gallivanting through the sky on dragons to go parlay with people who may or may not choose to align with her boy have you lost your mind cuz I'll help you find it and thus Begins the most traumatic [ __ ] I think I have seen on TV since like honestly I don't I don't this this [ __ ] hurt me I dog she sends sweet baby angel lucerys on Dragon back on his small baby dragon to go meet with one of these potential allies and as soon as he pull up in the yard what he see big ass fagar okay Lena's old dragon that now belongs to evil Wicked one ey bastard you know I'm just realizing remember earlier when I pointed out Lis in the disabled villain Trope I'm only just noticing that they made aan the most wicked also becomes disabled right with like losing the eye look at it I'm on to y'all he sees vagar parked in the yard so he knows amend is there and Lord knows I wish he had just turned back and went home right then I wish he had seen it and laugh immediately when he does finally go to leave Aiden chases him through the sky and it it's really just too painful to discuss just watch just watch I can't it's just it's too much just watch serve me no go out I Hon honestly cannot do it justice just so much I hate aiman so I'm just going to play you my actual live reaction to the premiere when I saw it my nerves on me but I really need this little boy to get on this dragon and fly away this one ey to come in Lord I wouldn't be shocked if he chased him in the sky is he away safely no man they still have us watching him about to fly after him oh Lord this Slither in about to fly mother it's a terrible journey in the sky oh please don't let a show up don't let the lightning take the they following him in the sky hey he following him in the sky a follow himing a following him mother Dre I knew this was following him I so [ __ ] mad I am so [ __ ] mad I'm so mad first of all not this onee playing like like he don't know like you didn't like you was out to kill him why you act in Shar oh I shock I shock he get gobbled up by my dragon who I tell gobble him up like but you know what I don't like R been be listen rera has been being [ __ ] since the minute they've transferred her to these adult years she costed that b she cost her child dead I don't understand what the [ __ ] you have the Dragon for if you ain't aing like on fire you talk oh when the dragons go to war Everything Burns burn that down burn it down D do what you have to do what the [ __ ] somebody needs to be the one that say so I'm going to go ahead and say it after this episode The tarians and the valerians are [ __ ] they're [ __ ] yes yes they're [ __ ] sugar [ __ ] a waste of dragons I mean the amount of times they had their enemies in their sites lights Ste up I don't understand I don't mother and so what I supposed to feel like what that that big hold on hold on this reneo cuz your child dad he dead you want to have all kind of evil GL the time to do EV was beforeand she had Auto high tower right no wait oh this a bunch of R has made me so [ __ ] mad she almost had me rooting for domestic violence I was like At first I got to be like damn it and I was like you know what you making sense choke this out cuz she ain't she Ain [ __ ] Focus she ain't Focus she ain't focused it's war time baby it's War like that's that's highy an embarrassment son like that's an embarrassment how you let your son get clipped off rip off rip War ain't even starting you down a son you down a prince my you already down a prince the Army don't stand a CH I mean my gone [ __ ] God you don't know to protect the who is said who the sends the princess off as a messenger boy make it make sense make it Mak fcking sense she Ronda play deliberating whether not she should go to war when War alreadying start girl you focus usurped you war is here okay here are some of my final thoughts I know that we team black members are not supposed to say this but all of this could have and would have been avoided if Aeris didn't Panic for absolutely no reason and name rera air and then double triple and quadr druple down on it even after he had a wife and a son I appreciate the father he was trying to be a rero and I deeply like viseris as a character and I think the actor did an amazing job and the reason I really like the character is because you don't often see powerful men depicted as prioritizing family overpower but in this case viseras tried to and it cost him and everyone around him but stupider than naming rera air in the first place was marrying the daughter of his power hungry hand in the first place or for not questioning how Allison ended up in his Chambers in the first place and to continue allowing them positions of power in his kingdom even after their hatred for his daughter became clear surely he should have understood the danger he was putting his daughter in right if not earlier at least when Allison pulled out a [ __ ] knife on her and slashed her surely he should have gotten that after he died his daughter and her children would be in danger no all that being said [ __ ] Allison Allison Otto and all her kids okay I mean maybe not Helena but her too by associ while I am annoyed that rera brought on the loss of lucer by not having a head in the game much earlier understand that I'm going to be locked in to see her Rock their [ __ ] next season okay and I hope yall lock in and watch it with me all in all Justice For lucaris Justice for Harwin Laris strong sir Christen Cole and the high towers as a staff as a record label and as a mother crew and if you want to be down with them hey you too okay take
