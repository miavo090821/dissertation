    "text": "My old boss is a white man and he went to Coachella in 2018 and he was able to see Beyonce. He was never a fan and still technically isn’t but he told me that he understands why people love Beyonce! He was like “I didn’t know any of the words but I was dancing along and had a good time” lol anyways he said her live performance changed his perspective and he appreciates her as an artist",

        "text": "It’s funny cause she’s never been my fav (was too young to appreciate the glory that was having Destiny’s Child in my youth and also like 3 fire albums in my preteen years), but I watched a concert one time with my mom back in the 2010s on tv, one of the big ones, and it was the most insane experience ever. She looked like a golden goddess twirling on the edge of the stage with the whole world roaring. I remember being like oh my gosh. No WONDER people are so crazy about her. That is a  s t a r \nThen many years later Lemonade came out and I loved it SO much that I almost became part of the Hive lmao. I was just like I’m in, I’d always thought she was stunning but I was like if it’s like this yall I have been blind to the wonders of Beyoncé. She never again hit what I saw in Lemonade and I think it’s just because I personally wanted what I saw. The aesthetic, the beats, the righteous cold anger of a woman who had sacrificed everything. Gorgeous fashion. Black culture. I was just entranced. And I made the mistake of thinking if she didn’t do that again it was inferior. But like…the other day I heard Deja Vu and I was like we did not appreciate what we had growing up 😭",

All four albums were the best project in the category each year they were nominated. The quality of Cowboy Carter was the peak of the year. From the track list, to the vocals, the instrumentation, the story, the cultural impact, the performance potential. The quality is ALWAYS there. And I’m not even a hive member!

    "text": "2:03 The craziest part about the Babyface/Chappell Roan situation is that (aside from it just being a rude thing to do to anyone) it was dumb as hell from a professional sense for those interviewers to do that. Babyface has access to a lot of artist these hosts would kill to have an exclusive interview with. (For context) Babyface is the kind of artist that if Chappell had an album flop or couldn't figure out how to finish her next album, her label would beg Babyface to come in and save the day.\n\nP.S. Streisand would definitely get a ton of outrage as well. She may not be as recognizable to the younger generations as Babyface (only because his biggest impact is still very recent) however all real musicheads and students/lovers of music (even young ones) know that she is legit (solid film career as well).",

So seeing people strip her more overtly sexual music from her iconic discography has me extra heated. \n\nNo hate to this group but i felt like lt was missing from the conversation aside from  a mention of lesbianism at 59:42 by Rebecca Azor \n\nDark skinned Black women already have to fight for recognition - being queer and loud about it makes shit even harder. Because white queer women will flock to other white women but overlook or insult doechii. \n\nDoechii also takes the time to bring other folks up with her without disparaging sex work, gender non-conforming and trans folks, and acknowledging where she comes from. Janelle monáe is in thst same loud and queer umbrella being nonbinary is still recent as hell too and most folls just default to she/her and try to erase that queerness too - and Janelle still mostly gets nominated without winning. \n\nYeah, Cardi is Bi but she doesnt talk about it much, distances herself from sex workers, and the WAP performance was made for the male gaze, not for queer women. I give Cardi a lot of credit and i understand that shes a person - she shouldnt have to stand for things as a token. And thats why giving flowers to out queer and Black artists who choose to lift up the queer community matters a lot. It can be both",

SHE should've got a pulitzer for it. and it's so satisfying that cowboy carter finally won, when country is a notoriously racist and exclusionary genre that has intentionally erased its own history of working class solidarity and its roots in struggle and was NEVER willingly gonna take her seriously. being a Black woman grounding her country album in histories of struggle and Black cowboys that were erased was an uphill climb & she deserved this win in a way few artists ever could. kendrick gets all the credit for consciouness raising because he's in rap and can pull on that tradition for immediate recognition. she's doing it from scratch in any genre she chooses. it's just excellent. nobody can take Beyonce's artistry from her",

There is nowhere on THIS planet, at least, that a young, up-and-coming black journalist could get a job at AP or in music journalism and be *permitted* to not have some inkling of who Barbara Streisand was and her impact or stature, whether or not they 'identified' with her or found her \"sooo relatable\" or whatever.\n\nThe hypothetical that the (bottom left?) panelst introduced was not only absurd but incredibly irritating to hear. (And I get so tired of people telling me what they 'relate to' or what they 'identify' with as if it is a legitimate argument.)\n\nShe was there in the capacity of a journalist and interviewer...not a swooning fan girl. She is not being paid to put us on notice about who she personally identifies with. \n\nAnd that is precisely where white entitlement enters the fray. They always think that how they feel in any given moment and what they personally like is of vital importance and at the center of the universe; worse, everyone around them rushes to indulge them in this nonsense which is why they think its no big deal or acceptable.\n\nDon't care how she got there and if she's a nep hire or social media personality. The job is the job, and if she's not qualified or able to do it, then she needs to get trained or step aside and let someone more qualified into the role.\n\nWe need to stop making excuses for these people when the entire world already rushes to coddle them.\n\nAnd also...why interview someone you know nothing about? It's her JOB to do due diligence and basic research if she doesn't know. 🙄",

    "text": "People who don't see the artistry of Beyonce just don't see it. And I'm not here to convince them of anything. But creating what essentially is an Afrofuturist reimagining of country and related genres, one in which black people were never excised from the genre, so our sounds of today are incorporated and weaved into the classic counds of Americana, country, folk? That's vision and artistry that few people can match in music right now. Beyonce remains one of the few artists in pop music that respects the album as a medium to tell a unified story and make a clear argument, and not just as a package of singles. And rewarding her for the album that epitomizes that philosophy the most makes sense to me. She absolutely deserved it for Self-titled, Lemonade, and Renaissance, and sonically, I do like some of those albums more than Cowboy Carter (it's very close, tbh) but artistry-wise, this album honestly is the most deserving of the bunch in my eyes.",
