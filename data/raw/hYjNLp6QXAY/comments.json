        "text": "He’s responsible for most of the bad blood between the UK and Ireland. The vitriol is usually directed towards the monarchy but it’s Cromwell who did most the damage whilst the monarchy was exiled on the continent. I know the tudors weren’t the kindest but Cromwell took the cake!\nDon’t forget Cromwell was a puritan the most extreme form of protestant. The puritans sacked the monarchy because they saw it as an excess they even closed all the taverns and theatres!! They then went on their campaign of extreme religious reform for the worse for the whole of the British isles (which historically has always included the island or Ireland) it’s no wonder the commonwealth of England only lasted a decade. When parliament invited Charles 11 back to London to take up court wearing his cavalier silks with his entourage in tow London sprang back to life instantly.  it was as almost as if the whole interregnum hadn’t happened even though it’s lasting effects are still felt on both sides of the water today. Add  those horrible Victorian famines and the 20th century and you get to where we are today. There’s still so much bad blood but at the same time we share blood more than any other 2 nations on the planet how many UK families have an Irish branch or vice versa? \n🇬🇧  🇮🇪",

Who gives a fuck if he says 'inappropriate' things? He's not a politician which is the whole point. The alternative is supporting kiddy sniffer Biden, war with Russia and Syria, critical race theory and intersectional social justice.",
