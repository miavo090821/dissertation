yeah not not really sure to make this because i don't think anyone's really sure what to make of it but because it's looking like a joe biden victory boris has come out and congratulations mr president-alike could we do that trade deal by the way because yeah so donald trump's been extremely supportive for the last before before we yeah so what's the status of brexit at the moment because this is this is why this applies to britain why this is relevant to us so what do we have we have till january the first to do the one with the eu so i try to deal with the eu which um apparently they're renegotiating more today like they after accepting that joe biden's probably going to win they send people back and uh what was boris's words on this that there were still significant differences remain within the eu uk trade deal so they're not they're not really sure whether they're going to get one is what i'm getting from that right which means probably not um but the the backup for that was always oh well donald trump loves us he's very keen to do a trade deal you know we'll provide more military support and in return we get free trade with them therefore we don't really need the eu that much because they're our second our first biggest partner by country second by block yeah um but that that doesn't look so good now so the eu is probably going to feel pretty pretty stoked about this yeah and want to impose harsher terms on the uk because they probably can now so we we seem to have been put significantly on the back foot um we've even got some examples of how um biden doesn't really seem to like britain very much does he no i mean he's not keen on britain or all brexit really um neither was his predecessor uh obama so first of all the most famous thing with obama is didn't he take out the bust of winston churchill from the white house i believe he did yeah and i believe that donald trump put it back didn't he yeah hmm did it really like his argument was it was racist or something like that presumably presumably but donald trump put it back because it's a significant narrative event in the heroic story of the west you know it signifies allyship and struggle against communism well fascism that's the special relationship right there that is that is the the understanding that there is a basis of a common political ideal yeah because i mean the relationship before the second world war i mean i imagine it was cordial but the u.s was still writing plans about how to invade the british empire i mean we had burned down their white house at one point yeah 100 years before but but after world war two it's been you know as close as you can get absolutely but uh yeah so barack obama also not great on this because he was flown out uh to the uk i think it was for an official visit and then my understanding is david cameron met with him and david cameron wanting us to remain yeah basically slipped a fiver or something and said to him you need to back us on there so he came out and gave the statement that the uk would not be at the front of the queue for a trade deal they'd be in the back of the queue to try and discourage us from voting no i don't know whether no one cares about obama's opinion on that yeah but i i don't know whether or not he held that sincerely or it was just a favor to the what he thought would be the prime minister anyway but it's it's not a good uh uh signal yeah but joe biden being his vp we can probably take those it's probably going to be significantly thinking about brexit yeah a continuation but the thing is it's not just that that i think is significant in his thinking there's a lot more with joe himself well do you want to go into some of it yeah so the first thing that news came out today was that joe brydon's uh staff had spoken to some news agencies and said that the uk us trade deal is not a priority for him so not not keen or at least not showing he's interested in us which sends a signal oh crap though it was nicer when trump was in charge and we were at the front of the queue yup yep it was and there's also this bit where um his staff had also spoken to the guardian and they said that biden regarded brexit as a significant mistake after a biden victory and a failure to reach a trade deal with the eu the uk would occupy a lonely place in the world that's a direct quote from biden there we call it splendid isolation that's what we call it yeah nothing understands that so there's also there's also something that happened uh two days ago now that i found really interesting uh joe biden was like on his way out of a meeting room or whatever and he's surrounded by the press and someone from the bbc was there trying to get his attention and uh he was like where are you from and they said the bbc and he just looks at the smile and says i'm irish and then walks off and i was quite shocked i mean that kind of implies a kind of long-standing ethnic hatred that he feels that the irish maybe have against the british and that he being a virus descent uh has to hold up i mean and it seems to be a kind of similar position to one taken by the ira like a signifi a genuine sort of racist view uh genuine bigotry oh you're the british broadcasting operation sorry i'm irish the problem with that though is like he's so senile i don't even know if he's cracking a joke or not because you can you can see him smiling and some people have said oh no he was making a joke he was just saying oh you know i'm irish you know yeah mess with you guys but that's not i mean the bb convincing and it's not like the bbc can be considered to be a like patriotic british establishment these days an institution you know like they'll probably go yeah we hate britain too [Laughter] solidarity conrad um but it's it's worse than that because um i mean these photos have been around forever but they're obviously making more light now him with jerry adams holding hands i don't know if you see on that one i haven't seen that one but i'm not surprised i've seen you afterwards i i believe he's trying to um make an appearance with the good friday agreement yeah and you know nancy pelosi and him have both cameler actually as well or is it carmilla kamala she'll kill me if i say it wrong but uh all three of them have come out and said any messing with the good friday agreement would be uh meaning that a trade deal with the u.s would be off the table and we're not planning on messing with the good friday agreement at all so what why need to threaten us with this other than taking a stance that you're doing the wrong thing here you need to abandon brexit or at least you should not have done this so the democrat entire party doesn't seem to be in favor of us and i i don't know if this is down some kind of like democratic caucus that's uh of irish people in the in the democratic party or something like i'm imagining levo democrat you know plastic paddies that aren't really irish but just say they're irish no there are probably a lot of catholics who um who don't vote democrat i don't know the percentages yeah we'd have to go and investigate that but uh but the thing i felt um not a friend no not not a friend i mean it's it's been sad watching the conservatives come to this realization yeah you know boris put out a statement saying congratulations joe biden boris calm down it's not over yet uh and so did dominic grubb in fact i i felt kind of um i feel kind of bad for rob actually he reported by am that he uh he said the us has no greater ally or dependable friend than the uk as downing street professor joe biden he was excited to work with biden and confidently the uk would be able to smooth any fears he might have a good friday agreement how it relates to brexit it's like no it's convincing yes not convincing and he's clearly hedging yeah very oh oh no no don't be silly we always hated trump we were always expecting a biden victory we're so glad you're in charge because we're going to work with you very this started happening like seven days ago or something as well yeah literally literally you know the second the the media was calling i think it was savage javed put an article or i retweeted someone an article that's saying that you know joe brydon would be a great partner for the uk and we ought to support him and blah blah blah blah blah savage used to be the chancellor he got kicked out by boris for trump's jacket yeah and then all of a sudden boris put out a memo to all the ministers saying form ties with the biden administration because we're expecting them to win which is probably a prudent thing to do i mean if they were looking at the mail in balloting and thinking crap some of them already come in they haven't been sent yet they've got the early results yeah yeah exactly yeah but you know if if there's an election you probably should form types of both sides for the interest of britain over party politics but it it seems to be like their understanding that they've now lost that tie with trump especially now and they've got no one but themselves to blame you had four years from brexit start date to this election which you've put in joe biden of pure you know pure trump you could have had a great great deal with him at any point i imagine four years and instead they spent it wasting about what do we really want to do breaklet should we have a couple of generals and then we'll figure out what we want to do fine your fault you're full there's no one else to blame here you can't blame the labour party you can't blame any u.s administration no yes another example of the conservative party disappointing the brexiteers yeah yeah i don't think this is gonna be the last no it's it's not [Music] you
