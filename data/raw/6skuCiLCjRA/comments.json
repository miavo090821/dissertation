(Student, not a \"green card\" which is for guest workers.) \n\nVisas generally cannot be revoked \"for any reason\". They can be revoked for specific reasons, and the laws about what those are can actually get fairly complicated. Hence the involvement of courts. \n\nDue process is not a frivolous luxury, and its purpose is not to be a pleasant subjective experience for the accused person. Its purpose is to ensure that government agents do not get away with lying. This is exactly why it HAS to be applied in all relevant cases, not treated as a special privilege of any special class of people, including citizens as opposed to non-citizens. Ensuring it gets applied in all cases is in the self-interest of everyone in the country, because it protects us all against the risk of being victims of government corruption. \n\nIf it is actually true that Khalil incited a riot, then there will (due to the nature of riots) be a huge amount of easily obtained evidence that unequivocally proves he incited a riot. If inciting riots is a legitimate reason to revoke a legal immigrant's visa, then all the government needs to do to revoke Khalil's visa is go to a court hearing and show the judge all the evidence they collected that proves Khalil incited a riot. \n\nIf the government does not want to do this, the most likely explanation is that they know they can't prove the accusation they're making. \n\nSaying \"not everyone should get due process\" is tantamount to saying \"the government should be allowed to get away with making false accusations at least some of the time.\" \n\nIs that really what anyone making this argument believes?",

Due process, in regards to immigration, is the process to determine whether someone is or isn't supposed to be here. Arguing we shouldn't give these people due process means any administration could grab citizens off the street and deport them without a trial because they never proved to a judge that the person was here illegally. There is a process we're supposed to follow for deportation, and that process is meant to protect us, not the illegals. Do you really want to risk giving a potential far-left future president the power to send citizens off to foreign prisons with no evidence of wrong-doing? Of course not. \n\nIn the case of Khalil, he was not deported by a judge. The administration deported him without proving in a court of law that he should not be here. They even admitted that he was deported by mistake before doubling down on not allowing him back.\n\nI'm always amazed that you people claim to love the constitution and yet you clearly understand none of it.

I think the donations are made as a way to expose the double standard we have in our culture, that donating to a kid who killed his fellow highschool is okay, but donating to someone who called a kid the n word isnt?\n\nIts like they arent doing it to protect or enable racial discrimination, but potentially to push back on rampant political correctness and cancel culture, as a way to moreso protect her freedom of speech, as people are too quick to “make you famous” for (relatively) minor offenses",

Especially since the same \"free speech absolutists\" shit themselves if you burnt a flag in front of them or think shit talking the troops should get you kicked out of the country or think anything involving LGBTQ+ concepts should be removed from public life in all forms.

Is \"perpetuating the United States at all is what is fucking us over\" a proposal to dismantle the United states specifically, or are you calling for a complete dismantling of world government? Also is \"democracy is not the only way\" a proposal for a 'good dictator' style of government or an Anarchic system?",

It's going to be replaced by a hyper-militarized police state led by either an aristo-bureaucratic oligarchy or an autocratic dictator, built around a repressive religious and/or ethnonationalist ideology. We were halfway there already 20 years ago. That's the reality we're in. \n\nCalling an analysis of the warning signs that the switch to full-blown fascism may be imminent or underway a \"terrible take\" just because you don't think liberal democracy is what you'd choose as an imagined ideal system of government makes no sense. \n\nSince we're all thinking about the Weimar Republic, have you ever heard of the slogan \"Nach Hitler Uns\"?",

(from an anthropological standpoint, that is itself eurocentric) \n\nfor when we prioritize nations and legitimize rule of law in nations that have turned their back on them, i find it to be a dangerous tool for normalization,  rather than action towards actual structural change.(think the pendulum of ideology in administrations, i.e: obama, trump, biden, trump) trump is the catalyst rather than the singularity. \n\nin a post trump world, what should come next is not a return to normalcy, or a readoption of liberal democracy, it just doesnt work. especially at such a large scale like this United States project. this nation needs to be dismantled back to concepts of vast landscapes and returned to the stewards that have been displaced and disregarded. \n\nand of course the transition period will not be smooth, as it never is. but we must move forward with a different framework that prioritize the needs and interests of the collective through empowerment of land ownership and release of agriculture back to local communities. \n\n(also i see why you proposed that phrase  \"Nach Hitler Uns\" to me, and no i hadn't heard of it before but i will definitely do a deeper reading. but with the surface research for this reply i will say that's not what i'm getting at.)",

However that is a misinterpretation of fear itself. The basis of all neo-reactionary or left solidarity thought is the basis of interpretations of fear. Bataille discuses exactly what we’re talking about here. Fear as a response to transgression and determination. We’re dealing with a need for confrontation of fear, and the outcome matters, it’s not a mistake but rather a purposeful reflection. That’s why in this dialectic we find a form of fear that builds solidarity for you and mine, or a fear that’s built exclusivity and hierarchy. One confronts fear and seeks eternal address of fear while the other seeks conservation of the systems of fear, retreat into mutations to fear itself.",

Both sides just think the other is brainwashed. They just take these headlines and vague news without context and accept it as fact. \n\nExample: The news in the US (depending on what party owns them) uses suspiciously flowery language about a \"Maryland dad,\" or simplified/vague language like \"Spokane man\" in headlines to make you think that they're innocent people just caught up in Trump's tyrannical web of deportations, but court records are public. Even people in other countries can access them. I was able to find and read them; and found that the news headlines are trying to steer the narrative and make it seem like the US President is trying to detain innocent people. It took me a few clicks to find out that was a lie by the news, by omission. The sensationalism is absolutely mental with US news media.\n\nThe fact that the US has news like this, paid for by these big corporations, and that viewers just accept it as fact without thinking or asking questions, just shows me that neither party's members have any idea what they're doing or what's real. It's perpetuated by them too. They're out there spreading misinformation as if it's fact because they are either influenced by subversive activists domestically, or foreign influence by Russia or China.",

        "text": "I liken almost to even Covid. There were those who didn’t care about anything and tried to live life like normal until the virus was thrust into their lives, either putting them or a loved one into the ICU. Things suddenly got very real for them, but for even a small few they still didn’t care. \n\nThis time around it will be all the effects of what Trump puts in place. Some will love the tariffs but then will feel it via inflation, shortages in stores, job loss due to mass layoffs, etc. Some will look the other way when protestors or people of a certain background get arrested by the cops or certain agencies until one day they are arrested for absolutely nothing or for something they do that is now deemed illegal.\n\nThis type of behavior will really get tested under this administration. It’s why I take everything Trump floats around as serious. Take the third term for example. When I looked it up for fun probably a year ago there was already debate about the what-if scenario of Trump being someone’s VP, they resign or something, then he serves out the term. A year later such a discussion comes up again and that VP issue was the center of it all and taken somewhat more seriously rather than a joke. I truly feel this administration will simply test everything we take for granted even if they fail in their endeavors. It’s almost a danger to have the mindset of, “Oh that’ll never happen,” while it happens in some form with this administration.",

        "text": "​@WeezaY5000Exactly. America has always been diverse. It was a country of Natives, women, Black folks both free and enslaved, etc. but built only on the vision and wisdom (supposed wisdom, I personally found it hard to call any type of person who can entertain even the discussion of a 3/5 compromise intelligent) of wealthy entitled, arrogant, bigoted, white men with property who believed they were smarter and better equipped to rule than people lower than them (almost as is they still believed in \"divine rights\"--aka \"merit\" ). If you look around today in terms of who has power and you see that not much has changed. What would the Constitution look like if women, indigenous folks, Black folks were able to contribute their visions and wisdom in creating the founding documents? What would the country look like if it was actually founded as an inclusive democracy where everyone is created equal? I'm going to speculate that we probably wouldn't be knee deep in fascism if that were the case.\n\nI'm tired of being told over and over again that it's irrational to change the Constitution or that I'm crazy for thinking it's one of the US's biggest problems. The basic foundation of this country is flawed and the sooner people recognize how stupid it is to keep trying to hold onto a vision of this country built by mediocre white men almost 300 years ago, the better equipped we'll be to identify real solutions based on conditions today and not 300 years ago.",

It wears a “terms of service.”\n\nWhat should you do? Simple but not easy:\n\n\n * Speak plainly, even when it's unfashionable.\n * Refuse to mistake collective emotion for truth.\n * Stop outsourcing your sense of danger to fictional scripts and algorithm-curated feeds.\n * Build something real: thinking, skills, community, clarity.\n\nYou asked how we’ll know it’s real? You'll know when saying what you're saying now comes with a cost higher than being called a “bot.” The irony is that by quoting fiction instead of analyzing facts, many are welcoming that future with open arms.\n\nYou wanted to live in a meaningful time?

You can contrast this by the exit surveys done by Native New Online which has a much better breakdown. However this best one sofar is the following. According to the document posted by the First Nations Development Institute in collaboration of AARC and BSP, most voted for Harris, even young men mostly voted for Harris. Those that spoke their native languages. has a strong majority to harris, while those that don't have a simple majority. This was done much after the election and with better representation of the different tribes. The exit polls seem funny because more right wings sources say a slim majority voted for Trump while unaligned, centrist and left leaning reported a clear majority.  But the problem with the exit polls is that it is not representative enough and the sample was much smaller than the one by AARC and BSP.",

But he was factually wrong.\n\nGreed never passed, power was never returned to the people. Men died, and liberty kept dying with it.\n\nGreed never passed because the capitalist machine marched full steam ahead. Each decade saw privatisation increase and public funding decrease. It saw taxes on the wealthy decrease and taxes on the worker increase. Then came neoliberalism and so began the great transfer of wealth from the working class to the top 1%. We are in the final throes of that transfer now and we are facing an economic collapse that may just dwarf that of 1929.\n\nWhen the war ended, evil was not defeated - a single evil was defeated. But a few great evils remained. Fascism never died, it went into hiding and it did so in the United States, Russia and Britain. Immediately after the war ended, Britain established Israel, and facilitated their century long genocide.\n\nThe U.S continued to facilitate Jim Crow in the South and barbaric segregation in the North. The eugenics that Hitler enforced were used in the United States during this time. Black boys were lynched. Some had their body parts removed and were consumed by these ravenous mobs. During the same time, the U.S was also supporting South Africa's (my country) apartheid regime. Reagan and Thatcher were undying supporters of what we did here because their benefactors wanted to emulate it again in Britain and the U.S.\n\nCurrently, the U.S is helping Russia, a fascist state, to take over Ukraine. They are empowering Israel, a fascist state, in finishing their genocide of Palestinians and they have been for nearly a century. The U.S toppled countless Democratic governments because the goals of those governments did not align with the capital interests of their benefactors.\n\nAntisemitism is on the rise, has been for a while, and we picked up on it too late with Charlottesville. And now a fascist regime has taken hold of the most militarily powerful nation on the planet, whom nobody will challenge simply because of mutually assured destruction.\n\nWhat Hitler dreamed of, is now being fulfilled through a vassal state, the United States. The U.S will finish what Hitler started. The Nazis never died, they weren't defeated, they merely retreated and they rebuilt and planned and have now taken over. And now they have evolved into something far more robust and terrifying. Now it is not just the Jew, the Romani, the homosexual, the Freemason, the feeble, the non white, that is being targeted. It is the worker, indiscriminately it is the worker. The undesirables are going to be killed and what is left? Will be made slaves. With the erosion of labour rights and civil rights, employees will become property.\n\nWhat we are in for will dwarf what Germany did. What we are in for is the vengeance of the failed third reich.",

The Great Depression directly caused the rise of fascists and the deadliest war in human history but the worst capitalist crisis since then in the 08 Recession and COVID-19 as well as the imperialist policies and climate change leading to mass migration has absolutely no contribution towards the rise of the right across nearly every western liberal democracy. Just gotta hope the liberals will eventually reform capitalism and push back the rising tide of fascism.",

This was 1939, just before the outbreak of WW2. \n\nThis is not to encourage you to make a bomb and carry out terrorism. But see how close this simple man came to changing the course of history.

While writing for example literal ROA guys into this list.\nI can do the same, because of capitalism, 50 millions a year die earlier by 10 years at least and more, basically considering capitalism eradicates 50 millions a year.\nHow so? Smoking, Alkohol and other addictions eradicating 11 million at least, self-isekai, murderings because somebody is uneducated and poor and resorts to robbing people,damn literal 9 millions because of damn famine,like what year is this? 1000? Also heart-blood vessel related ones, in most cases if medecine were more accessible and less profit-aimed, most of those people haven'td perished  today, and did this in 2035 for example. i can continue until i finally reach 50 mills a year, like literally even this has more logic than stories about evil stalin eating children and sending to gulags everyone.",

Right now they're crying for government bailouts. If those bailouts don't come, they're all gonna fold. This is exactly what happened during Trump's first term, this time it's just more radical and unrestrained.\n\nI'm just not sure if I really believe it's on purpose like you do because I just can't bring myself to believe Trump et al are really playing proverbial 4D-chess like that.",

They were criminals. They were arrested and detained multiple times for charges that would get anyone sent to prison for decades. Garcia was denied asylum twice for proven gang membership by a CI; then found to be doing human trafficking and was let off because the feds under Biden told the state police to not detain him, in 2022. His cohort ratted him out to get leniency this year bc Garcia's trafficking car was traced to him and he snitched. \n\nDiaz has an assault and a sexual assault conviction on his record, and now he's facing 20 years in prison for assaulting an ICE agent when they came to serve a deportation order. This was an order that was already issued and was delayed for years. His wife tried to weasel her way in and grant him residency by marriage, but his record means he can never be granted even that.\n\nLiterally just do some simple googling dude. You're being told stories by people who barely read headlines and simplify everything down to a point where it's incorrect.

Crimes of the past don't justify the current ones. The \"spirit of the Constitution\" part was added by me to empathize the very obvious problem of mass scale actions in general, even beyond the point of them being ACTUALLY ILLEGAL in this case. Seriously, read the fifth amendment. \nThe context is, Trump going \"hey do I need to follow the law as written in Constitution if it's really inconvenient\". Yes,yes he absolutely does and even asking that raises red flags.\n\nP.S. even if the problem boiled down to the \"Spirit of the Constitution\" and not it's ACTUAL TEXT,there is Supreme Court to rule on that and decide if something goes against or according to the Constitution even if it's not explicitly written (which in this case, it IS WRITTEN, I repeat). But for that, you need to go with due process. And also,there are ways to do due process without making thousands of individual cases,such as class action case, but Trump never cared for following the law. Or they could have set the precedent on the basis of the individual case,which American law also does.",

Questioning how a law applies is not the same as saying you don't have to follow it. That's basic reasoning.\n\nAnd no, this situation isn't unique.

It also prohibits detaining them en masse without due process.\nThe current administration was unable to classify this situation as public danger to ignore due process,which already speaks volumes on how they can actually afford the time for trials but simply don't care.

Then, in the same breath, you declare it “literally illegal” as if your personal reading of the Fifth Amendment is self-enforcing. That’s not how law works. Courts, not comment sections, determine illegality.\n\nSecond, you claim Trump ignored a court order. If that’s true - and that’s a big if - then cite the case. Not just your recollection of an article or a tweet, but the actual ruling. If a court order was defied and nothing happened, that’s a scandal of the system - not a proof that everything is ipso facto illegal just because you believe it should be.\n\nThird, you claim Trump didn’t articulate himself well, so we should interpret his remarks in the worst possible light. That’s not a legal standard, it’s a partisan reflex. “He didn’t say it the way I want, so I assume criminal intent.” That’s not argument. That’s hysteria.\n\nFinally, you say due process could be done as a class action or a precedent-based method. Good - so you’re conceding that even you think the standard procedure doesn’t need to be applied identically in every case.

        "text": "​@hataranneulastr5376 You're misapplying the Fifth Amendment by treating deportation as if it's equivalent to criminal punishment. It isn't. Deportation is a civil action, not a criminal one, a distinction upheld by the Supreme Court for over a century, starting with Fong Yue Ting v. United States (1893). That isn't some legal trick; it's foundational to how immigration law works in the U.S.\n\nDue process does apply to deportation, but not in the way you’re implying. It doesn't require jury trials, grand jury indictments, or the full apparatus of a criminal courtroom. Immigration courts exist precisely because this is a separate, civil system with its own procedures and standards.\n\nYour repeated claim that mass deportations are “literally illegal” ignores both history and jurisprudence. The U.S. has carried out mass deportations under both Republican and Democratic administrations. Courts have judged these actions on procedural grounds, how they were carried out - not on the idea that deportation itself is unconstitutional unless done with full criminal trial rights. If your reading were correct, the entire immigration enforcement framework would collapse.\n\nAs for your claim that the administration tried to invoke “wartime” powers. This part actually did happen, and it proves the opposite of your point. The Trump administration attempted to use the Alien Enemies Act to justify deporting Venezuelan nationals, calling certain gang activity an “invasion.” But the courts rejected that rationale precisely because there was no formal war or invasion. Judges ruled that due process still applied. So your example doesn't bolster your argument, it confirms that the judiciary is doing its job.\n\nI suggest you stop pretending your anger is legal expertise. Immigration law is complex, filled with trade-offs, and structured to balance national sovereignty with individual rights. You loathe the man, fine, I get it, but then say that.",

What about those in construction trades that are being priced out of jobs, companies who will not hire you because you are not willing to work for nothing, people who have only seen pay cuts since 2005 because why pay an American a good wage when you can pay a migrant half as much. My advice, when you do quit do not go into construction, do not get a trade, you will be up against people they can pay what you would receive in 1996. Do you ever think about the people really struggling because of all these people you love so much. Look at pay rate statistics from the last 25 years, look at how those at the bottom are getting screwed while those in charge get to pay starvation wages to our new underclass. You do not know how good we used to have it.",

Basically it turned into a race between a guy who took a hard stance against Trump and even managed to soften Trump's stand against Canada within two weeks of coming into power (before the national election), vs someone who was a known Trump supporter and was still a blatant Trump Jr after trying to distance himself from him.",

They all thought my ideas were incredibly unique and surreal - tbh I had just thought \"what if everything goes to shit by taking the things that worry me irl to grimdark extremes?\"\nIt was such a delightful, innocent time. \n\nNow we (and particularly my US players) watch in abject horror as our little game dystopia turns into reality in the US under the Bronzer in Chief. \n\nMark my words, any day now eldritch entities will start wreaking havoc. And *that* would be sweet relief, because then we could know we're just having a nightmare. Alas. \n\n...as a historian, I am fundamentally opposed to the idea of living during an important period. Important never means peaceful and boring. 😳",

    "text": "Well, I'm 18, I graduate in 10 days. Yet I feel like that accomplishment is completely overshadowed by never being able to see the freedoms I was promised. I've always believed in leftist teachings and equity for all, a better country for all. I came out as trans at 12 to a supportive family, and many people I knew outside of that bubble were hateful. The difference now, is rather than that hate being marginalized and small. It's almost half this country too stupid and too proud to see that a man, maybe not even going to live his 2nd term end; is determining the future of us youth. In the Pledge of Alliance I did every morning, \"Indivisible, liberty and justice for all,\" was just something we must've blindly chanted--so many people I know have lost their way and forget that those 'immigrants', those black communities, us trans folks, LGBTQ+, and even themselves at points; are humans too. What type of human creates cruelty quite like this? Divides a country found on openness and morals of freedom? Fascists. Dictators, people who want their word to be law. I want to fight, I'm not afraid to lay down my life to salvage the American Dream for people younger than I. But the odds are, as a Native American, they'd just lump me in with the 'immigrants' and ship me off somewhere to die. Aren't I too young to die for human rights? So here I wait. Waiting quietly, with lack of options for it to be my turn on the chopping block, I'm not white or cis afterall. What place do I have in an America that is built for the white straight man? I wish we could have America for all, that white straight man too, as long as everyone does their part I say. But the rights aren't for rights I suppose. May God, our true God, not the one the rights claim to pray to nightly; have mercy on us astray Americans when our judgment comes to pass.",

    "text": "I was not even aware of still being subscribed here, and I used to be signed up via Patreon. But I do agree that it is difficult to keep track of all insanities launched at once. But I have watched a video by Mallen Baker recently which illustrates why Trump will fail, but why its successor could be worse. The problem is that people try to justify it calling fascism based on factors, whereas the opposition, to use a kinder word, doesn't shy away from calling everyone opposing them a Marxist or communist. We need to loosen up a little. The categories are made by us, we can adapt and expand a little. \n\nTrump is only a puppet, that lives in his own made up bubble, where he thinks he will be remembered well. The differences to other post-fascist leaders are:\n\na) he will not be the one earning legitimacy due to lack of own competence\nb) he is not the one forming a coherent party ideology (he has too many whisperers for that)\nc) he has too many weaknesses not to just serve as a puppet for the actual masters in the background, which will eventually be split into a secular hypercapitalist faction and one a hyper-religious nationalist faction bend on eliminating every individual freedoms, for now, they have some truce in place, but cracks are already beginning to show\n\nBut his own party ideologues will have nominated a more competent successor in no time before his body is cold. He will get some faux legitimacy in that his name will be uttered  to appease the rabid crowd that is still crying until he gets willfully forgotten. The reason they are trying to scram as much as possible into his presidency is possible is not just they need to throw political flash-bang grenades, they want the successor to land softly in a prepared bed. \n\nThe best thing one needs to remember if he wants to effectively counter that is that he doesn't get caught in a spider-web of lengthy individual battles, but to fight the movement as a whole. The scalpel is good for what it does, but every so often it's good to remember that there is a place for grapeshot.",
