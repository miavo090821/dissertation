i've also got a segment uh here on why corporate america is adult daycare now this might be referring to some things that you've seen going around on social media recently i don't think you've seen any of this no i haven't so it should be very interesting because um i'm going to be looking at a particular woman's tick tock which has been going around for demonstrating just the state of corporate america because it is a good insight into the lifestyles of people especially in tech in big metropolitan cities like chicago where this woman is based just to make sure as well don't dog pile on this woman or anything i'm not criticizing necessarily her personally i'm just saying that you know the lifestyle that she leads and the uh and the lifestyle of these corporate tech types is very telling if anything she's actually done us a service by showing us what it's actually like on the inside of these places so don't don't yeah and when i tell you how much she earns please don't please don't get angry please try not to but first uh just like to draw your attention to a premium live hangout that we did last night it was you and our guest luke avery talking about the wisdom of songs yeah the the song of solomon it's it's remarkable how it's it feels really out of place it's one of the books of the bible but it's not religious and it's actually really interesting when you look at the way that people's relationships are now uh there's there's something that has been taken is the best way to say it like there's a sort of depth of feeling to it between like it is a romance between two people that you just can't imagine now you know it's like the it's just such an archaic and like out of time thing that it's just remarkable to go back and study it but anyway that was what that was about yeah good that's that sounds very nice it's always good to have luke in he's always got a very interesting insight into these things and i think that old-fashioned romance and romanticism is something that we should all try to reintroduce into our lives but there's there's also timeless observations about the differences between men and women they're embedded within the text that we uh that we go through it's really interesting i think if you're going to try and be romantic to a woman you should probably understand what a woman is in the first place and the differences between men and women and yes how else are you gonna appeal to a woman if you don't anyway check that out if you're interested really good content and i would recommend it let's go on so this is the first thing that i saw regarding this this person called cold on twitter found this tick tock talking about a day in the life of a 22 year old in tech in chicago and it it raised a few eyebrows from a few people because a few people just were very myself included were very surprised just at the level of indulgence bourgeois indulgence yes that goes on in these companies now this woman works for linkedin and i'll tell you a little bit more about her in a moment after we watch this clip today was one of those days where you leave for work at 7am and you don't get back until past midnight i left for work early for a 9am meeting that was conveniently cancelled right beforehand but luckily i got to lobby and there were these eucalyptus towels waiting for me which is really nice and some fresh orange water which i of course took before taking the elevator up to the office i grabbed some breakfast normal oatmeal and chia seed pudding and we finally got linkedin mugs in the office which i'm so excited about and prep some linkedin content then i found out that the wall heart that we have in the office is made out of recycled trees from chicago which was so cool fun fact and then it was time for our company all hands so i grabbed our drink of the day which is a blackberry mojito and headed downstairs to the all hands room with some of my co-workers there weren't that many people there but listen to them sing mama mia [Music] anyways we love that song we grabbed some lunch because we were starving after that there was this cool little dish and i grabbed a chai latte before heading to work watch some of my co-workers play ping pong and then tried out a new quiet room which is a really nice area to just like relax and unplug from work then it was time to buckle down i had to get certified in our new marketing lab certification on linkedin so i did that and just like sat in our focus area for a while i grabbed a snack after i was hungry and then i finished off the rest of my work before getting an email announcing the next team that i'll be joining through my blp program it was really exciting news i'm going to be joining a marketing team what work yeah i think sometimes what did you do everyone was asking what is it that you do exactly her entitlement is like office space so what does it you say you actually do here well she prepped some linkedin content was the most i got from that so she copied and pasted a text document to the webpage right exactly well the thing is that that is her full day of work that's not the end of the video itself because the stress free life she leaves i know she was saying oh it's one of those days where you wake up really early and then you get back after midnight do you know what she did with the rest of her day after that in the video she didn't go out drinking did she she did go out drinking with all of her friends stress what difficulty the fact that she's like oh yeah the first thing that happened was the meeting i was in got cancelled so i don't have to do that then i sit around do a little what did you do for that hour you know yeah do a little bit of linkedin content and then i sat around watching my mates in the ping pong table room went in the quiet room for a while and pretended that i was in nature and then got some lunch got a mojito whatever rub my fingers against these recycled tree boards that's known as wood wood is recycled tree this this table we're sat at is made from recycled tree where did you find it carl incredible oh my god this recycled sand you've got on yeah as well it's amazing fantastic she's getting free snacks and towels meetings apparently are just optional in attendance because she went to that meeting which just seemed to be people singing mama mia yeah and like what was that meeting about how was that necessary part of the day the interesting thing is i've kind of i'm not gonna you know expose anyone but i've kind of worked in a job similar to this before not quite as you know high brow and fancy as linkedin to the point where they can just give you free like free orange water and towels that you can wipe yourself with it when you come in because apparently just i don't know getting around chicago actually it's gross yeah getting around chicago would get me in a sweat as well actually just from the nerves um uh going around any corner but yeah it's very strange but i've worked in a similar kind of job before where most of your work that you do each day is kind of pretending to do work and then you just take meeting after meeting after meeting so even if you have work to do the first half of your day will be filled up with three meetings which take up four hours making it very difficult to actually get anything done with any real efficiency but then the work that you're doing is so uh labor-free in the first place hard to identify as work yeah that you barely have to do anything in the first place but just to say not everyone who works in tech is going to lead a lifestyle exactly like this where it's going to be as easy but this does not set a fantastic example um and i looked into this right because i went through i went through her tick tock and i've got a few videos to play but i did i i found some relevant information for that um she's in a business leadership marketing program at linkedin and um she is an intern would you like to guess how much she earns an hour i want to say 25 an hour actually 24 so very very close twenty four dollars an hour for that except she gets bonuses oh and comprehensive packages for this internship which bump up her annual salary a bit go on give give her annual salary a go you can guess i don't know sixty thousand dollars seventy god damn it seventy thousand dollars to do that to do what exactly what exactly do around here i will say being that she's in marketing this might be a stealth campaign to try and encourage people to move to chicago and start working at linkedin because honestly that seems like the easiest job imaginable yeah but at the same time the rest of her tick tock is filled with oh if you want to get into the sort of job that i've done you need to have this qualification you need to have done this degree you need to go have gone through all of these so it's not going to be and plus she says that her page is not affiliated with linkedin well yeah it's a private page yeah yeah it's it's a private page so it might be a stealth marketing campaign just to throw off that criticism first of all but at the same time this is absolutely how these people's days go and there's this this other one uh where her only work in this one is to supervise a film shoot behind the scenes which having done that sort of thing in the past means you sit there and every so often someone turns to you and goes is it is it looking all right and you go yeah it's looking fine to me and that's that's the work and then the rest of her day is spent going on a marketing dinner with people and i understand i understand that networking and forming business relationships is part of the whole is part of the daily grind for this but like you said it's hardly hard work and then there's this next one that i found where she's talking about the spirit of well-being where linkedin just gives everyone a day off each month for their mental well-being because apparently the job is so stressful and it's so difficult my mental wealthy i just feel so under so much pressure yeah i i don't actually think that like oh certain businesses that probably will be ridiculously stressful probably would be nice to give their employees a day off maybe randomly once a month just to let them relax and unwind a little bit this is not that job this is not the job that needs that this this is there's something about this that is i mean everything about her life is artificial right like it's all curated it's you know the glass and steel buildings the the the curated park that she goes around little ducks all of the the brands the fashion all the it just feels like the last days of empire right it really does it this these are the sort of the the perfect ones from the mouse utopia who are living just before the complete collapse that's all i'm seeing here oh no and i i do have some comments on that that i'll get to towards the end which i think will elaborate on it and sort of agree with you broadly there but the next one that i got up was this one where she's talking about this work trip to the linkedin headquarters and just play this clip up because this week i went to linkedin's headquarters in sunnyvale california this is my first ever work trip and i was here for an offsite with my team so i checked into my hotel and looked at the rooms they this hotel was so nice they even have dyson hair dryers and not gonna lie it almost slipped into my suitcase so after unpacking i got ready pretty fast for our first dinner this was the welcome event and we got to meet everyone on my team in person for the first time we all got a personalized goodie bag filled with swag like a teen sweatshirt and random fidget stuff to use throughout the meeting this week and this cute little mug and i posted about the hotel in my instagram story and when i came home i had the cutest handwritten note left for me and a little mini theragon which i used of course because my legs were so sore you just get you just get free stuff you already get paid a ridiculous amount with benefits so my legs were so yeah sure they were from all that sick yeah you know you think about legs i mean honestly and it's very strange to me that it was at this work meeting to the linkedin headquarters the first time that she's meeting all of her team members in person that just seems like a really weird disconnect to me that that's fine that that makes sense but i guess looking at these essentially these people like domestic pets domestic animals where they're just you know they've got everything they need provided to them right everything is just provided to them and they don't really do anything and they're sat there like as ornaments almost you know it's so weird what it reminds me of is american psycho because because legitimately one of the things that i found interesting watching that film most recently was that patrick does no work in the whole film all you ever see him do is sit when he's at work is sit around in his office listening to music doodling and apparently all these people do when they're at work is sit around in offices designed to make you feel nice and calm and eat free food and free snacks that are provided to you but just the way that everything is everything's it feels fake right like all of the people like they don't feel authentic and they don't feel like you know they've got like real human connections and things like this and everything is laid on for them instead of this very curated life yeah it's it's very clear to me that it's no wonder that a lot of these people because we we know that a lot of these big tech companies are where a lot of the social justice and progressivism is coming from and to me when i look at this it's no wonder when your life is so hollow and so empty and devoid of meaning all of these comforts are provided to you you know you didn't go and get these yourself no no someone has provided you with these comforts and so you're at the center of the like this network of things that are providing you with you know good things that you you are just a pet you are literally a pet so so to me i mean how would you survive outside of this environment i know and and how at the same time yeah john's branded them corporate economic parasites which no no the corporate economic pets they're not parasites they're pets yeah so so no wonder well sure that's linkedin's problem yeah but surely like i said it's no wonder these people get involved in progressive causes because a lot of progressivism you know if yeah if it goes back to marxism it's like well how are you going to claim that you're exploited i mean honestly how could you claim workers of the world what work have you done yeah so no wonder they latch themselves onto these um these virtue signaling movements because the likelihood is these people probably aren't planning on having kids at all either because they're all indulging in the progressive ideology so it's like well what am i going to have to leave an impact on the world i know my activist protests my activism even if they had kids what life lessons would they teach them well what hardship have they been exactly it's very strange because people when she was talking about the education that she went through to be able to get into a position like this a load of people in the comments were calling her out oh if you went to this university you must have had rich parents to be able to do that undoubtedly yeah so they've basically just replaced their rich parents with linkedin the corporation that's going to provide them with everything their parents use yeah and you're not even having to do the same level of work that you do if you're at home doing chores you know they've never done chores come on you you didn't grow up in a household with a they've never been asked to do the gardening they've never been asked to even empty the dishwasher yeah yeah and then uh the next they get prawn platters yeah the next clip is it's not the same life you and i have led harry no it certainly is not i'm from the north where it's grim up near the it never used to be there's a minimum wage right in the late 90s that wasn't a minimum wage and i had a job i was living in cornwall at the time working uh in like cleaning nightclubs and so i've cleaned toilets for like three pounds an hour before that must have felt dignified well i mean it was get on with you got just with it you got you made money and it really disappears you have any notions that women were like more clean than men oh it really does i mean i've worked in pubs and had to do similar things you know after the after the saturday night oh i guess it's time to clean up for sunday and you get given the you get given things to scrub the toilet with yeah but they would act like i've been oppressed or something they would consider this a form of you know oppression it's like well no it's just that they were the jobs that were going i mean i suppose comparatively maybe it was an oppression it was it wasn't suppression but like it just wasn't luxury yeah from their point of reference then yeah you must have been like the russian surface yeah that's how they'd look at it yeah yeah there's this one which goes to show if you play this clip it'll show that google is pretty much the exact same as well in the morning at google chicago office with me viviane and i are both women in tech so we toured each other's offices today it was a lazy friday morning so i ubered to west loop to google's office and it was a beautiful day out i got there finally here's my badge gotta flex and we immediately headed upstairs to the cafe i will say their food looked a lot better than our office the kompucha overflowed but i got some chai tea and we headed back down to sit down and take our meetings for the morning one thing google also has on us is their view it's beautiful so after a morning full of meetings we had our first mini lunch of the day i literally just grabbed some potatoes because you know a girl's gotta eat yum say hi to vivian eating her shepherd's pie we checked out the game room where you can even use the claw to grab free google swag pretty cool and there's an actual game like xbox room which is even cooler we don't have that at linkedin and i played some basketball and made my first shot hard life i know very difficult i've got to say when she goes through these run-downs of all of these various drinks and foods that she's eating in these places just completely foreign to me she might as well be speaking french because it's like never heard of that never heard of that all of that in those drawers trident gum that you can just pick up like that's just foreign to me it's such a privileged life yeah and uh but once once again it seems even at google that her friend who took her along to do this doesn't have much to do yeah it seems much the same like all of these jobs seem to be completely interchangeable with just varying degrees of luxury but i can't help but notice we're not hearing from the male engineers who underwrite the actual structure of the tech giants like we're not hearing from the code monkeys who presumably spend like you know 12 hours a day coding at their desks yeah i wonder if they're getting 70 grand a year yeah well they're probably getting more to be fair but like they're the ones who are actually doing the work yeah well that's the thing the level of pay to work ratio between them is going to be somewhat yeah absolutely suspect absolutely you know there's no way they're only doing twice as much work as these women to get twice that day and there was another clip where it's just very strange that i was going to play but i think i think i've made the point pretty clearly of what goes on in these things the only other thing that the next clip was going to display was the fact that for some reason apparently in linkedin you can just bring your friends oh into the office social club for no particular you don't need to play the clip john i think i've made it clear enough but as well as all this it shows it shows to me that these companies google linkedin all of these big tech giants have such an enormous level of bloat and inefficiency in their business model so i i expect it may not you know they probably wouldn't collapse entirely but if it weren't for massive support that these companies get from the state and subsidies and such they probably wouldn't be able to just employ people to sit around and do nothing or they might have to restructure it a little bit because the article that i got up for this uh next john if we go over just thank you it was just about how all these tech companies receive massive subsidies including uh tesla got 54 billion dollars um google's company parent company alphabet uh got 766 million dollars since 2000 and uh alphabet obviously owns google linkedin is owned by microsoft they don't have any details on microsoft but microsoft is so in bed with the government obviously they're going to be getting massive subsidies and as far as i'm aware this is basically corporate welfare so that the corporations can put over privileged upper middle class um uh brats uh on i don't know an extended form of welfare i don't even know if it's fair to congress because they're not doing anything wrong like you know they're not like the protesters oh yeah yeah but these are like just literally people who the the concept of freedom would actually be terrifying for them because it means they wouldn't be able to get their chai latte in the morning and their their orange water and the eucalyptus towel yeah if the government went smaller my big company might not get all this money from the government so they might not be able to give me all these freebies wherever i go like these people are literally domesticated it's it's i just find it incredible yeah like i say i'm not doing this to dunk on this particular woman she's only 22 years old so she obviously doesn't know any better and has never experienced any real hardship in her life she probably doesn't know the rest of the world isn't like this you know no but and again thank you to her for showing us what it's like to be a young woman working in tech yes they're so impressed i know very much he's really holding you down yeah but that's all i've got for that one but uh thank you very much for letting us know what it's like on the other side when you are able to burst through that glass ceiling presumably good luck if you appreciate that segment from the podcast the lotus eaters you can go to lotus eaters.com to get access to all the premium content we have
