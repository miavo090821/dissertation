But to put social media rep on par with an actual marketing team would be to put the ingredient delivery guy at a restaurant on par with the head chef when it comes to the weekly operations of a kitchen.\n\nThe video shows it all. Her \"work day\" started at 7 am, arrived at work a bit before 9 am, and when her work day was \"finally over\" the sun was still high up in the sky. So let's say 5 pm as in summer in chicago it becomes twilight around 8:30 pm.\n\nIn the video, the only work she did was some browsing, an \"all hands\" whatever that is which a lot of people wouldn't even consider work, doing some certification thing, and \"finishing up work\" at the end of the day.\n\nThat's basically a 9 to 5 job, where she did maybe 2~3 hours of actual work. The rest was spent on breakfast, lunch, watching others play ping pong, \"unplugging\" in the \"quiet room\", and relaxing. And all of it in an office filled with decadence and luxury.\n\nActually, I take my first statement back. Her \"job\" isn't comparable to a delivery guy. That would be an insult to the delivery guy as he actually WORKS and delivers to multiple places. Her \"job\" really is basically just adult daycare. Adult daycare she gets paid to go to no less!\n\nI work as a cook, and I do more work in 1 hour than she does during her entire work day, yet probably get paid a FRACTION of what she gets.",

        "text": "@trishfitzpatrick2066 Thanks for the feedback, truly. \n\nI think it’s an almost impossible moral pinch-point: on the one hand we have defective narcissists, but on the other hand they were literally engineered that way. And most of the people who break free of the Matrix seem to have either had extremely loving parents, if not received discipline and had a work-ethic instilled into them by alternative means. Call it wimpy if you will, but terminating a bunch of people for having been born into a bad start seems almost callously evil. But then we have the situation we have, and only limited time with which to solve serious problems and promote radical change. Ergo, the reasonable compromise would seem to be to force these people out of positions which they do not deserve, are not entitled to, and haven’t the means to retain, let alone effectively make use of. Obviously they’ll kick and moan, but that’s irrelevant. They will literally be better off for it, as will their progeny. \n\nCommunity-building is therefore a good idea on the local level— getting people working together and for themselves, while developing real, non-Matrix life skills so they’re capable of fending for themselves. I think that will work because ultimately the pushback against the machine’s collapse is just an expression of impotence. But if you empower them, they’ll *choose* to do it, because the trialling process of developing that empowerment will *show* them how liberating and rewarding it is. \n\nIn the end, everyone *can* win. It will be ridiculously hard, but it can be done (I’m sure of it). \n\nBetter get mapping out strategies and grafting on my end— cashing my cheque where my mouth is haha. \n\nAgain, thanks for the feedback. Appreciated. 🙂",

I've seen men and women complain about the gender pay gap. My point with the pay gap is that when people talk about it they only mention wages. No mention of the type of job, position, work hours, days worked vs days off, how much time is spent working overtime, how much time is spent on vacation, etc. All of these affect how much someone is paid.\n Men and women are different. We graviated towards different fields that align with our interests. Generally, women prefer fields such as social work, teaching, nursing and men generally prefer fields such as construction, plumbing, stem. There are outliers, of course, but if you were to look at the income of some of the jobs listed, the ones men typically work in pay more. It's not because employers have some agenda to pay women less than men, they don't. It's just that we happen to prefer work that doesn't have the same pay as others. Don't know how that was seen as misogynistic?",

It was the same when I was at Uni, most people half assed all their work, barely showed up, scraped by with 3rd class degs and still ended up employed for decent positions. As a SW engineer, I am very passionate about my work and think technology (if used correctly and usefully) can be a great thing. But as of late, I am reconsidering my career choice. I can barely get any work done in relative peace, always in pointless meetings, having to fix other issues cause by the above. If you are a developer worth their salt, you will be relied upon all the time to fix others mistakes or lack of effort, care and attention. My last boss had a hard on for hiring ( x demographic / sex of coder ) because ( DIOS or * insert buzz phase here *) and 9/10 times they end up being absolutely useless and they fired them pretty quick, never seemed to occur to them to hire based on actual expertise. IMO not everybody should code or be a developer, the same as not everyone should be an artist, make music etc. Do what you actually enjoy or excel at, don't do it because you are trying to stick it to the man.",

Schools are worthless coward facilities that train the next generation of obedient parasites who will then become useless whiners in corporate offices. Schools are making these social problems worse, not better. This problem could be solved if people taught teenagers to share the labor of adults and earn their own shit. School teachers and worthless parents obviously aren't helping either. Raise your kids better, discipline them financially and morally; I also advocate homeschooling them, because if you let the state do everything for you because your lazy, your son or daughter can turn into that pathetic specimen. Schoolteachers, principles, bad parents and University professors should be put on trial, shamed, humiliated and locked up in prison for making people so weak, bitchy and cowardly, until they learn their lesson.

        "text": "@pressb its hard for me to remember my parents doing something for me, and not having to work on the farm. I was operating farm equipment at 8 years old, that was in 1977. I worked my ass off to buy my first car at 13, and everything after that with my parents taking most of what I earned, I got the scraps of my labor. I left the farm at 17. Enlisted at 19 after finding the job market to be absolute crap, even for someone who was a competent machinist and mechanic.\n\nI turned 21 in June of 1990, while I was home on leave. Got back to my base, and I remember vividly waking up to AFN (armed forces network) saying Iraq has invaded Kuwait and congress is considering sending in Marines and Airborne divisions. By the 10th of August, I was working 12 to 14 hour nights, with no days off, waking up just as tired as when I fell asleep in my uniform. My job was all about airlift, and that war was almost entirely airlifted. \n\nI packed on so much muscle from the heavy lifting of that job, that my weight went from 210, to 190, back up to 230lbs and I was absolutely ripped. Any idea how hard it is to do laundry when you have no days off, work 14 hour days, and you still need to sleep? Nobody did it for us. Finding food meant taking MRE's off airplanes I worked, there was no time in my day to go get food, I was on the flight line for the entire 12 to 14 hours. If I didn't grab an MRE here and there I did not eat. I warmed them on the intake manifold of the vehicles I was operating so I didn't have to eat cold MREs.\n\nAt 34 my second war started, this time for the profit of politicians. Turns out you can't work like you did at 21 when you are 34. You're no longer indestructible. Joints on me started wearing out in 2003, knees, shoulders, elbows, hips.. been trashed and living with chronic pain ever since. Also got divorced in 2001,so I was having 71% of my gross pay taken from me and given to her. I was graciously allowed $100 a month to live on by my home state, so I got to eat once a day and slept in my car or on friend's couches.\n\nIn 2013 I got divorced again, and decided to buy some land so I could build a home for me, and a shop to rebuild old cars, which is what I do to stay busy. Nobody showed up to help for most of it, in 2015 I hired two guys to help me do 90% of the roof on the shop. I did everything else, cleared trees, prepped the foundation, poured the concrete, built the walls, wired it... Crippled 45 year old builds home/shop.\n\nI've been rebuilding and repairing my vehicles since that first one in 1982, it is VERY rare anyone else does something to them. Mostly I have a shop check my alignments, everything else I do. I did the front brakes on my beater 2000 Silverado 4x4 last night, so simple to do and I used to make $500 doing it for other people.\n\nI look down on people who cannot do things for themselves, and have to pay others to do it for them. I see them as inept, incapable, and lacking knowledge as well as skills. If I ever get so old I can't do things for myself, I am gonna check out on my terms. I doubt I will make it that far though, its not like I haven't been exposed to some really nasty stuff over the years.. chem weapons in the first war, burn pits in the second one, farm chemicals for the first 17 years of my life, all the stuff with cars and machines... I'm amazed I am still alive at 53 to be honest.\n\nI've never had the luxury of wondering if I am spoiled, I have always been the man people come to for help, they do not come to help me. If I don't do it, it doesn't get done. Nothing is provided for me like the chick in this video... nothing. I go to the VA for health care and they compensate me for breaking me in my two wars, but I earned the hell out of it. We might be even if I live to 110.",

        "text": "​@MugMan 1. Back then, as today for men only in many nations still, the vote comes with the obligation to enlist in times of war. Women simply *chose* not to vote, because they believed that they would have to enlist for the voting \"rights\", too. There's plenty of witness testimony covering that inconvenient fact in various non-feminist history books, from women themselves, to substantiate that claim. \n\n1.a. Additionally, the upper class women that initially made up the Suffragette movement, never intended for the working class women to have voting rights. They only wanted it for themselves, to create a conservative majority vote in the governments of the West, that would have kept the working class as a whole in perpetual, indentured servitude forever. That's why most men objected to the female vote, initially. As far as women not having any political influence, that's another feminist lie too, because you can find female senators in the midwest as early as the mid-18th century, 50-60 years before men as a group got the vote. \n\n1.b. As far as men not feeling \"masculine\" for taking care of their own kids, let me just remind you that there's NO RECORDED HISTORY of indigenous tribes letting their women raise the male children. \nFact is, that before Queen Victoria came along and decreed a set of rules for women's behavior, both socially and in the homes, women taking care of their sons after they turned 6-7 years old was completely unheard of. \nThat has *always* been a man's job, all the way through human history, because a woman can't fucking teach a boy how to become a man. She can only teach him what *women* expect from him, and any selfrespect and backbone goes right out the window with that role as a servant to others. Yeah, I'm looking at you, and your own projections of what constitutes masculinity, bud.\n\n1.c. The wage gap is BS, it has been debunked a million times over, and I can't fucking believe I have to do it again: It is entirely based on women's own choices in jobs. It makes sense that you're not paid the same as a hairdresser or nurse, as you're being paid as a crab fisherman in the Bering Sea, or as working on an oil rig or in the mines, right? I already told you that men uphold 98% of the dangerous and dirty jobs that kills, because women CHOOSE not to. If anything, there's a major gap in women's understanding of what constitutes equality, particularly in that area, because while women have been granted a whole variety of Choises, men are still stuck with the exact same expectations, obligations, responsibilities, and demands of accountability that they were 400 years ago.\n\n2. Don't act like work is a badge to wear, when it factually is a slave labour to the vast majority of the men that keeps society's wheels spinning, in the maintenance and ressource creating jobs. Only women are so gullible and easily swayed, that it has been possible for the same elite that has financed feminism from day one, to sell them the lie that becoming a wage slave is somehow \"liberating\", when it is not. \n\n3. I'm just, as are others in this thread and for blatantly obvious reasons, making the observation that she's not really doing anything that she couldn't have been doing at home, while taking care of the kids, instead of paying other women to do it. She would certainly have just as much time socialising with other women in her position, when she's not meditating in her safe space quiet room, while her children are taking a nap.\n\n4. Try not to work so hard for women's acceptance and praise that it becomes pathetic, you're not a little poodle waiting to be padded on the head, and they are not your masters. \nAlso, you would vastly improve the case you're trying to make, if you actually did your historical research and homework, instead of buying into the feminist's general  horseshit and victimhood narrative. Because one of the first thing to stand out very, very clearly, is how immensely hard life was for *everyone* in the past, how utterly physically unequipped women were to survive in that reality, and how many of the aspects, that you and the other feminists now refer to as misogyni, were rational, logical, and necessary choices women themselves had to make in order to survive.\n\nYou know, before the State became their new husband by way of women's own voting support, and used that power to first destroy the family unit, making single motherhood upbringings the norm, before now turning their kids into freaks with no future, no thanks to the vast majority of *female teachers* in our daycare learning institutions.\nSee, there's another bunch of female *choices* for you, and as non-sensical as most of them, because they're entirely motivated by an insatiable craving for instant gratification...just like with kids.",

It's like you never heard of discrimination based on gender and why that affects women to get jobs lead by men and how that impacts women either. If you think a woman can't raise a child, especially a boy, you're clearly too far gone. Women are stronger than ever and clearly with more acceptance around LGBTQ, more people are speaking up about the discrimination by men. From SA and harrassment to wage gap and treated poorly, it's quite clear there is still male dominance in America and a lot needs to change. Women clearly speak out each day about rape and SA in a work place, guess who assaulted them? Take a look at how many women in comparison to men are assaulted by the opposite sex. It's interesting what you learn when you have an open mind and don't think that it's a man's job to raise a boy. We should be learning from history, not respecting it. It's crazy to me to think there are people who blame another gender, especially in this case when clearly she is marketing on tiktok about her internship. She didn't raise any inequality issues but a bunch of men hiding behind keyboards get offended and think they are oppressed, lol. But look how America is going backwards and taking women's rights to abortion, not surprised it's full of men who think they know what's right for women. You literally get thrown a worse sentence for abortion than for raping in America.\n\nAnyways, if you have a daughter or wife, go tell them what you think their rights are, I am sure they will love to hear what you think is right for them 💯👌",

The problem I have is people saying \"she is the problem\".\n\nShe says she is an intern so she clearly is learning the ropes and moves from different companies and deals with marketing, so her days probably aren't like this that often but maybe they are, we simply don't know. For all we know this is a marketing campaign to get more people hired to linkden. \n\nOverall, some big male ceo probably has hired many people to do the same job she does but also doesn't do more than anyone in the office, so for the fact that she has a job and is getting paid well is at least a nice thought, even though the lower class could use some extra money in their pocket. Not her fault, blame the billionaires and start taxing them more and less on the poor.",

        "text": "@MugMan It's like you never heard that women took over the jobs in the industries during WWII, because there were no one else to do the jobs, so they had to. And yet only 2% of them are in those same jobs today, and the majority of those are in the admininstrations. What is that, if not a choice then?\n\n\nAll the stats realting to single mother upbringings quite clearly shows, that a significant percentage of boys raised by women turn out to lose all ambitions, shows up in the crime stats or ennd up in jail, or simply lose themselves in the gaming world or porn sites, because they lack simple basic drive and motivation. \nLook at the Antifa, etc, that are burning down cities today. Most of those young men come from broken homes, that's a statistical fact, according to research from several different Western nations. \n\nAdding to that, there is the fact that somewhere in the 90+ percentages of all male serial killers are raised by single mothers. And there's a very obvious reason they are turning on women. \nThose are not very healthy symptomps or stats, in terms of the ability to raise boys, whether you think I'm too far gone or not.\n\nAnd personally, I don't really give a shit what you think. Brett. You're so far down the bottle of feminist cool-aid, that you're not even aware of FBI's counter research of the rape claims, clearly stating the more than 50%, -the numbers might even be as high as some 70%, -are based on a need for attention, revenge for him not calling back, or simply made up from being caught fucking someone else than their legitimate partner. \nThat is of course excluding the demographics that women suicidally supported the import of, with millions of 'welcome, migrant'-signs, completely oblivious to the wider societal and cultural consequences, that all of us now have to deal with, not just women. \n\nDon't take my word for it, I must insist that you go look all of it up yourself.\n\nSo, considering your obvious lack of basic critical thinking skills, and the fact that women lie A LOT as established by the FBI, none of it gives me any reason to believe that you're capable of understanding the basic 24//7 arithmetic of raising a healthy, fully functional, and sane child paired with a 9-to-5 hour job. What the fuck is the point in having a child, if you can't wait to unload the responsibility for it on others, so you can go pursue your pretend career, Brett?\n \nHave I nice day, I'm done here. To be quite honest, you are boring me to death with your lack of selfreflection, because you're exactly the kind of male I'm talking about, if your own site here on Youtube is any indication. \nSonic and Gorn Porn, Brett. \nReally? \nHow old are you? Late teens, early 2ooes, correct?\n\n-Which is likely why you feel the need to defend your lack of experience with women so passionately, of course. You're probably also using tiny heart emojis in some of your online replies, as evidence of how successfully women have managed to domesticate you. \nSuch a good, good boy there, Brett..\nCome back and talk to me in 30 years, when you have some real life experience in your backpack.",

Now we have millions of elderly people who spent precious thousands of dollars in insurance, mostly because in many places you are legally required to buy insurance. I understand that, at the time, it was a win/win for politicians and \"entrepreneurs\", since this industry creates a lot of jobs, some being really well paid.",

Energy sector is great example in US. We allow boom and bust cycles in price of energy. I advocate for energy price stabalization, where we set base price for energy such as say $50-60 a barrel of oil that government will buy for x amount of units as agreed to if no other buyer is found. That would allow for stability in exploration drilling and combined with government backed loans or underwriting for capital expenditures could create a more reliable energy sector. Energy costs should be regulated within margins for US domestic strategy. Right now free market enetgy sucks and is causing these dramtic cost increases. As far as I am concerned if a country cant maintain cost controls for energy and inflation it is a failed country/government.",

I'm mostly just numb, apart from when the adrenaline kicks in, then I get a little high off it, even though I'm having part of my life dismantled before my eyes. \n\nThat sounds bad, but you're right, we become used to whatever our existence is and set that be our zero.  My existence would be intolerable to all but a few people I know, yet I am mostly not concerned by it. I'm not all \"poor me\" the only reason I know what's happened to me is bad is because other people find it bad. For me it's a nothing. Physical suffering is harder to get used to, psychological suffering is solved by eating something good, drinking, watching something interesting or going to sleep.",

So yes, if you have a woman like this who have clearly lived a very posh life, your definition of hardship might be having to stay late at work because that's literally one of the worst things that have happened to you in recent memory. Meanwhile a person who's in debt, working backbreaking work 12 hours a day, having to deal with rising gas prices and food shortages WISHES his only problem would be having to stay late at work sometimes, that would actually be happiness in his eyes not hardship.

        "text": "@CCovers1 You have to remember that the Greatest Generation (born 1901/1902 to roughly 1925 - 1927) was also molded by the Roaring Twenties (1920s). Crime was rampant. Many innocent people died. Chicago was the place for the Chicago Outfit (that still exists) and the likes of Al Capone. 1929 marked a horrific year for crime and the economy. The stock market crash in October of 1929 would lead into the Great Depression, which engulfed all of the 1930s. \n\nEven in entertainment media like Hollywood, you can tell that this generation did their utmost best to fight for the greater good. World War 2, without the contributions of the Greatest Generation, would of turned out completely different. \n\nIt’s why I think entertainers like Jimmy Stewart, Henry Fonda and Orson Welles are far superior to the likes of what Hollywood is doing now. The Millennial and Zoomer generation is full of beta males. Just like what went on with the MeToo movement, these young women are having their way while the men are getting chastised. \n\nThis young 22 year woman has done nothing. And yet she holds more social capital and influence than a majority of men. This entire system is weak, and we’re very much heading towards a complete economic collapse. \n\nPerhaps the Zoomers may turn out strong later in life. Right now, I don’t see that happening any time soon.",

Senior engineers, myself included, were required for a meeting at 1400 most days, while one day that didn't have that meeting had a whole team meeting for 2 hours, usually cram a bit of work in about 1500, have to catch various stakeholders before 1600 as none of them stayed after that, cram in 30 minutes of work and then rush to get my train. Some days I couldn't even get into the office being the first to arrive and not being a key holder.

Like you said, a select team of creative and hardworking people is the best thing for marketing. The problem is that as the organization grows, it becomes less and less efficient and the temptation by management is to put more resources into marketing i.e. hiring more people which  just makes the team slower than they were before. The way that a marketer moves up in their career is by \"building a team\" and hiring people underneath them, so there is an incentive to hire more people even if you don't need them. You could be the most brilliant media buyer or graphic designer in the world, but if you want your company to pay you more, you better hire people underneath you to do the work that you used to do, only worse, because managers and creative directors make the big bucks.",

I think many times it ends up stifling creativity and collaboration rather than incentivising it. \n\nFor example, one big reason 3d printing was able to take off in the maker space a few years ago was because several big patents expired, how much sooner could it have become widespread and been further developed if patents weren't an issue? Was the patent holder doing as much to develop the tech and benefit people as the entire community could?\n\nAlso, for decades the big car and oil companies have been buying small, innovative electric car companies and then shutting them down to stifle any competition. Not developing it or releasing it to market to benefit humanity, just killing it so they wouldn't have any disruptive competition. And because those big car/oil companies now owned the electric car company's patents, no one else could release that tech to market either. The only reason electric cars are taking off now is cuz Musk refused to sell Tesla to them early on, and ended up forcing the car companies to release their own electric cars to stay relevant and/or reduce Tesla's market share and capital.\n\nAnd I could go on, there's tons of other examples of these systems being abused too, so much so that it makes me think that having these patent and copyright laws does more harm to society than good. Maybe there's a better way to do it, but I dunno what it'd be.",

There are too many people on benefits because they choose not working for a little less and staying at home. Yes, that makes a lot of people even lazier and miserable, but knowing what's good for oneself isn't very common as it turns out. So we rely on immigrants who are willing to work for less to fulfill the actual material needs of our countries, which is something we have in common with the US.\n\nPS, I don't mean to be a dick but please use punctuation bro",

It was officially owned by a woman (who had inherited it from her father) so it was a \"minority contractor\" that got preference in bids so long as a majority of the workers were minorities.\n\nSo a little over half our workers were minorities. About half were one particular minority, of whom about a dozen actually worked. The rest mostly stood around, though occasionally they picked up a tool and messed something up. I'd work nights and on one job for a couple weeks we had three and a half people (because I would finish up my regular shift and then go and help out this other crew) and at least for those two weeks about 95% of that job was done by us and the other 5% by the 20+ guys working day shift.\n\nFrom some things I heard it seems that our minority employees were paid more than those of us doing the work.\n\nThat company, to its credit, had some great engineers and some very competent field workers - and eventually they gave up their minority contractor status and stopped competing for those set aside jobs. Of course that necessitated a big layoff, after which the dozen minority workers that everyone knew were willing and able to work were brought back ... and the rest were not.

There was a time in America known as the frontier/wild west whereby immigrants from around the world were capable of settling into camps & towns and were allowed to set up their shops immediately upon arrival. Everyone worked for themselves back then. But this would come to an end when gold, oil and steam barons (and bankers) became too powerful and started purchasing and exploiting tons of land. In the early 1900s you could still easily set up shop which is what a lot of Itallian and Chinese immigrants did but after the great depression, things started slowing down and production went straight to the Chinese. Now all of the bankers and oil barons have loads of money and kept people down.\n\nToday, this has reached an extreme level and now people have lost a sense of identity because they are not working for themself (and have no religion). Many Mexican immigrants in the US work their asses off and do have some independent businesses but the way businesses are treated is bullshit. Megacorporations on the other hand can get away with anything and don't pay their taxes.\n\nThe west was once a great place for freedom but now it has become a joke because of massive corporations who have too much power and money. It is a massive shame.",

Oh and her blog as well got her the job.  She seems to be more like a production assistant or runner rather than a producer which is where most people in television start off.  It's just a fancy title.  Anything bad happens to her or her housemates and she breaks out the bubbly to drown her sorrows or to get her housemates to do the same.  Anything good happens to her or a housemate and she breaks out the bubbly to celebrate.  She's even drinking alcohol on the train back from Bristol.  \n\nThe main characters are exceedingly boring apart from her closest friend Birdy who uses her first boyfriend to escape from all that and do more interesting things such as going camping.  The housemate who is a school teacher at least has some political ideals but the main character is determined to squash those.  Birdy announces she's moving out in the final episode to move in with her boyfriend.  Probably to escape the main character who she's grown out of and is rather suffocating.",

The work was actually on one of the most beautiful code bases I'd ever seen on an enterprise project. Honestly, the best people there were the oldbies -- folks in their 50s and 60s who'd been around the industry a while and got acquihired. Google had figured out a good formula for getting the benefits of their skills and knowledge while mollycoddling the Nooglers. Of course, as the James Damore case discovery showed, mollycoddling has its downsides too, as there are people inside Google who identify as anime characters or plushies of anime characters (or both simultaneously) and will probably scream that their rights are being violated if they are not acknowledged as such.",

    "text": "The literary connection to the \"Pleasure Island\" scene from Pinocchio is alarming; all the youths are lured to an oasis of indulgence and never want to leave. While it can be argued that her compensation seems a lot (whether for her age or for the nonexistent work she's engaged in) it's certainly not that much in Chicago or NYC where money doesn't go far. You're already scraping by on six figures in these cities and can barely afford to save anything if you actually live in these areas where everything is overpriced. And that was before inflation. But most of these types don't mind living in tiny apartments so long as they look trendy and have an ever-increasing list of communal amenities.\n\nThis sort of collectivist zeitgeist is the same with these companies and their various work perks. Personal remuneration isn't prioritized, they sell people on shared experiences, amenities and privileges. Just as it's cheaper for companies to encourage/promote/reimburse abortions over maternity leave in order to retain their workforce, it's also cheaper for them to compensate the youths with catered food, luxury trinkets, on-site services, looser schedules, less work, etc. rather than compensating them with money. Because doing that would allow them enough agency to structure their own lives.\n\nYou can't pay rent with complimentary beverages and scented towels, but they're effective tools of indoctrination to make people feel valued. In reality, these companies can lower their overhead by providing perks and benefits (ranging from potato chips to private quiet rooms) rather than increasing their salaries. Tech companies build their campuses to be one part office, one part mixed commercial entity, and one part theme park, because they don't want employees to have a reason to go home.\n\nThis is a modernized system of passive debt bondage, not much different from the old system where laborers owed their soul to the company store, except here the employees are willfully engaged in it because the company store basically operates free of charge. The youths don't even know they're in a closed ecosystem where their personal agency, purchasing power, and ability to make a life for themselves independent from the company (or the state) is being eroded away ever so slowly. They're too wrapped up in a pampered utopia to even notice.",

Amazon was nothing like this - they have massive inefficiencies and tons of internal competition so everyone has to work incredibly hard because stuff is just stitched together poorly internally. you also don't get any freebies aside from.. powdered apple cider 🤮 but if there's an email chain called \"Vultures\" where you can have the pickings of food left over from bigger meetings\n\nfacebook though... jeez. it was worse than this video. and by worse I mean.. better? the san francisco campus has a GIANT courtyard.. actually it's more like a tiny town with free ice cream/sweet shop, BBQ restaurant, salad restaurant, indian food, and a few others to boot. you could get as many free headphones/keyboards/ other tech goodies out of vending machines. you didn't do any work, it was all about who you knew and sucking up because they had so much money that every individual did basically nothing besides eat food and drink coffee, wander around the beautiful campus.\n\nI do miss it though. it's just not work\n\noh and the point about \"it's no wonder these places are a hot bed for social justice warriors because your life is so hollow and all your comforts provided to you\" that you have nothing else to do. so true. Ironically, facebook was the only time I experienced true sexism (by another woman in senior management), where I was essentially fired for being \"too direct in emails\" (actual quote), but told to train others to reach my level of proficiency (because I actually tried and gave a shit about my job, fuck me right!) before letting me go. it's all about saying the right things publicly and then screwing over people privately/having no regard for them because your own image matters more than anything else.",

I think the first correlates to the former though— the extreme decadence being a symptom of deprivation, or vice versa, or *both* being connected to some other root cause?\n\nBoth are problems that need solving though. Implementing more responsible frameworks for investors to abide, constraining the breadth of their investment across useless start-up projects, maybe? It might reduce the number of these overpaid, bonus-laden nonsense roles which exist. Taxing the companies for failed start-ups? Continuing to shame this extravagant decadence and offering small subsidies to those projects which forward productive and useful ideas and results? We still have the problem of defining ‘productive’ and ‘useful’, since who’s to determine that and how do we know their definitions are better than ours, but it might encourage investment to be more focussed and *invested*, and less passive or ‘laissez-faire’. Can we find extra-occupational projects for these young high-flyers to engage in which stimulates their creativity/productivity at work while “bearing it true” according to the needs of the city, nation, and world?\n\nI don’t know what to do about underemployment or stagnant wages I’m afraid, since at least the latter seems to be almost insoluble: a symptom of oversaturated markets with enormous companies competing for limited resources, straining the amount of “value added” by its employees, per unit of employment, and thereby reducing the amount of money they can be compensated for their wage-labour. I hate to sound conservative but it might very well be a case of find more meaningful work in a higher paying, less saturated market; hunker down, be diligent and aim for promotion; or, simply suck it up and do nothing, because there isn’t really anything that *can* be done *for* someone in that position.",

Or are they the symptom of psychological schizophrenia expressing at the periphery of social organisation after its limited cultural (sexual) energy has burned up, for want of its more appropriate and natural outlet— sex? And might this indicate that just as we live “in the shadow of Freud”, that so too did our ancestors, as in they relied *only* on their sexual energy to motivate them culturally, when in fact a *human* is much more than their procreative instinct, impulse, urge? \n\nPerhaps then this cyclic pattern is as much an expression of defective, maybe *partial* (or ‘fractal’) psychology, as it is some necessary rule that sexual energy alone might fuel our projects, only to be inevitably inappropriately channeled by some civilisation’s later-stage citizens until hedonism prevails and society collapses? \n\nPerhaps the tension between primal instinct and generative creativity was a tension born of a false dichotomy, but one conveniently designed to manufacture a condition of constant revolution by design? So, who then might have designed that tension and why? Who stands to gain from this? And how might we resolve this tension if it in fact exists, and is in fact a problem?",

And I would say that the only purpose the sex drive have, would be to sire offspring that the rest of your lifetime would be turning around to nurture and protect. But sex drive does affect behaviour too, which we are still getting a better understanding of. \n\nI find the complexity of the human nature and behaviours hard to understand, am I doing this because unlike it or am I doing it because my instincts tells me this is what is needed to fulfil one of the purposes of being a human?\n\nAt the same time I think the only purpose for humans are what they decide their purpose are, that it is not decided in advance, which makes it all more vexing. \n\nUntil puberty, boys and girls doesnt really have the same outlook on sex as the concept arent important for their current state, thus they havent had the biological/psychological triggers set in yet, but then the hormones start to surge in uncontrollable amounts and we see the new behaviours appear. But over time for most it diminishes again after a few decades. Thus showing at least the period of time where the individual must act to secure the future of their own purpose or forfeit it. \n\nBut still the purpose of sex and the sexdrive would seem to both be the continuation of Genes and spreading them. On the other hand it is not easy thus we strive to perform to attract a mate to do the business with. But over time there happens a shift, either you get offspring and most nurture them for the future both theirs and your own, but some individuals finds purpose in creating things instead, which usually would be done to (by nature) to attract a mate, building a dwelling, hunting or making useful tools or pleasant artworks, but instead because they get the same feeling of contentment and pleasure from those tasks or obtaining those skills for them selves, which maybe are more directed by logos than pathos.

Now I'm more of the former and I've come to see that religion is just a tool that gets used by authoritarians. For some religion and faith can be  wonderful things and do amazing things for people and I wish them all the best.",

        "text": "@chad_bro_chill Definitely! This is pretty much how I feel. A lot of \"skeptics\" claim to be, but are what I jokingly refer to as SINOs! (Skeptics In Name Only ;) ) A true skeptic applies that to everything, questions the validity of any assertion made by someone else, whether they be speaking from a position of authority or not.\n\nI'm not necessarily full-blown agnostic atheist, but definitely at the very least agnostic theist. I don't think life, the universe, and everything just sprung up on its own, but it's impossible to know with our current knowledge and technology, whether that was a being of higher power or not. At the same time what we may see as a godly being just may be something we aren't able to fully comprehend... That aside, I honestly love religion and hearing/learning about it. I find it so fascinating that humans came up with ways to explain what they didn't understand and codify morals in such a way as to pass them on to future generations via cautionary tales and such. Obviously there's a lot of fantastical spins to things, but the core morals stand the test of time.",

Everyone has open positions, a massively overworked crew and too much work ahead. Trying to hire senior engineers is crazy, and salaries have grown quite a bit. I get hit with offers daily, and I have my profile set to \"I'm not looking for new positions\".\n\n> Also what does the \"teach people to code\" bubble even mean?\n\nBig Tech has convinced all kinds of governments (states, cities, even small towns) that there's lots of people wanting to code but they just don't have the knowledge. These governments pay subsidies and set up \"programming\" courses that churn out crappy web developers. \n\nThis has become very profitable for the course givers (because free money) and for big tech (because making the worker pool look larger tends to depress wages), while screwing the \"students\" (who end up doing things they didn't sign for) and the tax payer (because those courses were worthless anyway).",

I've worked in the tech industry for about 6 years now and it only took me a year to realize something was terribly wrong. I've worked on several different creative teams doing video production and animation, and the nature of the job means I'm actually doing real work, but only for half the day most of the time (sometimes more, sometimes less). The amount of pointless meetings and committees is mind blowing to me. Everyday feels incredibly pointless. It truly feels like 99% of the people at any given tech company are just working for the sake of working and seeming busy. I can't tell you how many last minute \"emergency\" requests I've gotten over the years requiring me to work super late or over the weekend for no apparent reason. Or mindless feedback I've gotten from 10 individuals who have no business giving feedback, but feel they must do so to show their worth. I could go on for ages. I remember one time we had a company meeting where this motivational speaker came to speak to us all. He was an Air-force pilot and in an attempt to motivate people to push themselves he introduced us to his catchphrase \"Push it up\". He has repeat over and over again \"Push it up\" while pumping our fists in the air. I felt like I was in a cult. It was actually kind of a scary moment. It really is apocalyptic. I'm paid well and now work from home which Is why I have no desire to leave. That leaves me time and money to focus on stuff I actually think matters.",

Queen Catherine the Great of Russia, formerly a German princess, invited Germans to set up farming colonies along the Volga River. Many didn't even learn the Russian language. Russia needed to modernize and better food production was key. For a few hundred years they had a good thing going with some form of property rights. Then, as it was written in my family history, the Bolsheviks asked the Volga River Germans if they wanted to continue their way of life or work on a commune. They of course wanted to continue their way of life and were forced relocated to Siberia because they chose the wrong answer. The Bolsheviks only allowed them to take what they could carry. In a harsh environment, with little material wealth like manufacturing and harvesting tools, there were starvation and weather related deaths. And ironically, Russians starved soon after. Some Volga River Germans were able to escape to their great-great grandparents' homeland of Germany. Those with foresight about the bad times to come on continental Europe migrated mainly to the the plains of the United States where many set up farms. And government welfare wasn't a thing back then.",

        "text": "That's how white collar work goes. I'm an IT Director with 20 years working in offices in many industries. There are days you feel kind of bad for not getting anything done, but they are offset by the days when there isn't enough of you to go around and the pressure is stacked high to fix something or meet a deadline. It balances out. When I was younger I worked on a factory floor and the pressures there are different. That job was about being on time, to the minute, because if you were late that meant the poor guy or girl who was operating your machine for the last 8 hours needs to keep working. Quickly learned how valuable it was to be on time. I worked hard, physically, at that job and left at the end of the night feeling pretty good about the work I put in. I NEVER left that factory job feeling like I didn't put in enough effort. But that's how it goes. That's one of the divides between blue collar and white collar work. In white collar work you need to make your own decisions and keep yourself busy sometimes. People notice it over time, even if they don't notice it day to day or even if they don't confront you about it. Time will tell. If the ladies in this video don't do actual work, they won't advance further than nepotism will allow. For most people, nepotism doesn't carry far.\n\nFor anyone who reads this the important thing is to find work you enjoy doing. Sometimes you have to stick it out at a shitty job for a while. Keep going. Pad that resume and every couple years, put yourself out there and get a job offer. Interviewing for jobs is like dating, the correct way to look at it is as a numbers game. Apply often, even if only a small percentage of applications result in interviews. Disregard rejection. Keep trying, stay until you've run the salary/position ladder as far as you can go, then find another job. Ask for more money than you think you deserve. Take what you want an increase it by 5k or 10k, and ask for the bigger number. It's the best way to improve your salary and position. Find a job you enjoy working with people you think are cool.",

The whole thing was a facade for virtue and the business itself was crumbling behind the scenes. It wasn't like that at the start but the speed at which this mindset became dominant was staggering.",

And this was nowhere near the hardest day I've ever had, nor the most dangerous (climbing trees with a chainsaw comes to mind), nor the longest, nor the most physically exhausting.\nAfter work, I clogged up my shower drain, ate some leftover chicken, and went to bed, because 10 hours of back-breaking manual labor in your 30s will tend to do that to you.\nI invite this woman to spend 30 minutes on the job with us some time.

These youngsters who are only kids and whom probably take anti-depressants, or the venture capitalists who fund them? And what does that say about those capitalists? If that’s how wisely they spend their hard-earned capital, perhaps they can’t be trusted to wield that kind of power after all? Back to sustaining a critique against modern Capitalism. It’s not looking good for 21st c. “meritocracy” I’m afraid.\n\nThanks for the answer— that was helpful.",

It's the work environment fostered by management.\nMy own office (at least the call centre department), had been backsliding over the last 15 years.\n\nIt started with wearing \"proper business attire\", and you were sent home if you didn't have a buttoned shirt.\nWith each management change it degraded. It changed to casual wear anytime. Then motivation changed from \"get a dollar a call\" to \"win moves for the communal Risk game\" to \"popcorn machine and nerf gun games during breaks\"... to \"here's the quiet room\" (which makes more sense in context of an open floor with hundreds of people talking to customers, but still)... to \"here's the sandbox and coloring books\". I am NOT being hyperbolic, this was literally what happened.\n\nThe fact that the job incited people to want to weep in a quiet room to destress from being screamed at, or degrade to infant behavior to escape that stress, should be quite telling of the kind of job it was becoming.\n\nThis all comes from management.\nYes the \"dress code\" guy was kind of harsh, but we worked like it was an adult environment. There were adult expectations, and you found people were able to handle the adult customers with adult concerns and adult stress far more appropriately.",
