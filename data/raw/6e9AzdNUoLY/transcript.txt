these are the patterns and then by the time you get to him being like you're my baby mama I won it's just like we saw these red flags like okay he's this is the kind of man here to your point Olay like this notion of like well why didn't you leave well y'all make women feel like [ __ ] and then they get put in more of a bad situation and then you blame them for the bad situation that they stay in for the guys that has a pledge of allegiance to their patriarchal loyalty what is going to be the bright line for them of made being critical about ownership and pic so many people are endorsing that same type of mindset and then when the ramifications of that behavior shows up at that doorstep they act confused a man's love is treated as like the most valuable thing in a woman's love could be treated any kind of [Music] way let me say hello beautiful black people and talk about offsetting cardi yes I gotta leave in a few minutes I know so I'm G let you talk first then you seen what's happening with offs sudden cardi um you missing out on I mean so much is happening but this is it's so it's so good Ashley fill conscious in before you go okay yeah real quick we know they've separated but they did have a baby together recently cardi she goes on Instagram live just to kind of talk about you know how she ended up single uh issues they were having you know she's like he did everything to me he was cheating again and then offset gets in the chat and is like tell the truth you [ __ ] with a baby inside uh which was like oh okay that's oh you're just sharing that with the audience and then cardi gets on Twitter and tweets and [Laughter] did no it's and then it's like he's leaving other comments where he's like uh the world knows I don't want you like you know you're my baby mama so I want anyway and then she's showing to like messages between them where it's very clear he does want her he's like you know can I I want to jack off can I like get on the phone with you all just this kind of stuff it is too intimate and we should not know all of this but it's also incredible for anyone who wanted cardi to get her lick back which I did as someone who has been like please don't go back to offset this is just such a Wonder ful Way for their relationship to end to me it it's beautiful first of all I love cardi let me just say I I love cardi that's my [ __ ] like I've been Cardi's been my [ __ ] before like before Loving Hip Hop like original social media accounts getting deleted like that is my girl okay I was at cardi concerts in like before bodak yellow I love cardi um second of all the the funny thing about the discourse is right is like I see it's like all these men like oh my God like you're not a lady you you you why pregnant and it really just she was she man with offset baby inside oh my gosh and they're just just vile vile thing and then it's like okay but he did cheat on her while she was pregnant he cheated on his pregnant wife like three times over religious and it just goes to show like the level of ownership like the discourse that I I it's opened up that I really like is people talking about the way there are a lot of men who intentionally impregnate women because they think it will take them all take them you know take them out the game like all right now you're stuck with me now I you're Tethered to me in some way and second of all it's this idea like male Eagle like you think you own this woman like she is not able to go you can go cheat disown her you know what I mean whatever you saying you don't want her carry on do whatever you want religiously cheat on this woman religiously embarrassed this woman he's created like so I think we like take for granted how many issues offset has caused for cardi like I saw a good tweet that talked about it like how offset originally cardi getting in all them lawsuits fighting behind uh offset and stuff deals cost her money cost her years of time right and here you are like doing all this idea that like cardi is stuck dealing with you should you have a baby with you um and all these men like talking about like card's like Womanhood like oh cardi that you you have to understand don't make you a lady and I always think it's funny too that like even in Worlds where these like standards shouldn't apply like people love to get respectability politics with like with women even when it makes no sense like asset is a ghetto cardia is a Ghetto gal nothing about these what are we even talking about like why are you even about and that's his wife he's wife this woman all the things that you would think would would would mean that her like femininity or Womanhood or any of these things should not be open up to public discourse or whatever but somehow still is even though nothing about offset meets the the requisites for you being able to like [ __ ] on gent of being someone who wasn't going to get in an Instagram live and say that my ex-wife somebody with a baby inside and now he wants to like take her to core and all this it's like what are you going to sue her for what are you gonna it's not illegal she didn't they should have never gave you money I'm just you gotta run so say yeah what I say is as as uh consciously in this conversation I'm definitely glad I'm leaving early make sure you listen man my if I was a part of this conversation I I recognized every time I say something I'm be thinking about all right for the guys that has a pledge of allegiance to their patriarchal loyalty and you know I'm saying making sure they have to always hold that honor up what is going to be the bright line for them of May being critical about ownership and pandering what is gonna be critical to them and thinking about how what's be the to them and thinking critical about how we Orient oursel towards women and them thinking that I'm on I'm on here to try to pick up women you know what I'm saying I think that this is a important conversation to have because it showed me that there are different varying levels of patriarchy that a lot of us cisgender heterosexual men have and I think that a lot of it comes out when we talk about celebrities when we talk about offset and and you know I'm saying CI B Beyonce and Jay-Z or whatever celebr we talking about the way that jayen and will Jen and will Jen bill was the big one because it show right now what you just showed me and filling me in is that the ownership in the different different levels of of like loyalty and honor is something that can like write millions of books on because a lot of dudes feel like you know they got a key and they got a magic key that can open up any lock if you open up the door that's good but on the flip side feel like hey man any door that allows for any key to open it is a bad door it's just like now you have this very bad metal for that you really standing on that you believe and now it's coming up with how you show up for like your wife absolutely look at you look at you coming to give you your final words oh but yeah so that's that's you know I have a bunch of sensible people on so I don't even know like that that's the thing right like this is be a raging debate all over social media like men are like ah but all the men I talk to her like yeah that sense but listen I know most dudes though GNA be like n man that man that whole wild man that went wild can't believe she let another man enter in her while she had a baby in her they nut it all on the baby people are saying that is that yes this baby so this baby swimming in somebody else nuts like but is that even biologically possible no no exactly so what I'm saying like and it's like it's not like it's going to change who the daddy is it's not going to get her pregnant again what is D my baby some more nut on that baby because because it's more honestly it shows the way people like men like that use babies to Mark territory it's you know what I mean like that's what it is it's like I by have by me impregnating you that's mine and you can't do nothing but be with me cuz you got my baby in it ises about it though I'm sorry that was the line that really um jolted me um because people have been saying for years that offset Not only was setting back but he was using the children to do that and he very clearly indicated that these children are just a pawn for not only her attention but to hold her back yeah there's always been this unspoken um um possibility of him being jealous of her career because she's a much bigger star than he is particularly as a solo artist but then just like like oay said just the conventional ways in which some men will use children as a means to not only mark their territory but to keep their their woman in place and then for him to throw that back at her in the same vein when he's telling her I don't want you knowing that's not true I don't want you but I will have you cuz you're stuck with me cuz I gave you a baby my baby mother I you know what it'sing very future in Sierra that's what it's like their elements of that future in Sierra that I'm seeing here the way that the whole world thinking I want her to get with an athlete next I was like she deserves I want her to get with like just a nice athl who either like already has kids or is like we can have one more like just she deserves something like that future is top T worst ever do it and he really he I'm telling you future to follow the disciple of future or like exposed to you like such a serious CRI because I remember like I'm like the these young might not have been there but I was there okay when fut Sierra got together I was there what the I remember they future Sierra did love future goofy s down like so much so she named her first child future of baby named after his real name she Lov that so much he named her first child after his stage name okay let forget let's not me forget she got engaged to him that shortly before the wedding called off the wedding to Sierra and then went to the media Outlets like she too much like you know what her big Quan wife was talking bad but her oh she want me to come out the studio like not being studio all night she's all excited she making it she's such a celebrity she having this big celebrity wedding he was talking big [ __ ] like he don't want her she to Hollywood oh she not his down oh blah blah blah that was him I remember I'm a Wendy Williams religious watching my I remember so how is it he dog Siara then because Siara moov on we have we have been in Futures like upset we've been stuck in future group chat for like 10 plus years you get that baby getting ready to go off to college and this is still upset babies he still just sharing his diary still sad I want to say one thing before I leave man the irony of her talking about future and what I want to say before she bought him up every all the that's talking [ __ ] about cardi B right now are the sexual conquistadors that usually talk [ __ ] look I just [ __ ] your [ __ ] in some Gucci flip flopsy better watch his baby mama I baby mama I love sleeping with men's wife I love sleeping with married women most saying this right now are showing the double like like showing the the the the contradictory nature of being a sexual Conor had no problem you was hitting somebody else baby mama or somebody else wife somebody else girlfriend whether they was pregnant or not you G Slide up in there too but when you want to play respectability politics all of a sudden it's bad but nobody's condemning future for talking about sliding other people baby mama you know why and the thing is right you could tell men that and they will not feel like that's any gotcha because they' be like yeah men and women are different men win for women blah blah blah and and and they believe in that and they buy into that and they and they never like think about the convenience of believing in ideas that like like it it's funny like when you talk about anything else they call it an agenda right like anytime you talk about anything else everything is an agenda they could see how everything is a school of thought they could see this but whatever it comes to their belief in patriarchy and their belief in like male Supremacy and being different that is so godamn like no no no no no no no that's not man that's real yeah yeah oh my go only to your point though and conscious' earlier point so much of it speaks to the unspoken expectation of their ability to own a woman's sexuality and because again it's like I don't necessarily want to be committed to you in any type of meaningful way but I don't necessarily want you to have the Liberty to go off and be with someone else either that's what future did with Sierra that's what offset is doing with cardi and it's just it's so unfortunate too because just like K said right before he left so many people are endorsing that same type of mindset sure um endorsing the music glorifying the behavior and then when the ramifications of that behavior shows up at that doorstep they act confused and it's just like what do you really want out of all of this right yeah I think it it really is about just the power dynamics it isn't about sort of the consent people want to to see pregnant women as just incubators and they can't believe that they they remain autonomous human beings uh a few months ago I tweeted about I'm polyamorous and I was tweeting about how I have you know dated people who are married they get pregnant and the pregnant woman continues to date other people in the polyamorous relation and people men were just like you're lying this is not true this could not no this isn't a real thing and plenty of like pregnant pow women were like yeah no I mean I didn't see a reason to not see my other partners just because my primary like got me pregnant or you know to stop seeing people and people just got so angry and we're like these women are [ __ ] they're horrible people oh their children should be taken away and it's like what is so wrong about these adult women having consenting sexual Dynamics with people that they want to have sex with what what upsets you so much just because they're pregnant like you have no problem if it's like it's just the pregnant thing what is it about that that makes you go you're not your own anymore you get to control your body you don't get to say I want to sleep with this person anymore well that's exactly it right people don't believe in women having choice and they and they and they resent when women have lots of choices that's why they hate successful women they hate educated women they hate the idea that's why you see like Republicans trying to attack no fault divorce and all this they hate the idea that women can choose not to be with you to not be with you to have free reign that's why like when you think about how Society is invested in putting down or even just if you just looked at our own the black community right a smaller um subset the way we are invested in putting down the baby mother is like a serious serious reflection I like when I think about the way um uh uh Kevin Samuels would talk about any anyone oh you have children you're a low value woman right you're a baby mother right like oh you're not going to be how dare you like the only thing that offends them more like like than the idea that you think that you that you even want you think you should be able to get a good man or a high value man or have any other options the only thing that offends them more is you actually being able to do it and that's why it upsets that's why Russell Sim like Russell Williams Russell Wilson upsets them to this day Russell Wilson upsets them to this day right because in their idea that like by making you a baby mother like you should not you have less options you are you are not desirable and you should feel that way and you should operate that way and if you think of yourself as less than which they think you should feel that way because oh you're a baby mother you will then like treat them accept a certain level of conduct move in a certain way and that is the thing that is offensive and and offensive to them so that's the inherently angering thing about like cardi like how dare you like you have multiple children for this man he has impregnated you and he should be able to say I don't want you I don't want you I don't want to treat this way I should be able to do this thing or even if even if they even if they'll they'll scold men like they pretend to scold men they'll say things like they be like oh yeah AET shouldn't cheat on his pregnant wife but but still but whatever it should always be that no matter like maybe there are loose guidelines for how a man should be but if a man should choose to completely like abscond from his responsibilities or the framework where he created for like what a high value man is a woman should still be obligated to play her like play her role in her position which is underneath him and not and that's what it seems like to me yeah I was going to even say I think about Fantasia the same way of Fantasia too if you really been following Fantasia in her journey right so before she met the the gentleman that she's with now who i' I've been in the same room with him like the their love is something that it's just it's beautiful to watch like he loves Fantasia house down boots and it's interesting to watch like what she's gone through to get to this love and how people treated her in in in her journey of it was almost like Fantasia shouldn't love herself or shouldn't care about herself because of all of the bad experiences that she had with love and now it's like you know I you know I always kind of come back to that that point of like sexism and massag Noir the hatred of women is built into everything and it really boggles my mind it's like why wouldn't you like why would you I don't know May and maybe it's because I'm also married like why wouldn't you want your partner to be happy why why why would why would you say mean thing like why would you like I there all of these wise that I have every time I think about this and it's just you know I I the only thing I can really say in ending like in ending this for me is I just pray for cardi I really do like and when I say I pray it's not even like a I'm a Christian I'm a pray it's like like I hope she has a strong like I hope between her sister between her mother like whatever whatever she has around her I hope it's protecting her because I can only imagine the stuff that the stuff that we're seeing right now I'm thinking about like what what else are we not seeing like yeah there's like that that's the thing I think that worries me more in this conversation than anything yeah John to your point I saw an article a few years ago um and they were they were analyzing the the content of R&B songs over like the last 30 40 years and the headline or the tagline was something like black people don't sing about love anymore and they were talking about the erosion and different iterations of love being talked about in the content and when you were talking one of the things I was thinking about is aside from just the music and everything else just there's this erosion of people wanting to enter into a partnership with people that's genuinely loving and mutually affirming and they'll say they want the benefits of that or at least want someone subservient to them so they can get part of the benefit of that but you you don't see that in some of the way these public figures are moving and obviously I don't know these people but what but what you see of what they put publicly out there particularly like these text messages and these social media comments and things like that like I was saying before it's such a vile thing to say even if your romantic relationship dissolves you all are still co-parenting you still have a bond that will last the rest of your lifetime because you created a life together and so multiple multiple lives together that's right the mother three kids right three children yeah and cardi was also yeah to his other kids so like those Bonds are there they had like you know a pretty blended family and you know John what you said does remind me of what's going on with Victoria Monae she her part and people immediately had to find a way to blame it on her they're like finding videos from 10 months ago where she's you know dancing with women and they're like see this is why that they broke up this he couldn't handled this it's her fault because she was out here like this and it's just like they said it's mutual they're both in different places but we have to find a woman to blame we have to you know find a reason to go see this is what women are like you know and it's it's just I it's wild right now our society doesn't because we live in a patriarchal society nobody likes women including women and it's so un it's so unfortunate because when you brought up John when you brought up Fantasia made me think of this video I watched recently on rrg on YouTube and I love real reality gossip me and my me and my boyfriend stay watching them but they are they the aunties right Auntie Regina there's a so there's an old black lady patriarchal like frame of mind she'll get in right and then she has a video about how Fantasia and her husband's relationship is a hot snake and mess and I remember watching the whole thing and it wasn't nothing wrong with it like it was like a great relationship but because Fantasia made more money or Fantasia approached him first whatever she kept like they kept implying in the video that he don't really want Fantasia and you're supposed to let a man chase you and you're not supposed to love a man more and it's supposed to be this and it's supposed to be that and it's like people are so afraid it's funny because everybody wants this like love and partnership that everybody is too scared to be vulnerable enough to have it's like everybody I was having a conversation with my baby sister um like this this weekend and we were talking and I she was like talking about you know like like having a man who loves you more than you love him and I was like or we can love each other equally right like like it's that it's that fear that makes you feel because you see a society where you so often see women not being treated right or men not willing to love them out loud or treat them with like a certain care and so we flip you know what I mean the flip side is just to is to feel like oh well I need one that loves me more when I don't love him as much or whatever and that and that all that is rooted in fear and we wouldn't have that if we didn't like have these ideas that like a hierarchy wait you you adjusted and you see and I saw that shirt oh you listen this is oh this is Eric Adam's indictment day what you mean tell you can get the shirt the shirt anti L I'mma put the Aon put the link on the on the screen yes you can pre-order yours I know I shouldn't be doing this dur your show but my God that took me out was not prepared you don't know how hard I'm working to talk about anything other than your Adams today I'm like oh Lord why is we had a flow but that shirt I was like we're not going to get past this shirt we not going to let this go I have it a mulp sorry okay we can go back go ahead I'm sorry yes but yeah no I was just saying it's our like beliefs in these like gender roles and like these hierarchies and all these things that like just be causing us so much grief and it just makes it like impossible because so often like I was having this conversation with my sisters even when you look at how women and I bro I feel this one deeply the way women are made to feel like women should be embarrassed for what men do in relationships is crazy like even how we talk about it it's always like oh he embarrassed her like even when we talk about why like we're so mad at a particular man like cuz he embarrassed her and what we I think I'm like we as a society need to reframe this like we need to stop thinking about it that way because not only do we like put men's actions on women you know what I mean and like we still find a way to like shame them and make that about women what happens too is we then like put like castigate women if they don't if we perceive a man as having embarrassed them or whatever it is like now I'm you're treating the woman like we believe we should layer on abuse oh a man is making a fool of you he's abusing you let's abuse you too you dumb [ __ ] you should have gone and like I swear should have known you should have just left why did you put up with that I'm so exhausted with seeing women on the internet like [ __ ] on women that they should be lending Compassion or whatever because you find her romantic situation to be embarrassing or you don't like the man that she's with and I find that so crazy because as a woman I'm like everybody I know every single human being that I know has been in a relationship with somebody who's treated them like [ __ ] or done wrong by them or whatever have you whatever I don't understand why we do that on the internet like you don't like ddg as a partner you don't like so now you you [ __ ] on H every chance you get right fabulous knocks Emily Bee's teeth out of her mouth and she and she stays with him so y'all hate her like you know what I mean you call her a dummy every time that you see her you know what I mean and I'm like how do y'all find this as a society like how do you think you're you're giving women the strength to leave situations like this right because I'm like if cardi B if every time what do you think Len makes cardi B stay with a man she has children for like it what would make her stay is a society that every time tells her like oh you you you you already have all his children look how he's embarrassing you look it's that's what makes people feel like they need to try and pretend like they need to try and build home and cover it up and do all of that you keep people stuck in these shitty situations by making them feel ashamed like when you when you see how many people like isolate themselves from their support systems and their friends and their families and their communities to stay in bad relationships and be quiet when you find out what it is at its root it's shame and they wouldn't feel that shame if we didn't somehow think that people should feel ashamed of like loving a person caring about a person who's done something to them like we never are willing to put like hold the people responsible it's just funny because it's like I keep thinking now that now that I'm an adult and now I can process this different like like I said I I me I said earlier like Bobby and Whitney and I'm thinking about like all of these folks and then like I think the the other scary part for me is like in thinking about this and the grand scheme of it all too like to your point O like this notion of like well why didn't you leave right why didn't the woman leave and it's like well y'all basically make women feel like [ __ ] every time they they stand up for themselves so they stay and then they get put in more of a bad situation and then you blame them for the bad situation that they stay in so is it Uchi Wally or is it one mik like we can't because what is it it's giving very much like everyone I don't know everyone's pointing blame and to that point too we treat women like they're damaged goods if they come out of a relationship where they've been harmed by their partner it's kind of like what oay was saying before they act like or cardi or Fantasia are Unworthy of love because they have a partner who harmed them or manipulated them or whatever um they did and that is another contributing factor as well because they've got this larger external societal pressure it makes me think of who is I like what what um you know what it makes me think of D especially with you bringing up um Ashley Victoria Monae and them trying to pull up cuz I had seen this I'm trying to be like oh I seen her hanging with her AES K so it must be y yada y it makes me think again rrg I when Tiana Taylor and and Iman went to separate oh my God I me like the dialogue got to agressive immediately and it's funny because just the night before everybody loved to post pictures uh T man there a perfect I can't I them and it was crazy because everything that we had seen from the documents that ended up being public because iman's ass went and made them public right when Tiana went out of her ways to keep it private revealed that he's doing [ __ ] and somehow it was people like oh they had I had threesoms and she shouldn't allow that and all these different things that like that means automatically assistly it's funny like we always I think it's funny to see so many people fail at traditional nuclear family Norms but then constantly act as though anybody who does anything different that's the reason your [ __ ] wasn't successful like she was a million specific reasons for why their marriage like fell apart that didn't have [ __ ] to do with her being bisexual didn't have [ __ ] to do with them having threesoms or anything but somehow that became the standard because you as a woman would allow this because everything is like there's no like it's like to what you were talking about Ashley earlier with uh paully Amory there's no like people can genuinely want and desire different dynamics that they can all like be you know what I mean it can never it can never be that it's always a reflection everything is to believe that is a reflection of a man not wanting you you know what I mean or a man or trying insecurities you have issues it can never be like oh no this was a situation that we all were into yes like I genuinely don't believe Victoria Mona's man left her because she was dancing with women and it was hot like I I don't think that was it yes yeah it and then the and then I'm sure like I was going to add on to that it's the what did you do to make him treat you this way too of it all right what was cardi doing to make him want to step out on you what was Victoria doing to make him want like there's all these these games that people play around that to put it back on the onus of the black woman that she's somehow the problem when in reality you know masculinity in itself is the problem so yeah and then even to O's earliest point about um offset and cardi and not conforming to cons respectability politics what about what they have presented publicly makes you think that they will fit into your expectation of what is normative am because nothing that they have demonstrated publicly is is is giving the impression that they're going to live this fairy tale romance that people projected on to them especially when we heard very early on that behind the scenes things weren't what they appeared to be exactly right exactly and yet we yet we insist right like and and it's crazy because the dialogues it doesn't matter what dynamic what relationship it is that we get in our like public sphere it always devolves like this right like um who was it recently um that they did the same Kiki Palmer Kiki Palmer and remember that let's go back yes like I'm like Kiki Palmer Somebody Loved celebrated black people love this is and the next thing the minute like a a man y'all don't know from nowhere you know what I mean like decides he don't like what she has to say immediately everybody is like it it's funny like how some like the the um the allly [ __ ] men feel to men's her feelings her ego like the idea that a man feels emasculated is like shining a light in the sky to to men everywhere like Jesus drop what you are doing a man needs our a I never heard of him before never cared about him before but the second they're like a man in need is in need they come in and it's like why you this person right dead ass dead ass conly try to disparage Kiki now like I'm constantly seeing conspiracy videos pop up trying to be like oh she made up the abuse oh look at how they drive away men oh this is is the next thing and I'm like it's it's always that like women it's funny because our society just in genu and and it always demonizes women who leave men like when you think of even like how and I know everybody everybody hates JLo now but let me let me let me be the one to say it's crazy how like don't know like it's so nuts right because like a million men could choose to be with a woman could choose to be with a woman and that'll never be a reflection of like anything good about her or anything about why like men would want to be with that and that'll never be a positive reflection but a woman leaving a bunch of men somehow even her making the Choice the executive decision like a h Berry to leave these men always means something is wrong with us you can't get no man I I saw H Berry exist in breathing mind in her business in an interview clip the other day and the entire comment section was nobody talking about how see but she can't keep no man and men always leave her and she ain't all this and she ain't all that and I'm like this metric of like because nobody believes it tells me like Society in general does not believe that any woman could desire anything more than needing to be like a man has to claim you you know what I mean a man has to be laying claim to you like that when you think of how much we like we treasure that and we cherish that like in and of itself like I think of how often like anytime if a woman like Praises herself like she's immediately like a narcissist she said this you don't like her confidence but [ __ ] loves herself she cherishes herself that's the problem but we like CET a man seeming like he loves his wife every time if a man even look at his woman in a nice GIF everyone's like oh go you know what mean like and that coveting of a man's like a man's love a man's love is treated as like like the ultimate thing like usually like the most valuable thing in a woman's love is treated as to like could be treated any kind of way it's treated as to be expected to be assumed like you are entitled to that love right but a man's love is an honor right like and I I don't know how we I don't know how we break away from that as a society I'm not sure stay childless cat women you know I think that no serious like no like like as much much as as much as that make some people may say well John how are you going to make the connection there the reality is is that the only way for for us to really be able to kind of break down and Chip down it's funny because so I'll say this before I make my point like me and my husband are our our go to bed show is Lucy and we watch Lucy often and Lucy yeah over and over love my big sister love yeah it's just it's for me it's an easy show to watch before I go to bed I don't want to watch people yelling I don't want to watch people arguing it's fun and it's light and it's easy for me to turn over and go to bed to but there are moments where we'll be watching the show and I'll look over at him and he'll look at me and we we can clearly see the misogyny that'll play out or we'll see the moments where it's like like for instance the episode we were watching last night was the episode where she was I guess he Ricky got a new manager and the manager was watching their money and basically was telling Lucy that she can't spend money the way she wanted to so she started running the scam of going to the grocery store for the people in her building so they could give her the money and she could that money to go get her hair done and to buy clothes all that to be said I'm thinking to myself she got all these groceries in her kitchen how does how does Ricky not know that and then my husband looked at me and he was like because men are not supposed to be in the kitchen remember right it was the 50s and so it's like it's it's it's moments like that where I think about like to my point I'm thinking like there there's there all of these like for years and for hund like lit I'm G say hundreds but for a very long time it's always been women do this and women need to to do exactly that and if they deviate from that then they are now the problem they are they're devilish they're this they're that and that's the reason why that man felt so comfortable getting on a stage a national stage and to say if you don't have children if you're not married you and you love cats then you're the problem right and it's it's you know how do we get away from that well women need to keep doing it right like Taylor Swift I don't I don't go up for that lady but what I will say is that I love the idea of her throwing a cat on her shoulder and being like you because you know what I mean like that that's what women have to keep doing they literally have to keep throwing a finger up in order for for the systems to change wild the Trap wife stuff is working for some of these younger women you get on Tik Tok and there're really just younger girls who are like oh my gosh this like Mormon lady with five kids is living my dream I just want to cook all day and make my own Coca-Cola like like it's really working and it's like I don't know how we're kind of moving backwards with some younger people it was so funny though there was always when you think about it the only thing that makes me feel a little bit like less panicked so like like oh my God we're going in the wrong direction is that I just remember I remember being a women's gender studies class in college and like a bunch of white girls in the class raising their hand telling me they were only in college to find a man like you know what I mean and so it reminds me that like they have always been sisters that have these like ideas and thought processes funny because like when you see people like when it's why it's so important I think to understand like the systems around you right because I was like I like I think to me the most like some of the most important things to picking a partner and like want like a good stable relationship are people who see the world the way that you see it and then when I say that I mean not being with a man who's a misogynist not being with a man who's a you know what I mean and those things like matter more than so so many other things but when people don't get that like they don't they've not heard or been exposed to those things like they don't realize like okay misogyny is a thing patriarchy and all these different things and how this happens they don't see they don't see walk into these Dynamics cuz like my boyfriend has a has a female friend who um she like she's always like ending up in these abusive like kind of like abusive relationships because she's always trying she chooses men that like believe like she it's so clear like she she wants men who are like going to be controlling and who are going to be this and seek all these different things that I'm like if you zoomed out for a second you would see how the next steps are this you know what I mean like if you she'll be talking about like oh I want a like I want a rich man who pays for everything and takes care and does all this and yada yada Y and I'm like you're constantly setting up a dynamic where you are powerless you know what I mean like where you are where you are seeking out a man who sees women as being something to be quiet to be demure to be very mindful to be taken care of you know what I mean you can be bought and paid for and be good if I give you the money and I got your hair done and why won't you do what I say exactly and it it has always blown me I always felt like in my 20s when people like my relationship problems like were always based in something like ideological to me like I could identify was ideological whereas I feel like when you hear people talk about their relationship problems it'll be like oh it's so toxic or are these other like generic things but I'm like no no no they're actual like you could figure out what the is happening here you know what I mean if you date a man like who believes that women are less than or women shouldn't have a like they will have these men that they like love and celebrate who have all these like open viewpoints that show they will never respect you or treat you as whole and they like don't see it like I remember thinking right you know it was an example and I like like walk a flock of flame has always comes off very likable until people are talking about LGBT rights or anything right he always he always seems so likable until LGBT rights come to the table oh God but I always remember I I remember like noticing this right like because you would watch like when when Tammy Rivera was with Waka Flocka when they were still married like Tammy had all these problems like Wala seemed so nice and so you know lovable and all of this or whatever and he's a good dad but he was always a terrible husband and a terrible partner and when you would hear his thoughts about the LGBT community and on like women and all these different things they'd be like that's why like you're trying to figure out like why like you know what I mean you know what he thinks that's what it is like and they don't see it like and it would be funny because Tammy would [ __ ] on wer about being like a cheater and being a shitty husband but she'd always go to the mat for him on like his ideological beliefs and I'm like his ideological beliefs are the reason he is a cheat and a this and a that and you know what I mean and like they don't see the connection I'm like you being with men who like believe are invested in these kind of oppressive systems are the reason they have oppressive structures in your household in your relationship Dynamics with them like I never understand how women thinks unrelated like you'll see all these videos of of women like wanting their man to like not open the door for other women or to like think other women like the amount of women who think of it as like a badge of honor to be with a man who thinks every other woman is [ __ ] and holes but thinks you're special you know what I mean and you don't see like how that's going to negatively impact you I'm just like sisters you're not going to be the only woman he's nice to you're not you're never going to be it's never going to be that it will creep in the way he treats other people other women specifically will be will in it will be exactly how he treats you it's in in so many ways and so my wife and I we will um celebrate 16 years of marriage in November hey I love her I I love her too let her what what what I was saying with that is we don't volunteer marriage advice but to the extent that people ask one of the first things we say is what Olay is talking about one of the most important things that you have to consider when deciding to partner your life with someone is that you share values you don't have to agree on the minutia of every detail of Life of what's most important to you should be something that they share so the things that keep you up at Night the things that your passion about the things that govern your life y'all should agree on those things and if you don't like like o is saying You're Building you're building things on a faulty foundation and things will crumble later will because even because the other thing we tell people too which is like the person needs to genuinely love you like that's but even like the idea of like what does it mean to genuinely love you is again based on a shared value of what love is so you have to really have to come together and understand those things before you try to build something else and like you said we see all these different examples like offset to kind of get back to what we've been talking about all this time has told us who he is what he believes how he views women how he reviews his status in a relationship and even once his domineering patriarchal control over his relationship even though his wife earns more than him and is a bigger entity in their industry he still wants this level of control that's who he is yeah everything he's told us about who he is is a reflection of that and so it doesn't surprise me that he thinks that he can cheat on cardi for most if not all of their relationship and then be offended when she says I'm ready to move on right and can't wait to put her on and you know I always think it's funny he can't wait to put her on every solo project anytime anytime offet trying to do anything any real can't wait to get cardi because you recognize what her star power is and it's like you like it when it serves you you know what I mean when when it when it benefits you like it's and the crazy part is like I like Offset generically you know what I mean like I like offset is just like you know a a character out there you know yeah I and I even like them together you know for a bit at least like through you know F the first kid but then it just became so clear that they were stuck in this Dynamic where he every time she wanted to leave every time something bigger was happening for her he had to step in get her pregnant and it just start I think the thing that really for me when she performed at at some Festival in LA and he like surprised her on stage and it was like with him yeah yeah and it's like this is her moment and you're going to manipulate her like that and that's when it kind of was like okay these are the patterns and then by the time you get to him being like I you're my baby mama I won it's just like we saw these red flags like okay he's this is the kind of man he is you know what's the thing you know what's funny like do we remember how we found out cardi was having her first child when she unveiled it in the white dress singing be careful a song about this being a piece of [ __ ] like be careful with me like I'm going to believe you do you remember that we actually found about remember T's first like reveal was like be careful it was like before invasion of privacy Dro when she dropped be careful as a single she had on the white dress she was pregnant she was performing on like I think Jimmy Kimmel or something and she like they zoomed out like it starts up with her hair like performing clearly I'm a real fan uh her performing the song like this and they zoom out to show the belly as she's singing be careful and so it's like this man has like that's been the beginning like their entire entire relationship has has been him getting her pregnant and her threatening to leave him and trying to like find some kind of stakes that could get him to perform and like I guess here's the thing with with Cardi's situation that's so like stressful for me right like I remember at fir because on so many ways I hated for cardi but in so many ways I think cardi has shown I love when women transcend like beliefs like like I say this to say when cardi first got pregnant everybody thought that was going to be it like oh that was still I feel like cardi made a way for like I think cardi made possible for the young Miami to be pregnant and working the way that they are because I remember when cardi got pregnant everybody was like oh [ __ ] you ruined it like bodak yellow you're at a run it's going to be over and when she dropped Invasion and privacy and I like it and all these hits and she kept like going I think that like really that like that shows something amazing so like in some ways like to what John was saying earlier like how do we like beat this untrained Society it's for women to [ __ ] you to like Buck it and like keep figuring out like you have to see some women who are able to like go through it and do it both and still be successful and all that so gu like even though I hatte it for cardi I also love that cardi has been able to still be cardi and be so successful even though keep spinning out these babies for this and I want her to be free but also I'm impressed you know like like so and you know what she did her big one with this and did you know they are some cute little babies yeah their babies are very cute they do make some cute babies but I you know and that's the other thing too I I will say like I I I know I I also worry about the B babies and all this right I can remember the the back and forth with my my my mom and my birth father I don't even refer to him as my father but my birth father like the the back and forth and while I'm very like I've I've I've always said this and I even say it in my book um I say I'm so grateful that my father stayed away because there were there like my mom and their energy was so toxic that even for me at the age of four like I remember it and it and it carried with me as a child and so like as much as I'm like like I I hear the like my concern is with cardi I'm also very concerned you know with love I don't say it with like oh you know like I feel simp like I want I want to it's it's a very it's a genuine like I really hope like I said I I I keep going back to this I hope that there is somebody functional or somebody with some sense around her that can really help ground these children and ground what's going on because to be because and again was a poor little kid in San Bernardino in the middle of nowhere these babies have parents that are famous like famous famous that's the thing I think that's really like in my mind in the back of my mind I'm like God protect the babies yeah you know and you know you know something I've been seeing a lot of people talk about lately that I think ties into it is this there's always this discussion of whether or not you can be a good a good father and be a piece of [ __ ] to the mother of the children and people love to swear that you can be and it's because that's what is more convenient for it to be true and let me tell you something like I both my parents are tumultuous and a hot mass in their on right like they've like neither one has been perfect as a parent neither one has been perfect to a partner to each other I don't personally think that they are people who are compatible or should have been procreating but thank God for life um but you know what I mean and like I have like I've had all kind of crazy things and thought processes about my parents throughout my entire life but if there was at any point where my father went online calling my mommy talking about my mommy like she ain't a child of go you know what I mean like nobody wants you talking about who my mommy is [ __ ] or not that's crazy like it's it's insane and the way people think that you can like it's funny because men will understand how can't be their boy and disrespect their other boy but like well pretend like they could be a good daddy you know what I mean and [ __ ] on your mother and it's funny because men don't like when no one [ __ ] on their M like you can't say anything but they mommy but they believe that they could be good Fathers while mistreating the mothers of their children and I cannot understand it I'm like yeah it doesn't it doesn't compute and and and and another thing another reason that I think like people need to just guess just be more so much more selective about who they like procreate with is people I I was saying this recently people take for granted they think it's a cliche like when you say like oh you don't like you don't love yourself or you don't love this person that you're with and how that creates a problem but like as someone who's known parents like this and had a tumultuous childhood when people don't like themsel and they don't they truly like the people that they like they don't have good relationships with the people that they are making children with they might want a relationship with them they might wish it could be this and that but they don't like that person or how they've been treated all that resentment all that this that's all they see when they look at these children and I think people like are not honest about that like children are the creation of this you know what I mean like I remember you know how much times in my life as a child my mommy would be like my mommy would look at me like oh you just like your daddy and say you and be like the the like the seasoning of upsetness that they feel when when she was upset never like when you did something good never remind me of your no it was always like you Dad you remind me of your father like dead ass and it's like who else would and I remember my daddy always my daddy would say one time my mommy said something insulting to me like like about being short and my daddy was like my daddy was like who's who's child is she my daddy short like of course she like what did you expect her to be like you know what I mean to look like and it's true it's like people will will be in relationships with people who don't treat them right who they don't like who they have years and years of resentment and Trauma built up with and then create and then don't and don't feel too good about themselves in the first place which you don't like themselves very much which is why they accept these kinds of relationships so then they create people who they look at and they see nothing but you know amalgamations of two people don't like they don't like themselves and this other person and what kind of relationship do they think they have with the child and how do you think that affects like the child's sense of self the child sense of what they accept in a relationship and all these things I'm just like there's so much like selfishness to it that is just like not considered you know it's it's so important who you procreate with is such or just partner your life with is such an important decision it it it truly is and um tell again not don't volunteer parenting advice listen I'm not trying to like be a content creator with like you know this how you do whatever whatever but like um we feel you but to the extent that people ask because I I do have three children I have a 14y old a 12y old and a nine-year-old and um to the extent that people ask God bless your home I'm sorry I know that energy God bless the energy in your home I'm put up a picture of Timothy's family flash they're so God yeah there there's some beautiful little people but they're a handful but the thing is though I knew going in that they're going to get their first view of manhood from me their first view of Womanhood from My Wife and that again how we interact with each other how we comport ourselves in front of them is going to be foundational to who they become they ultimately will become their own people but so much of that will be shaped by us and again that's that goes back to what we were just talking about how I treat my wife is Paramount to how my daughters are learning how to expect to be treated by a man how my son is learning how to expect to treat a woman and just also just how to be a good human being in a partnership and so that that that is so important and is again something that people need to think about and we at times see too many people casually entering into these lifelong obligations with other people I it's funny because me and my partner are trash TV watching it's a 90day fiance abely hello I will watch it and immediately there this season there was a woman who went overseas to be with this man and she's like I'm pregnant and I'm like girl you don't know him like that's IM my immediate concern becomes oh my God like I even think about old episodes right when you think about what's what's mama who ran off with uh with her her Hall Pass um the the Asian one she had that hall pass he gave her the h and she end up running off with him oh Kanani I think her name Isani yes after his ass was cheating for forever to day after he cheated the whole relationship but then but she did at couple therapy bring her side piece and cheat at coup's therapy is on par with what cardi did cuz she's pregnant by him now let's they already hadab they had a baby yeah yeah so not to divert the conversation but what I'm saying is like like immediately my mind always goes back to you don't notice like you're having a child like literally in my mind like when I watch these shows and these women be like I'm pregnant by this man that I met on this trip I'm like you don't know him you don't know anything like I've been with my husband for 14 years and there are still things that that does that I'm like where the [ __ ] did that come from what there's another there's another couple this season Tiger Lily and Adan I was GNA bring them up Adnan is so controlling and then Tiger Lily is like I've never seen this sight of him and like this is also the first time you've ever met him you've seen no side of him you don't know him and then she's like but I love that he's controlling cuz it means he loves me I said she going to end up like that Tik Tock story you heard about that TI Tok story yeah the Tik Tok story on P that documentary not yet keyword yet Ty told us that she was with a man like a super super super rich man who controlled her life for 10 years she was like I was trapped she just got divorced and Her First Act course of action is to go find a Muslim man to go meet and marry the same the same day old Muslim boy control her life I'm like [ __ ] are you crazy her community to bring her in the people who her community is there her best friends are there going girl are you serious right now he won't let me be alone in a room with you I'm a gay man and I'm your best friend like what is wrong with him and she's just like I you guys are gonna love him like just get to know him and like she even has children back home and she knows her children aren't going to like this situation and she just doesn't want to deal with the reality it's it's crazy no it it really really really truly be nuts like you be seeing the choices that people make and I just be like what what what exactly what is going on what is going on what is going on I literally ask that question at least three times a day out here [Music]
