you know that there are gay people you just genuinely believe they should have to live in secret ask yourself as a parent as a loved one is to ask yourself what does it mean to love this person what does it mean to love anyone so I think we need to be honest that this isn't about opinion this is about either your sustaining black life or you are snuffing it out he's saying a lot of things that people are thinking whether that whether that majority of people be the ignorant he's speaking the [ __ ] that nobody wants to say folks don't know what to do when the culture shifts and so once you are made aware of the thing you are now accountable to change we understand that queer people exist we understand that they're in the world you just don't want your child to be yet you just don't want that to be attach to [Music] you hello beautiful black people I bring yall here to talk about a plague in our community named Lil boozy and I'm going to hand it off to y'all in a second I guess I'm going to open this by saying Lil boozy had Lil booie has a consistent homophobia threat of homophobia and I am not somebody who generally subscribes to the when people are being homophobic be like you know question their sexuality or why because I believe hate can just be hate hate is not always like hidden in something however Lil booie is specifically when he was on that little n x threat I remember a specific paragraph I read from him complaining about specifically saying like oh like suggesting that Lil NX is tempting like his reason for why he has this beef and problem with Lil NAX is they are all these these boys and men trying to be straight that's what he said trying to be straight and then they got to see Lil NX and I knew what it was then so I so that's first but now his most recent comments uh uh I'm gonna like play it at some point some of it at least probably not all cuz who has the emotional capacity for it all of like the homophobic he's like uh the homophobic Miss like abuse of his daughter and that's in keeping with a man who has paid for sex workers to rape his his young boys like I'm not surprised that you're abusing and mistreating your other children um but I think my greater issue is the fact that refused to let L boozi go like and and not only did refuse to let Lil booie go I believe that Lil boozy is an example of like Tory Lan who the community has decided to embrace more after they be fed up like you didn't love this this way and then he got to be a really loud problematic character and now you love this and I think that is a greater problem to me the way like people want to defend this homophobia like it's like ly does these things that are just so outright abusive and [ __ ] up and usually towards his own children they're usually built out of a a hatred he ass for his own kids I didn't even know his daughter was his daughter was gay until she's basically like oh this is a continued thing that's why this outspoken homophobia you know so to the room um yeah I want to I want to address the first part of what you said first because obviously hyper homophobia does not mean that um you are also queer right that people can just be hateful I I 100% agree with that but I do think that booy is a particular case and somebody does need to do some investigative work um because I remember watching the video and during the video he said um so many women are out here battling with women on Instagram you got to battle with all these women and now you gota why you want to battle with a M why you got to battle with a m and it's like the implicit message in that statement is that you believe that these fem presenting men that these non-binary men right or even that these trans women because we know that a lot of times homophobic men do not make a distinction between gay men and trans women right you believe that they have the capacity to attract straight men right or what you would deem straight men you you believe the implicit statement is that you think that these people are attractive um and I think the somebody really needs to get to say the quiet part out loud I don't know if he's queer or not I know that he has a disgusting a yeah disgusting relationship with sexuality um because of what you said at the beginning of this video um but I do think that it's a little interesting I won't say what he is because it's sexuality is a matter of identification right sexual activity does not equal sexual identification or orientation but um he's a very curious curious curious man I'll say can can you speculate just for like can you speculate just for like [ __ ] Giggles Herby said I am a responsible person said no I unable to participate in that actually you know Savannah slow down Savannah slow down not right now was responsible content media training no actually there you go next question thank you I just know that there's a [ __ ] out there who has [ __ ] with him and put that blast I give you a, but I think it's also like interesting because he's also like equating it to he continues to talk around being a choice and then he's also equating um his daughter's sexuality around how she can contaminate and I think that's important to like think around that because he thinks you can like spread the gay right and I'm just like that's it's not how that works because if that was the case everybody seeing a bunch of straight [ __ ] growing up would inevitably be straight that's not how it happened right and so I'm always like super interested especially like when he was talking this comment ended up coming up because he was talking to karisha on a live Revol show in Atlanta Georgia and I'm just like karisha was like why you always in gay people's business and then he was just like well I'm I'm gonna talk on now because I had to I had to write this down he said I just speak on what I disagree with and I said oh well there goes the comment right there and so the audience is having like very visceral reaction as this thing is happening I'm like karisha being the one that asked the question I said girl you're being messy but you also don't have a track record in terms of your own homophobia but secondly you already knew how he was going to react like there's going to be an actual thing that goes on and so like for me I'm like nah dog not today and so I think adding that context is important yeah I think also there's something particular like there's a particular type of queer person that boozy is antagonized by internally and antagonizes right he's not dealing with masculine right he's going for Trans folk going for non-binary folk and going on bolks that are seemen to be pretty or somewhere on the perceived feminine perspect uh uh Spectrum right and I think that's really interesting I remember the quote uh so sad to say but the quote he made about Zade right not just that they were a trans child but automatically it went to don't cut off his dick bro what this is a 12-year old right and so your concern here isn't necessarily sexuality itself but I think it goes back to Marisa saying it's this idea of a contamination of a certain type of manhood right whether it's gay or bisexual or not there's something about the black male body and pro possibly his own body that is destabilized right by just seeing something that he might particularly be attracted to and I don't and that doesn't mean that he's queer right because I think that sexuality is a really interesting and fluid thing but it goes to say something when you make the comment to your point earlier earlier Herby that what does it mean then that you're concerned about their competing with women right what what is the competition and what how is that competition legible to you and so in your mind there's a competition right there's a scarcity of beauty and so for me it's like wow we're really watching you if we're getting into a little psycho analytics we're really watching you work out your own demons on yourself so what we're talking about is the kind of lack of stability of your own Essence right yeah and that is nuts it's it's it's you know it's interesting it's because they're afraid right like everything based on what he communicates is like I'm afraid of the idea that like people will perceive me in this way like my sexuality and my masculinity would be perceived this way and what what angers me is that I might have this attraction to these people and that will I believe that then reflects negatively on my sexuality or my masculinity and that I'm going to be thought of in this way and so that is why I am angry at you and you see it right like not just with L booie but even like I was thinking of Benzino like recently Benzino Benzino has Bas I hate I hate that the community like even like treats it like they're catching people talking to trans women or anything like that but I remember someone put out uh that benino was benzo's baby mother put it out actually to that he was texting or talking to a trans woman so trans woman and so benino went to like deny it and like completely like oh not true so the transom put out the the actual truth and then she posted like all his audio notes and like text messages of him like threatening to kill her basically being like oh you don't understand it's not you who's going to look bad as me cuz people are going to be like oh why you with a transgender and then he goes on this whole tie raid about wanting to killer and the thing is is like people move on like it's drama and I'm like that's real life serious because I'm like there's a reason why trans women particularly black Trans women are at the highest rates of violence and murder and the and the fact that people see it as like this is a normal way for you to react you know what I mean like this is a normal way of a man is is like perceive somebody as questioning the sexuality or everybody like relates more like they have they they find it more relatable The Rage or fear that a Benzino would feel about like oh everybody questioning their sexuality like it makes sense like oh y'all lying y'all this it's always this idea like people are always trying to paint this idea that like trans women are going around deceiving straight men and that's not true and that is often and what's and who who are the people that like reemphasized that are are are men who want to be perceived as straight who are embarrassed who are concerned about their sexuality and all of these different things y y y who go and then like put out this narrative that they're being lied to that all this is happening and then that's used to justify violence against trans women and I don't know yeah I I I feel like the most dishonest part of this whole conversation is that queer is a contagion that queer is actually that queerness is contagious um because it the argument just never holds up right like this Mythos that that people are going to catch the gay to um maris's Point ear or maris's Point earlier that like we're consuming so much straight heterosexual cisnormative content on a daily right most of the folks in our family are CIS hetero what is it like 7.6% of the population identifies as lgbtqi plus right um that's now that is up from like 10 years ago when it was around 3 to 4% and I think that's because people are feeling a little bit more comfortable to say who they are or to report who they are um but it is still such a small fraction of the population um so this idea that sexuality and there's and I I just did a video on it on my channel where I was talking about this whole booy thing and a lot of people were like oh I love you Herby but I'm going to be honest with you like you know young minds are impressionable and like people can you know it is contagious to some extent right and people was trying to get in they their pseudo scientific bag of me and I'm like well sister no if sexuality is contagious with the m with the amount of indoctrination that so many queer folks who live in a Christian Nation right have to or just a religious Nation have to consistently engage with why wouldn't we catch that form of that that form of sexuality that's easier to navigate life with right that would cause less friction less contention um so I don't think it's really a fear the more I think of it I'm like they know that that doesn't hold weight right it it doesn't take much to say one plus one is equaling 11 here I think the real fear is a fear of normalization because if these folks are normalized then that means me that I'll have to I'll have to accept them publicly because then I'll be condemned that's why everybody's like oh the gay community has so much power y'all say something people get canceled and it's like well well no that's what it is Comfort yeah I'm sorry yeah fear of comfort I would agree make a distinction when they talk about like Blackness as it relates to queerness too right because you have black people we are still black people right we're still experiencing like intersectionality is the thing we're still experiencing all these forms of Oppression interlocking and so it's like because this white gay man in New York who's rich is having you know his way that doesn't mean that all Queer people are having their way um and then I also think about like yeah like booy engaging with Zia Wade that way was crazy like that's a child and you're talking about her genitalia like that was so strange to me and then this coming kind of like full circle with his own child and like understanding the the the the violence I guess that he looks at clearness with particularly towards children is kind of been saying to me um like I can only because you know his daughter only spoken about this like once like she hasn't really been vocal about that and I can only really imagine well I think it's also goe yeah I mean I think it's go ahead well I just think it's really interesting like to your point Jay that like every time most of the times when we hear about boozy you know he does his little trolling on Twitter every now and again but it's always about his interest in a child's genitalia right it's always about his interest in a child's um sexuality or sexual activity or we're also hearing about him forcing a child to engage in sex acts with someone else like how getting a prostitute for your underage child that's sexual assault right and not only is it sexual assault you have compelled this child to engage in sexual activity in order to send a message about your own veril right so like that's a different type of sexual violence and SE sex trafficking that I don't think that we talk about and again children can't have sex children are molested right so and even when we talk this about Zia like this idea of her dick children don't have dicks and vaginas to me children have privates right like how are you how are you now ushering this language in and normalizing it but it just want to go back to what Ole was saying about this notion right of of this Panic that's coming out here I think it's important to note that like legally right the gay Panic defense which is a defense that's been here since the 1700s where you can say oh my God I didn't know it was a man I didn't know they were trans or I didn't know I was going to have sex with this person they and they were gay I was drunk you could kill them it's affirmative defense and it's only been ban in 17 states in the United States that's good law in 33 other states and so that means 54% of lgbtq people are living in states where the gay Panic defense is still good law right and so this idea that queer or non-binary or trans folk are out here trying to trick somebody straight usually the worst than bad anyway don't know what the hell they do doing right so selfish SCT men uh at the risk of being IL legally Legally killed right and not even murdered because murdered means it's a crime legally killed is nuts it's it's deeply diol cling lot of your homophobia not your but their homophobia in ch and safety of the child right like I hear this in the schools all the time it's the reason I didn't come out as a queer person for a long time especially stepping into education and even my students me of it because they were like well I don't want my parents say nothing crazy to you you're my favorite teacher and so like even kids see it right and so it's a negotiation that be had but I've heard it of everybody being like well when's the right time to teach this when do we allow this happen like it's a real thing that's very evident we see this every day in our communities yet there's something around when you are visibly queer right like I know I have the privilege of demonstrating as a masculine presenting person and so I know I navigate my queerness in a very different kind of way and so when I hear other people talk around like oh we're doing this for the kids we're saving the kids I'm like you don't actually care about kids you actually care about hiding this thing because you you have a personal disdain for it so don't hide it in the protection of children actually say the say your opinion out loud so we have the opportunity to negotiate how we want to interact with you in these ways and I think that's the piece for me that frustrates me because I'm like don't hide it in the safety of children or the innocent because a lot of our children's innocence is taken a very long time ago and you don't know how to handle it and so for me I always push back of just like is this in defense of children or is this in defense of your own homophobia that you don't know how to deal with when people are visibly queer and you want to prevent it because you want them to be men or you want them to be normal like stop playing people's faces so I did like what you said in terms of um children can't have sex they can uh how did you put that molested they're molested molested right so I'm going to go back to what Olay started with booy getting big kind of like the Tory Lan thing where he gets bigger after the crime or after the incident right I feel like we started hearing for me personally y'all can uh kind of enlighten me but I feel like booy started treading into the Waters of speaking on children after he was accepted on such a mass level for his thoughts on the lgbtq plus right so I didn't I don't feel like he he he baby stepped him his way into it he didn't just splash and immediately start talking about children the the um the don't cut your dick off thing that came a little bit later now I think he has but this is the thing he's still speaking for he was boosted up that is true because he's saying a lot of things that people are thinking whether that whether that majority of people be the ignorant the heterosexual or whatever like he's speaking the [ __ ] that nobody wants to say there's a lot of people who believe that right and they they might not comment but they might like his post they're following him like his followers are up it's one of those like silent things like uh when you become a new black you're a black conservative or Trump supporter like you might not like you gonna vote Trump in the booth but you're not about to be like maggot out in the middle of the street you know what I mean so he's gon to get that support because there are a lot of people and you were saying um that 7% of people Iden seven s% of people identify as some sort of like queer right or 15% around 15 like 15% which is a lot higher than the 3% which was 10 years ago correct yeah yeah so the marketing I'm going to call it I'll I'll say the marketing right people are more like comfortable with it now for a heterosexual person all okay for somebody who identifies as some um sexual identity outside of uh outside of heterosexual you've been bombarded with heterosexual things your whole life right watching TV or whatever but it's gotten so strong over the last let's just say the 10 years that all the heterosexual people are like what the [ __ ] I'm one of those people myself where in my mind growing up I didn't think nothing of a husband or wife on the screen right because to me that is normal right but to somebody else they might be like that's not the that's that's not how I see it or whatever so then over the last 10 years as you see any type of relationship displayed on screen there is a fear that a lot of people have whether that be a religious based fear an ignorant based fear or just a fear that of what they were told to believe and that they do believe at that point because they were told that in a direct or indirect way growing up via their parents uh social influence or whatever right so it's like seeing it on a mass level like that I can I can understand why people would think now now having that you might turn gay by watching it as an adult I think it's a little crazy right but I do I do think that we can all agree that like children are impressionable you can mold a child into a lot of things so for me personally I haven't done the studies on it I don't know if a child seeing more um uh more different types of lifestyle or sexual Lifestyles display on TV growing up will influence them towards that I have no idea I haven't done the research on it either because just Haven it you know it just it's not like something that I was like really concerned about but it is an easy thing for a heterosexual person to attach themselves to to not look as bad in the public to still get off their let's say toxic or homophobic uh thoughts or mindset you made a point about like 10 years of marketing I think the word marketing is strange but I think I know what you mean in terms of like advocacy maybe I no no no no I get I get where you're trying to go point that out but I think it's important to note that up until 2003 it was a felony for us to have gay sex and sex with between two men not between two women because that we know that appeals to straight people um but I think it's important to also note that case that case was called Lawrence vers Texas it was in Houston Texas Tyrone Garner black man even his name is not even on it and still got screwed but I'm saying this for purpose of intersectionality where Jay was at earlier Tyrone was had an ex-white boyfriend right allegedly he was in the house with another dude they were doing some drugs and the white boy called the police and he was mad he thought he was sleeping with the other white boy he wanted to own this black man he calls the police and says a black man just kicked in this apartment he's waving a gun right and so the police come and they kick in the door they arrest Tyrone and they arrest Mr Lawrence whatever his first name is the first officer comes in he says oh my God I caught them in the in the front room having anal sex the other Officer says well I saw them in the Liv in the bedroom they were having oral sex the third officer said there was no sex there was just marijuana right so I I I think it's important for us to note that this isn't just where sexuality where queer sex was legalized in this way but this is also the birthplace where we're really getting stronger Fourth Amendment protections that primarily protect black people right in our in our so-called right to privacy being reinvigorated after the 1960s right this is 2003 so I I think it's really important for straight black people to know one that as Jay was say earlier black queer people are always already dealing with anti-blackness and black anti-blackness is just another barri for us to carry and at the same time it's very often that queer black people black queer folks as I say check out the handle are are usually the ones that are carrying the community forward we can look at Marsha P Johnson and the right for sexual autonomy we can go back to William dorsy swan in 1860 a formerly enslaved what we call now a transgender person they said back then a drag who was the first person to say wait a minute black people deserve to have our own bodies and we have our sexual autonomy no straight black person was doing that in fact they were arrested they threw themselves down the stairs at the police house and officer kicked in their house in 1860 in DC they were sentenced to jail the judge said actually I wish I could sentence you to more than 10 years of hard labor so that people like you would not infect the good white and colored people of this Society so this idea of of qutis is Contagion has always already been a white supremacist ideal right and it's based in anti-blackness because it's been marked as even during slavery as a black perversion right so I think we need to be very clear about the history of this because it's not just homophobia because in reality when we're talking about homophobia against black people we're talking about black antiblackness because is still and this comes from white supremacist Christian Theocratic Frameworks and we got to be very clear about this now I I do can I just throw this in real quick I'm sorry to cut you off I'm so sorry but I do understand that but I will say that I feel like blackness is still Blackness but once it sounds different it doesn't sound like that to a heterosexual person when we're move when we think or when there's an organization it's supposed to be for Blackness but then there's a sub it feels like there's a subsection for alternative Lifestyles right so like if like Al yeah because is it isn't a lot of living alternative Lifestyles like aren't areally incarcerated living an alternative lifestyle and single dades that don't be with M alternative lifestyle like what if we we advocate for everybody that's very true now I will say before I continue to keep talking I'm trying to figure out how to say things the best way possible and not sound great yeah so like alternative lifestyle might have been the wrong thing to say but I don't know you know I don't want to say the lgbtq every time we could just say queer or gay queer that's easy all right so yeah so it's a black movement but then there's always a subsection of queer or there's a bunch of there's a bunch of who are down for a movement but they might not want to follow the queer person pushing the thing forward right because there's still that like what movement were you be sorry yeah because what movement are you talking about almost every we're talking about the Civil Rights Movement we're talking about the marshan Washington if we're talking about black lives matter these are headed by black queer folks I think like it seems like AJ homophobic a homophobic but we know that right I I like definitely for sure right but the thing is right like I understand what you're saying I understand how homophobia operates like I live with right but it is homophobic I think sometimes we think because something is a popular or even maybe it seems like the most popular so it becomes like the the average black opinion that we think that that lends Merit to it and I think that's the thing that we're disconnecting on because here's the thing right there's always groups of different kinds of black people right like within like black people if black people have a caucus black women have a group black men have a group like black immigrants have a group like black araban people have a group black Americans have a group and we don't have a problem with that so why does it become like oh I can't understand how this is black now all the the second that the caucus is black a you know what I'm saying like um and I think so and to building another thing we were saying earlier is I don't think it's that I don't like the children connection and the colle if for going back to like children in the in the gay community and this idea of like the contagion I don't think that it's that genuinely believe that the gay can be caught what I think people think can be caught is comfort with yourself you know what I mean because what I think the the thing that's important about children is to what to what AJ was saying is children can be is children are impressionable but more importantly not impressionable I think is that children can be forced to children are forced children are controlled by their parents and their Guardians to live in a particular way and mostly how you force children if you give children a complex when they're children and you make them feel like they can't live this way there's something wrong with this children are likely to believe that and they're less likely to be comfortable living that like as an adult so if you believe that homophobia if you fundamentally believe that that you're against uh the gay community you believe that people shouldn't be gay or people you know they are what you so what you're really saying is that you don't believe people should be comfortable openly out in being gay because it's not that we believe more people have become gay that gay is a contagion because the percentage is up it's that we believe more people because of a more Progressive Society that's showing and making you more comfortable and destigmatizing all these prejudices more people are comfortable like being open about their sexuality and that's the real problem the idea that like we can't force people and and it and it tracks everything sometimes it can be so frustrating with like how black people get about homophobia because we understand it in every other context like we understand when're like every other context when it's like all right we want y'all to be less like respectability politics we want you to pretend to be this way we want you to tap dance and be this way because we don't like it we are saying that that is less than we're ostracizing that and that is what that is even if it's common and normal to us in the black community but I also think sorry right so really quickly I Think You're a murderer if you do that like if you tell if you're creating and raising a black child or Eng engaging with your niece or nephew and you're telling them that this is not normal that's weird don't do that and you're compelling them to not have control over their own bodies as ol is getting at you know or you will know after this that black lgbtq children have the highest suicide rates in the whole nation you are participating in compelled euth in Asia you are killing black children and I think we need to be very very honest about that and if they don't die when they're five or six or seven like Nigel you all remember Nigel uh little eighty old boy that killed himself because of this type of idiology you you might be 17 or 25 or 34 dying of a meth overdose because you can't look yourself in the mirror because the voice of your mama your daddy your grandama your pastor are still telling you that you're an Abomination right but you are who you are in your beauti wonderfully made so I think we need to be honest that this isn't about opinion this is about either you're sustaining black life or you are snuffing it out and if you are snuffing it out you have a problem and you need to figure out what you're going to do about it period I think too um I have so many issues with so many of the ideas about impressionable children because I do think that children are persuadable right I think anybody who I think but I think that is also true about ill-informed misinformed educated adults um that I think that with a lack of information a lack of knowledge you are more persuadable right and I think that we're seeing a lot of infantile adults like booy giving these half-baked points that are rooted in nothing but fear-mongering and the nastiness of a lot of people's religious ideology or what have you and I do think it's important to just correct something that it is um 7.6% of the United States population identifies as lgbtq it's 17% of folks under 30 right and then that number increases as you move to different um age demographics but I think that that's important to not right that the number is highest amongst Young Folks because people then say well look see these young people are you know more gay or identifying as gay more so that means so that means that they are impressionable and I think that it's important to understand that people under the age of 30 were born what 95 and before do they even know about the laws that made it illegal for them to for in in the context of men having sex with men right do they even know about the laws that existed where they it was illegal for them to have sex with the person that they're attracted to and I also think back to the point of impressionable right I think that I grew up a Christian right black gay right um but I had friends who were Muslim I had friends who were um Buddhist right and so they I would listen to it because I I didn't know much about that so I'm persuadable on on that front um but at the end I'll come to a whole different um spirituality now but I think that folks people will give you information about whatever whatever it is that they're doing or you'll see them live that lifestyle if you are if that is something that like Sparks curiosity in you you'll inquire and if it's for you it's for you like people don't become gay they don't trip and fall on a dick it's like these things are you are who you are you're attracted to who you're attracted to it should be very that simple people are like I don't want my kid to find out that's the real fear you don't want your kid to find out or you don't want to in you don't want to create a context in which they feel safe enough to explore and maybe find out and it's not about sexual and this is the point that I really wanted to drive home because as a kid I didn't want to [ __ ] nobody at 7 but I did have a crush on Derek hey Derek um and so that wasn't that wasn't a matter of sexuality that's just attraction and to lie and say that kids aren't attracted to other people is to lie that you when you say little fat fat is kissing on um Litt mama and they both three years old with popsicles it's like girl but you understand these little kids are just they're just being kids and the point the reason why people can't get over the hypersexuality is because in the minds of so many people homosexuality equ equals hypersexuality right homosexuality equals hypersexuality in the minds of so many people and they don't see us beyond our sexual acts we become solely like that's like oh that's the sex Community that's the gender community so all they do is and if you add um grid right gay related uh imun before it was HIV it was a gay related disease and that's how it was marketed to people now that's the marketing that's the true marketing that's the homophobic marketing and propaganda that continually reduces queer folk to our genitalia our sexual acts and it's like girl yes we be but we do other [ __ ] too but I think that gets to like the larger piece right um because even if we bring it back to what booy was even saying largely in his comments as well he also talks around he doesn't want his sons to be less than men too so even adding on to this piece anymore even more it's this idea that queerness is inherently makes you less masculine and because of that this means that you don't know how to actually engage with your ol were you about say something it just you may you said something that made me think of something so interesting like when you pointed that out just now about he doesn't want his his sons to be less than men because you're right right that's the reason why he hired these these sex workers to molest his sons but what I find interesting is of talking about how like on one breath we equate uh homosexuality with hypersexuality and we use it as this reason to like fair and act like but at the same time we Define like masculinity like you're the real man if you're hypersexual like how many [ __ ] you out you oh if you could have a grown woman did in the next thing so it's like what the and then and then it's even like this idea that like queerness is relegated to submission as well and I think that's the other piece if we want to get into it because a lot of times even when [ __ ] find out that their kids are gay they be like so you like are you doing are you the one doing the bendon top top right sorry know sometime she did she I'm sorry but um to bring it back in all reality I think it is also like super important to name like as we he continues to have this conversation and some of the reactions I was seeing from this conversation were a lot of black people going well it's his house his rules because he keeps going well she's grown so I don't want him to bring it around for this right and so I think a lot of where the frustration ends up happening I said now I think it's stupid but I can see their I can track their thinking um is that a lot of them are seeing this as if you were bringing this around this is my house my rules you can keep that over there and keep that quiet over to where you do it because you're grown and so to see black people be like well that's the way he wants to raise his kids and now they're going with well this is a black man who is raising his kids he gets to do it however he wants we shouldn't be policing a black father on how he's raising kids don't ask don't tell that's what I was saying again the comfort thing like I know you're gay the reality is that we know no matter how H [ __ ] you you know that there are gay people you know that you know this isn't about like you just genuinely believe they should have to live in secret you think that's okay you think that's right and you find these other justifications to like reinforce it oh it's my house it's my this it's this lifestyle oh I don't agree with it blah blah blah blah blah and I find it so interesting right is like when it sexual orientation to me is the only group where we think like agree like we start talking about Lifestyles and all this because like if I saw somebody like and I've talked about this before like there's so many groups and classes and all these things that we belong to in society like there's so many things that are true and I don't you don't go and you don't see a Muslim and you and you don't go well I don't agree with you know what I mean and and that does and you don't then get allowed to like start like berating them and blah blah blah like that's not how we get to operate with any I don't like see poor people I don't agree with that like I don't agree with your lifestyle as a broky what like um let's disc we see that girl now come on Jay speak speak up baby you a little quiet oh my fault I don't got a mic um but something you you know all to your point and something that Herby said right like it's we understand that queer people exist we understand that they're in the world you just don't want your child to be gay you just don't want that to be attached to you and um Maris was saying earlier right like it's interesting that karisha was the one having this conversation because you know I remember the video where karisha was talking about how you know she don't have a problem with gay people her best friend is gay but she would beat her son ass if he was gay or something to that effect and I was so we were rooting for you you know what I mean like I was so confused I was like wait a minute you hang out with Santana every day you get your nails done and hair done and are in a daily basis you know what I'm saying like engaging with people but you have this visal reaction to it if that was you know your your child and and and again I don't really know where I don't really understand that but that makes me think of like what AJ was saying earlier I'd wanted it just reminded me like what I'd wanted to respond when AJ was saying um that you know just because like obviously like booie speaks to like with the the thought process of a bunch of people even if they're not commenting it and I was like I want to push back on the idea that they're not commenting it like I'm like you know sometimes like like like in an oay and friend ecosystem like we seem like the majority but we're not like on our internet ecosystem we're not at all like a barers sh please like speaking of like like I'm like first of all in real Society especially the fact that people feel comfortable they feel most comfortable doing this when it's children because they like they get to hide it under the cloak of their kids and I'm protecting them and all these other things and so that is or religion that or and religion so we're hearing that people are hearing that all day every day like I hear like I hear a [ __ ] T of homophobia like when I just go out into the world of listening I actually literally just text my best friend when I was getting my pixie cut my my hair stylist is a Jamaican lady and I was like and um two gay black guys walked in to ask about a hairstyle and the minute they like the minute they walked in the two black Jamaican ladies looked at me instant like know of like this to be the knowing homophobia and I was like I texted my white Bassy and I was like you know how white people just assume you're going to be racist like it's a comfortable environment to be racist with you that's how like other black people deal with you with like we're all with it right and I'm just like uh and speaking of the and Saucy Sana like I I was actually just looking at this this weekend because Saucy Sana is UN Ling hip hop and I watch all the love and hip hop stuff on YouTube and every time sashy be in a scene breathing and the comments are just like I hate him with that beard and this this I was like I was actually like oh [ __ ] I realized how like Progressive i' made my circle when I was like like slapped back by the level of like just hatred F in the comments just breath in like the way they were so like offended by the concept of a non-binary person and I'm like I think we have to remember that that actually is what I think a lot like people are it's the major the world is not this progress like we we act like the world has become like Progressive and nice and soft and politically correct and it hasn't well I want to on the majority thing though I don't think that that's true like I'm I live in Kansas City but I'm from Royal Kansas we had a lot of queer folk around us and people weren't homophobic it's a town of 7,000 people that I grew up in it was majority white maybe 15% black and people weren't concerned about who you were they were concerned about now and this is I think where we're really talking about it's not sexuality it's gender presentation right and so I think that there's a difference there and so I think we have this thing where we promote particularly on Rural people particularly on country Black Folk this notion of homophobia this notion of ignorance but often times those are the most PE the people that are mind their own damn business and they don't give a damn Longs you're not harm in nobody so I don't want to put that on us and I think most polls have shown that black people are actually among the least homophobic in the country by race and I think what happens and you see this with Trump supporters too where they go around and they act like they're a silent majority and no one ever checks that [ __ ] you're not you're allow minority and that's the reality but I think that also there's a thing that's happening around here and O you made me think about this you talked about you know the ways in which people are able to exist publicly don't ask don't tell right uh it's kind of like that you get that penalty once you make me aware make me know even though I already know make me publicly know your sexuality we have a system in this country in many ways of sexual apartheid right and we're fine right with queer people a lot of times to O's Point as long as they're over there they're not around us but even when you bring this back to JT's point the point about uh home girl from uh city girls right you think about it for a lot of these yeah Kisha my bad when you when you think about a lot lot of these homophobic uh celebrities in women in general black women in general it's really interesting because a lot of them their whole life is structured by career people it's interesting that you can be homophobic but you could never exist without career people right and that isn't to say that there isn't a a reciprocal ecosystem between queer non- women right and sis head women right we get a lot of culture from each other but the reality is a lot of The Taste making a lot of the dresses you wear a lot of even the arguments that have been made in court about gender autonomy have been made first and foremost by cre people they exist I think as Jay was saying earlier as the canary and the coal mine for the progression of Rights and so God damn it if there was not queer people there may not be a you today and I think we have to be very very clear about that I think oh I'm going let you talk Maris I was just going to uh clarify something I think when I um talking about like black people and like I I don't think like obviously black people in America are statistically are not the most homophobic or anything I've always statistically we always come out most Progressive in America I was raised in the Caribbean like born and raised in the Bahamas so when I think of my first my like I think my first and my largest like output of black people I'm thinking about Caribbean black people and I'm here to say we are exceptionally homophobic like like I swear I swear to my God we're cripplingly homophobic I go home to it's bad okay it's bad like it's in it's insane like it's so homophobic I'd be like Jesus Christ how are y'all even managing to be this homophobic with no gay people around right now like what is it that's how bad it be like so that's what I yeah but I think that gets to the larger points um because something I was thinking around is especially when doc was talking it's that folks don't know what to do when the culture shifts because people always go between tradition versus um Innovation progression whatever that thing looks like and so once you are made aware of the thing you are now accountable to change I think a lot of people don't want to be accountable to that change because if I get to operate in this default that's all I know because what I'm also think about are some of the families who don't know what to do right and so some of the intent can be like N I see some people who live harder lives fundamentally when they are able to be openly themselves and this is some of the stuff I had to like talk parents through as well is like you need to find a balance of what safety looks like I said we're talking about black kids I'm here in Philly like they're black kids everywhere and so even walking out and doing that but having that intersection some parent I'm not saying all parents do it some parents genuinely do I've witnessed parents want to learn like I don't know how to fundamentally raise my child right and so I'm thinking now even from like because I'm also not giving them the outs either but when you are met with parents who want to try and figure out like what does this mean to affirm my queer child what does it mean to allow them to exist outside of this um hypersexualization of um queer folks it is like I don't know how to protect my child so the only way I know how to protect my child is just saying you need to mask up in order to straight in order to survive longer than what it is right you need to F it up in order to survive because we all know the we all know the lesbians our Butch our Butch Queens who are on the corners and we just ignore them every day but we know but they the home girls right but I think it's particularly interesting as we talk around like the raising of children when we talk around how we need to move and navigate in a way that's healthy because I remember the first time I've witnessed homophobia and I love my great aunt I love her to death but she called out my older brother and was just like oh that baby wasn't raised right and that's because he he walked so I could run okay in terms of um being openly queer right and so when I heard that I was like oh y'all really think it is around how people are raised that is equating to somebody's sexual orientation and so sitting there and realizing like even watching a family member who I love to death but hearing that at the age of like 12 13 I said oh something's wrong right and so I had to unlearn that very quick well not quickly it took me a couple years Shadow therapy whatever but um it was one of those moments where I had realized I said y'all have really convinced yourself that raising a child right and a successful child means that they are straight and they are quote unquote normal but in reality that's not the case the reality is you don't know you don't have the tools to know how to raise your child for the world that they are going to grow up in and who's and something I struggle with as an educator is when do I step in to be like actually I can give you the tools I'm not telling you how to parent but I can give you the tools to show up for your child better if that makes sense so that's something I still like am processing and struggle with but I see that tension happening that give a good question that makes me want to ask the group like I want to ask the room because it makes me think especially when you say our like desire to like I want the children to seem normal because I think that shows up in different ways like in a case like my little brothers are have are autistic right they and there's a way like my family is always talk about like oh them being normal right like make them normal the idea of like you're trying to help them be normal be normal be normal you know and it makes me and hearing you talk about um survival like them thinking that the way to to have these children survive is to like have them hide and I see that like think in the same context of how we do that with LGBT te children we do it the same way with like that my little brothers are not the only kids in my family who are on the spectrum they are just some of the only kids who we can get someone to admit they're on the Spectrum you know what I mean and there's so many kids in my family and we're not my family not good on like my immediate family unit but my brothers L our light years ahead of the rest of the family and still very much so far behind the times in in in accepting accepting that right is this this attitude that that it it's harming the children to admit what what what like to call to call it what it is to call a thing what it is like for them to be normal for them to be able to survive this life is to seem normal and to be normal is to not like admit or to be a part of any of these groups and it makes me think like when I was listening like there is some level you know if you take out like what is inherent like the real hate motivated homophobia there is some I'm I'm sure there are people because I feel like I I can remember feeling like this as a like in college like oh maybe like it would I wouldn't want my kid to be gay because that would be more problems for them that's an even harder life for them right can you blame a parent for trying to protect their child by that's what I'm about to say is can we change what I want to ask the group is are we able to change some of like this homophobia and this treatment of of how we are treating like children in our community if we change this idea of what is needed for survival because I think like a lot of parents especially a lot of black parents think of like always want to make life harder for their children this idea like on some level like this idea making life hard is to prepare you for the world out there right like survival but what I've think my life experience has been is that a lot of the hardest [ __ ] that everybody I know seems to be going through are the psychological demons and barriers that they have that only them could see from their like lives and how they've been raised and all these different things and I'm like could we have even if like forget like changing the the inherent your whole heart on homophobia could we have like parents having better relationships with their children and being better to their aquired children if they change their idea of what they need to survive is like it would be better for those children to survive if you would accept this world affirm them and make a safe space for them rather than think you need to make them suppress it is that possible that's what I wanted to put to the WR I I think that that's difficult to do because I feel like there's multiple piece it's like multi-prong right like there's the idea that I'mma whoop your ass before the police do right like in the black community specifically right like that if I do harm to you you'll understand what harm feels like and so you'll try to avoid harm at all at all costs right and there's also this idea that like okay we can't even speak about it right because power of life and death lies in the tongue right so if I give life to this queer identity then maybe you'll walk in it fully and even if I come to accept it people I'm going to I'm going to give these people the benefit of the doubt and say that they understand the world is homophobic and that they're they're trying to be good parents and they want to make sure that their kids are safe moving to the world and so there's this idea like in I I almost got like baby emotional right shed a thug tear when Maris was talking about how his brother who I'm assuming is more queer presenting than you are um walked Ran So they walk so you can run walk so you can run I mess up that quote every time it's okay I'm like what but um so yeah of myself and my siblings like everybody's queer right um but I came out and there's four of us but I came out before all of them because I'm a flaming um and so my it just is what it is right um and so my parents are Haitian and Jamaican and that was a very interesting experience um growing up but here's the thing it when you brought up like people just love that yeah but but see of them I'm I'm the most you wouldn't be able to clock really anybody's tea unless they told you um like you you well you can clock my tea um and so I always come back to this idea of how prevalent fem phobia is in the in larger society right because it's not exclusive to queer folk people hate women and people hate them presenting people in general that's inter it's interlocked right with misogyny and homophobia and always come back to this question of like how important is masculinity really right when when they're saying like I want to protect you so you have to be masculine move to the world masculine so that you are safer but I'm like what is the utility of masculinity right like what has M masculinity has brought us great things right but you know masculine men have also brought us War imperialism Manifest Destiny white supremacy um so poor Dad sorry it's not it's not called masculinism right it's called feminism and so I think that the the whole this practice of like move through life in masculine way and you'll be safer I mean I think that it should be I think that what we should be trying to do is disconnect this idea so for me obviously I grew up religious as well so there's this interlocking of like this idea of like power of life and death lives in the tongue so I'm going to speak this life into this idea that you are queer and so therefore you will be queer one I give you a$ thousand dollar if you show me one scripture in the Bible where Jesus was condemning homosexuality I wa um two I think that um if we can disconnect these two Notions of um like the spiritual this idea like I'mma whoop your ass for the police do disconnecting all of these things and just see that like this is who you are this is who you will be um so I'll be honest with you like I grew up in in the hood so it had to give just don't let Play Don't Let [ __ ] play with you um so feminine or not you got to be able to get in the paint if somebody plays in your face and so for me what's what's most important is you have to teach your kids to be able to defend you don't change right you just meet people where they are and if and if they don't have if they don't see it for you well you meet them paint if you got to um and then you move on as who you are because at the end of the day you have to your identity is all you got um so I think if I would have had parents who who reminded me that there is strength in standing on business I did it on my own they didn't have to teach me um but it would have been it would have been much more tender I we would have had a much better relationship if they told me like I support you I stand with you and if parents teach their kids like I'm standing behind you we support you but you also can't let nobody play with you outside and you know what I'm saying in the outside world but that's why they demonized Dwayne Wade right that's the same way they that's why they do that because they're just like oh you can't show up this way because does this make you look like a better father than me does this make it seem like you've unlocked the path to something else or is this a question on your own sexuality right and so I think that's also very interesting piece on when support and healthy support and what it should look like begins to show up now everybody suddenly has an issue with seeing a present black father and I'm like what do y'all want cuz at this point you're like you want black fatherhood you want that representation you have somebody here but you're like but not like that and so that was like the quick point that I was thinking around as we got into that yeah one last thing on the force piece because I feel like um I am a pacifist like I don't be fighting um but what I am saying but in the words of needy we can we can um but what I'm saying the reason why I bring up violence is because queer folks are we're being met with so much violence always have right but in terms of hate crime according to the FBI what three uh uh one in every five uh hate crimes have been motivated by lgbtq or anti-lgbtq bias right and that's as of 2023 right so there's there after race after uh ethnicity and religion it's queerness that are the most uh are we are the victims of hate crime the most right and those are violent crimes it's not just legislative well it is legislative right with over 530 bills um in legislation across the uh excuse me over 530 bills being introduced in state Le legislatures across the United States right so there is a legislative battle that we're being forced with but I think the violence um and the whole idea of like don't don't let play in your faith face is important because people want to meet you with violence right so you have to be it's not about being it's I'm saying you you don't have to be on you don't have to operate on the offense but you do need to be ready to operate on the defense unfortunately well I I think that like so one I just want to clarify that data really quickly because it's important to know the data is right that you said but it's important to note that when it comes to the doj hate crimes data or FBI hate crimes data you're only allowed to Q's one category right so if someone is assaulted because they're black and queer it goes into one of the buckets it doesn't go into both so that I say that to say that that number for lgbtq people is deeply deflated right but I I think that too I think we have to get at the fact that like we have a crisis in the black community that has emanated From Slavery right and I think that Herby said it perfectly right and my grandmother says it differently she says you know we beat you so the police don't kill you right and so this idea that we inur you to harm so you know how to act uh one of my favorite professors Christina sharp calls it the violent lessons of comportment right how do you act so you do not die and we have this emphasis from black people from slavery to the present on survival and not on living not on thriving but merely existing and surviving and if our frame for the best life is survival we never get to the full appreciation and value around freedom and so I think that is why and people you know this is controversial for black folks but I don't give a the data is very clear right when you spank your kids it creates Dark Matter on the brain it closes their amydala it makes them act in particular types of ways and it also up their language acquisition and their ability to do math and science that is child abuse but we say well I have to teach them how to act I have to be a good parent I'm a strong disciplinarian and and quite frankly that disciplinarity that we that we brag about we call it love it's not love it might be care maybe right but it's not love this is a Reen action of the overseer on the plantation over and over and over again and this has always been the debate within the black community on those slave ships we have black folks that said you know what I'd rather have my freedom at the bottom of the sea than survive on the other side of these chains and that has always been our debate so I think as black people we have to be very clear that a lot of the things that we do that we're doing to our children is one is because we do not see them as human we see them as property and also because we have not fully saw ourselves as human we still see ourselves as the property of the state and property of white society which is why we we we Whip and we lash ourselves with these violent lessons of comportment of how do we style our hair when we go to work yeah how do we code switch how do we get this job and we police other black folk that come in after us so I think we have to be CLE about the ways in which we reenact the plantation and we call it love it's sick it's Sinister and it's s it's sadism right but at the end of the day we have to be real that love frees love does not bind care might have you locked up in solitary confinement so we need to be clear about those differences because are you freeing this child or are you setting them up for a drug addiction suicide brain damage whatever else and we're not clear with ourselves about it and we're not clear about our parent just one second and we're not clear about the ways in which like our parents have abused us right and because if we're clear about that then that ruptures the most love the most loving relationship that we believe we've had and it also destabilizes our relationships and now we must be see ourselves as child abusers and I think psychically we're not prepared to deal with the fact that we've harmed the most vulnerable loving and beautiful folks in our lives and those are children yeah B Hook's All About Love okay I was I was just to plug it what you was going to ask I about to say I was about to ask is there like a model like is there an example of how to change because then everything is coming back to how pre presenting is kind of a bigger issue the acceptance how we're even raising our families do is there even a model because it's like I hear a lot of there's a lot of trauma that black people are like incurring over and over on each other right just outside of being queer or whatever so but is there any sort of model because that you're talking about changing like a whole thing like we have to consider religion we have to consider all those things like yeah I think to be just to be succinct to like Olay just gave the answer you can read B hooks All About Love Trilogy you can read imman Perry's breathe letter to her sons and there's so many TED talks on the ways in which black folks have changed and evolved on how they engage with their children and I mean Step One is how do you just see your child as a human an autonomous being that needs you to gently converse with them and guide them through societ like right now I just had to take custody of my my young toddler nephew and I have to catch myself with even I get frustrated like why am I yelling at this child right like the child ain't do nothing to be a child right I'm the one who's impatient I need to yell at me and so it's really thinking about like what is my emotional health and number one are you in therapy because how much of the stuff that you're doing you don't even mean to do you doing it because your mama and grandama them did it to you right so I think there are a lot of models and I'll put some links in the chat uh so you can check them out as well also a big change I think too like it the very simple thing to do is to ask yourself as a parent as a loved one as an as a hopeful Ally um um or just as someone who says that you love the people in your life who are queer is to ask yourself what does it mean to love this person what does it mean to love anyone and I love that we brought up Bell hooks All About Love because she does make a a clear distinction between what love is and what cathexis is and I know a lot of people are not with that term but it's just this there there's a clear people confuse the two things without even knowing maybe what the term is like love as B Hook defines it is the will to or like uh to nurture one's own or another's spiritual or emotional growth so if you're not a spiritual person then maybe just believe that I'm here I we exist and in this reciprocal relationship where I want to see you grow and and just live your best life right I want I want to see you happy I want to see you fulfilled right love fulfills it does not deplete and I think if you ask ask yourself the question if you interrogate what it means when you say I love you right then you cannot you will come to the realization that you cannot love and also abuse right um those two things are um diametrically opposed right they they they do not they are they don't live in the same world um I also think that uh well also this idea this this idea of cathexis is just I this is just this notion that um we emotionally bond with a person or an idea or a thing right and so people feel like oh because I've spent this right because I've made this investment I made an emotional investment in this person I care about this person that that's the end of loving but I would venture to say that that's just the very beginning of loving right you there there's so much more to it so I think first asking yourself the question what does it mean to love your child and if you come up on an answer that says I can love them and hate them at the same time that I can juggle this idea that I hate homosexuality but I love my child that you might you might need to get back in the booth [ __ ] and I also want to um before we go um read booy's apology to his daughter um he said uh I said some things and I didn't know it'll hurt you your daddy truly sorry and I hope you can forgive me um live in your truth and just know that you'll always be my baby no matter what except my apology this is what got me Daddy could have said it in a in a better way you my baby and and it'll always be that so you so this idea that it's a contagion this idea that I don't want you around to contaminate my children still exists and and so but but but with hard eyes and I could have said people were in the comments like oh he could have said influence he could have said and it's like I don't know I can't I can't I can't battle with you girls who don't want to see reason because a lot of people are like oh well like you're so book smart you can't see Common Sense kids are impressionable and I'm like no you're so stupid you can't see common sense because the common sense the common sense is that the same way that queerness was not contagious enough for her to catch for for straightness was not contagious enough for her to catch it queerness is not contagious enough for them to catch it that's the basic logic of it all I just want to share a resource I just want to share a resource real quick so you as for I put like eight links in the chat but the one I think is probably most important is called um it's WR is created by a black woman mother uh parenting decolonized the website has a lot of resources on what you can do how do you change what what information do you need and also the podcast releases episodes for step-by-step ways how to change and shift parenting behaviors reactions and even paradigms so I would definitely for everyone that's watching this and also for you AJ and anyone that maybe you're not a parent maybe you're an uncle you're an auntie you're a non-binary auntie whatever you might be like you should all check this out because we don't want to we want to make sure we're not harming the Next Generation and the children that come next we got to figure out how to make a lot of you know a lot of people don't read you know what I'm saying I was gonna baby just listen do best to meet like I do my end my Endeavor best to meet everybody where they're at right like I'm doing all the things doing everything that I can something I am I I will just say we gota stop stealing with black people like we are like we are in some way unable you know what I mean like we like I feel like whenever I'm trying like we try have conversations about like what the black community need to address issues in the black community is this energy of like everybody wanting you to treat black people like we have no ability to like change learn something new do something different help ourselves and and I understand like I I really get that especi especially when we're talking like about patriarchy like when we have those conversations like how overwhelming that can feel like these larger systems when we're talking about like these bigger systems the whole Community is like invested in and believes in how hard that is to unlearn that and get us to like build something new I I get that but when it comes to like the topic of children when people do this that is actually one of the few times we're talking about some [ __ ] you could start at home like you know what I mean where you can literally like you can affect and change this just based on the way that you decide to learn and show up and parent the children and the families that you create that cannot be above you like that it cannot be Beyond you to learn how to be like a better parent if you don't think it's beyond you to be a parent you know what I mean to like continue to do that right and um we also have a lot of ir we have a lot of irresponsible parents too though we do and so something I was gonna say um and B hooks talks about this a lot I think a lot of the reasons why um black people are so there's so much resistance like to dis like when we want to talk about like why we shouldn't beat our kids why we shouldn't deal with this like aggressive authoritarian discipl disciplinarian like way of parenting and a lot of it or and how much like upset people get when you say that's not love or it's not good is because that's what a lot of us have experienced and it's scar like not just like people feeling like worried about what it means about them as a parent but worse people feeling like it would call into question the relationships they have with their own parents you know what I mean and with their children and so many of us have been raised in our homes where our parents have done things to us that are not a reflection of love that are not kind that are not good but they tell us and we tell ourselves in turn that they love us they are doing everything in their best interest that this is all of this and we've told ourselves that and a lot of people are not like willing to reconcile what it what it might mean like what they might mean when they revisit their childhood and these things with this new information and I get that that's difficult and I get that that's tough but it cannot be Beyond you to do it like I really think like in the case I get it with some other things I feel like sometimes I understand I'm handing lofty [ __ ] at people but I really really am getting tired of black people willingly having children willingly having children and then anytime you want to talk about being a good parent it's like oh my God I'm busy I'm busy with the day but that's but that I think that'll get to the point though as well because I was like I don't like when begin to infantilize booy and like booy as well as if they're I said don't J colas you you know how to read don't do that but um however I think it is also getting to the point of like how are we meeting people where they are at especially AJ as I think around your question it's something we get a lot because I feel like think that being gay is like this intellectual exercise and gymnastics that we have to go through in terms of like how to make sense of it no do you have human decency not I would say oh yeah go ahead go ahead no you're good um but I would say that I know when I talk to the on the St I don't think people want to inherently do wrong I don't think people inherently want to be bad right however people have to be humble of humble enough to know how to learn I think that goes to the point I was making earlier is like when you are met with new information you have no choice but to change right that's what learning is right and now it is a and now it becomes a question of like where's your moral code what are your ethics because I walk past the [ __ ] on the stoop all the time they know who I am they know about me I don't feel the need to have to protect myself again I have the privilege to walk around like that I'm 62 and 240 very different world that I get to navigate through right however you said what I said a you got hands probably and I and I do so don't sleep don't sleep on the fighting FS don't sleep oner but um okay never fighting fils is crazy it's a superhero no for real like in Atlanta I watch out for the girls cuz the girls they will beat your ass they got pepper spray they got razors they got they got hands and heels you got to run please please with the alliterations it's too much um but AJ I would say uh when you think around like I cuz for me I I have friends across the Spectrum and it's the everyday challenges you present to your friends right the people in your immediate circle the people in your neighborhood those people who are your immediate community on Twitter don't give a [ __ ] they're not going to know about me because they're not in community with me because it's parasocial relationships however how many people have you personally been able to challenge like well why do you think this way do you not have human decency because we can agree to disagree but what James Balwin say if it's um disregarded my Humanity then there there's no space that we're going to disagree on that Humanity right and so we begin to ask those questions more and more because the more you ask why three four five times start to stumble over their words and then they're just like oh I'm the [ __ ] right and so if your politic is rooted in human decency then you have no choice but to be able to acknowledge people where they are at do I particularly always want to hang around people who are ignorant as no I don't because I don't like dumb people however do I know how to have human and immediately okay but um for me I think it is important to know at least if you're in community and you know you have a privilege over somebody else and you know and you know better then you encourage people around you to do that because at the end of the day what a lot of men do are looking for permission to know how to move about a lot of [ __ ] and so as long as we are able to just model what this thing looks like especially for straight men to model what a healthy sense of self looks like because that's what it really it is your in own insecurities but also being able to advocate for somebody else so many other fall in line if they think that you are the that is deemed to be right or the most powerful in the space that they occupy and so it is a challenge of other men to be able to um one understand the privilege that they have two be able to engage in a genuine conversation with those who are in actual community and then three on top of that is to challenge those Notions and understand like dog if you're not going to get this right I can't be in community with you because often times we go let that [ __ ] go but we don't challenge or have a consequence that makes sense because then that talks around your own moral code too and that's to because we just want to be around our friends we don't have to negotiate that but you do have to be able to know are you for self or you for Community you that you answer that question that's where your decency lies in my boat two quick things like I think that like we cannot underestimate yeah just because this you a for don't run I think it's well hear it yeah I think it's important I think it's important to remember the amazing in capacity of black people to not only change themselves but to change the world the modern world that we know has been built not just only off of black labor both compensated and uncompensated but black genius and black ability to evolve and create revolutions across the globe so I think that when we think about what we've been able to do collectively that is the collective additive efforts of black individuals right and so when we talk about this I mean going back to Bel hook she said you know I put it in the chat the will to change men masculinity and love the question question is right are you as an individual adding to the sustenance of black life right or are you taking away from it because you're doing one or you're doing the other and you have to just do that internal work to unbecome the harmful parts of you and the last thing to add on to maris's point like right we cut off for all type of [ __ ] like let's be honest there's a lot of people you don't with no more and you have to decide which more which moral things are are arise to that level and this should be one of them right you choose that oh wait I did want to say too because everybody so this my last Point hold on hold on holiday um some can't be saved and we not talking to y'all I just want to end this [ __ ] by saying y'all biggy I'm really waiting for Aon to be like and beat Biggie and beep you and beep I'm not signing on to the black disposability I'm not on it he
