Of course that can't be right because at root the power of a class over others rests on the state power. If you are culturally resisting them and living alternatively in a way that disrupts their ability to make profits; if culture or propaganda can't get you back in place...then here comes the police and security services.

So if the choice is musical quality vs profits of course music quality is going to be sacrificed. You could make the best song ever if it doesn’t sell you will be outcompeted. Unless you think profit = good music. But then you can’t say popular music is shit because it makes insane profits.",

        "text": "@FakeSchrodingersCat The issue with Marxism is that in every single circumstance that it's been tried, and the idea of collectivism dehumanizes the entire society. \n\nAs such, there have been genocides, famines, as well as a tattletale culture that leaves everyone untrustworthy of one another out of fear.\n\nNazis were mass murdering psychopaths, but so are communist leaders.\n\nThere's a very good reason people escape communist countries, and people who grow up in communist/former communist countries are extremely opposed to communism because they've already lived in that hell. That's not a coincidence, either. Over the last century, there have been dozens of failed communist countries, and in every single circumstance, it has caused widespread suffering on the population.\n\nThis leads me to that second point - collectivism. Collectivism, in essence, means that the group, party, or idea, should come first. Before the individual good, or individual rights, to be specific. This was very much a thing before the Renaissance in the 16th century, as well as the Industrialization of the world. The \"peasant\" class, which was nearly everyone, were disposable cannon fodder for the upper castes of society. The lives of the poor mattered little to the leaders, generally.\n\nNow, both communism and Nazism practiced collectivism, as it strips away individual identity and individual rights in favor for adherence to an ideology, and bowing before a large, totalitarian government. Why is this bad? \n\n\"The common good should come before the individual good.\" - Adolf Hitler\n\nThis evil message connects perfectly with collectivism, and we're even seeing it today. Collectivism, in Essence, says the common good should come before your individual well-being, and as the government has the say over what is \"good\" or not,  the people, who have very little power, are mere pawns on a chess board, and the government decides who gets to live or die. \n\nIn turn, this dehumanizes all of society, as their individual right to live, as it conflicts with the \"party\" and their belief that your well-being is in opposition to their \"greater good\".\n\nAnd for further knowledge, feel free to listen to former KGB Agent Yuri Bezmenov (or however you spell it) talk about the Marxist subversion through indoctrination through education by manipulating how people think.",

Russia might have started out as a communist revolution but that died very quickly as the Bolsheviks murdered all opposition who threatened their power, after which they were not communist or socialists or even collectivists they were simply another totalitarian state that happened to use the window dressing of Marx rather then Capitalism or Nietzsche or Christianity or Hereditary right to justify their rule.\r\n\r\nAs for collectivism my idea of what that means is not an imposed state where if you mess up I am also punished for it, that is not collectivism even if the Soviets and Nazis decided to use that label.  Collectivism as described by Marx is the model of the trade union where people agree to collectively work together to bargain for fair and equal wages and working conditions.  Or when a group of farmers collectively agree to pool their labor and harvests.  Or the shops where rent is split and tools are shared so that each craftman does not need to duplicate every item and expense.  The main thing is it is voluntary and it a collective pooling of resources and risks not blame and punishment.\r\n\r\nThe problem is you are taking a very specific corruption of these terms and then assuming that the corruption was actually the desired result.  Marx would have been absolutely livid that the Soviets or Chinese or North Koreans call themselves communists because they break every specific point not to mention the very spirit of his ideals.",

And of course he was persecuted and his work too. The Prussian conservatives did everything they could to keep him silent, which tells us everything.  Deported and constantly moved all from Brussels to France back to Germany, he found finally peace in the UK, all in a span of 1844 to 1850 .

You can't successfully take down oppressive systems of government without intersectionality, otherwise all of your plans will just fall apart on themselves. Also Marx did acknowledge that slavery became a thing in western societies because of capitalism. Back then, that was considered as a super pc talking point. Now of course that SHOULD be common sense, frankly not very many ppl caught on to that other than black socialist activists like MLK, Malcolm X and W.E. Du Boise. Marx was a racist himself though, but anyway, yeah, pc culture needs to stop being so heavily criticized as being nonsensical, because it really isn't. Also I'm not a marxist really. I consider myself to be libertarian socialist or an Anarchist if you will. Anarchism unfortunately has anti-Semitic roots, but most Anarchists today have abandon those roots in favor of promoting horizontal power structures, overthrowing capitalism, the state, and all unjust hierarchy and etc. We just don't blame everything on jews anymore, good riddance.",

In order to show they are better thinkers, they complicate matters and import unnecessary complex terms. In a toxic mix, this can lead to pseudo-religious crusade which masks deep selfishness, hatred for difference and hatred of non-conformity. Marxism is a perfect mix of toxic influences. Every idea in Marxism has been falsified - from the agricultural revolution creating what later became states to the laughable labour theory of value -  and yet it survives. Massive state subsidies, particularly in education, have given this most cancerous ideology in human history a boost. To survive, the west needs to strictly control funding of universities and stop state control of education.

(where he departed fom christianity is that he belived humans can save themselves, while christians have the humility to know that isnt possibly, only god(if he exits) can do that.) marx also saw himself continuing the french revolution.\nthe final conclusion is that marxism is an ideology that could only have originated in western civ.\n\nthat means that the cold war was a quarrel between to western ideologies, and not a quarrel between east and west. \nalthough russia was not a western power, it was taken over people who wanted to westernize on the marxist model and created the soviet union. same with china, north korea, vietnam, cambodia etc. they were not western nations but ruled by a western ideology. \nthat in turn means that two western ideologies, nazism and communism, were behind the some of the worst atrocities in human history.",

But with respect, the 'Peterson likes Nietzsche, Nazis likes Nietzsche, Peterson likes Nazis' point is incredibly weak and shows your lack of understanding of both Nietzsche's and Peterson's ideas. The idea that Nietzsche's philosophy provides a foundation for Nazism was debunked a long, long time ago. His ideas were deliberately misrepresented, selectively edited and not released in their totality by his sister after he went mad, to suit her political ideology. Go ask ANY philosophy professor if liking Nietzsche's ideas justifiably merits comparisons to the Nazis and see what they say.\n\nAlso, if he's an unconscious Nazi, why would he have Soviet propaganda on his wall? He would have Nazi stuff up there, wouldn't he? And yes, if he did have Nazi stuff it would raise a lot more eyebrows, but only because of the differences between Nazi and communist ideology. We don't see an Antifa member waving a hammer and sickle flag and call it a hate symbol, do we?

He feels that the totalitarian instinct is never far away and believes we have to watch others and ourselves to keep it at bay. Regarding his childhood he may be the first to acknowledge some of what you say, but I don't think his experiences led to a desire for power and domination, especially since his current success doesn't put him in an alpha-male position where he gets all the chicks, he just has bigger lectures and does interviews on TV.\n\nIn conclusion, my reading of his views is that the human being has a wild horse inside them which they must harness and tame. If this is done successfully its strength can take us to great places, but if not it could lead us to destruction.\n\nGood Will Hunting is a great film.

It speaks a lot to the sentiments at the time among locals regarding the value of old Chinese cultural artifacts and teachings that these two parties were the only major choices that people supported. Arguments about how the Cultural Revolution would not have happened if the Nationalists were in power generally ignore the fact that the entire populace was sick and tired of \"the old ways.\"\n\nIt behooves us to remember that Marxism is a Western ideology. And in doing so, we must consider that if either party of China were to accomplish its ideological goals, the cultural artifacts of the old China would stand in the way.

        "text": "@Tom-q9x2v This is made especially interesting given that China was a very strong study of German ideas. Out of all the foreigners, it was pretty much the Germans that were the most helpful and this was most apparent by the fact that both the Communist and Nationalist officers both used German pistols in the civil war. So if we ever get lost in interpreting German thought through the 1900s up to WW2, we have a pretty strong window via Chinese westernization thought. You even have one of the more interesting German figures in China - John Rabe, who is actually celebrated as the \"Good Nazi of Nanking,\" for having saved somewhere around 300,000 Nanjing civilians from almost certain death. It's a great way to at least break away from the heavy propaganda that today's Nazis want to deliver and get glimpses at what reality was like.\n\nIn fact, contrasting this with the fact that Shanghai was one of the only cities in the world accepting Jewish refugees makes for a very interesting result - German thought did not pass down antisemitism up until the Nazis, which is roughly when German-Chinese cooperation halted. This speaks strongly to the efforts of Nazis to delegitimize Marxism as a western ideology and to legitimize antisemitism as a western imperative.\n\nYou can also jump across the ocean and look at antisemitism in Japan to see the narrative shift once Nazis came into power. Because really, both China and Japan should be neutral to the Jewish people as neither have a significant stake in the Abrahamic faiths. And yet what we see today is _quite striking,_ what with there being antisemites in Japan but none of that in China, even though China's closest ally is Pakistan, a very strongly Muslim state.",

The sake of the hierarchy is for the benefit of society.

Most leftists dont actually read marx or hess for example. just like most right wingers dont read rothbard, hoppe or evola. \n\nas for the hierarchy, yea, it's not just capitalism, but even then the justification is the same. for example in feudalism and serfdom, the justification is divine. The king is carrying out God's will which is the best for society, and the lords carry out the king's will. The justification backing king's was the divine right of the ruler. It's why there wasn't expressly athiest kings. capitalisms hierarchy is materialist. Rather than God deciding the best, the market or evolution does. Fascism is spiritual. There is a true spirit the country must embody. National socialism, is about the \"true will of the race\" All if it justifies the hierarchy as the best order to advance society.

The idea that there is a prevailing cultural narrative which happens to be directly in conflict with your own worldview is a convenient farce born out of sheer myopia and confirmation bias (It's also an obvious dogwhistle). There are people with ideas and reasons for having those ideas. A lot of people with capital share similar ideas, which usually tend to land between the center and the far right. I would argue that if I were to pin down a definitive \"cultural narrative\", it would land a lot closer to Stephan Molyneux than you would probably want to admit. Reactionaries tend to see the world through the lens of their own persecution complex, and as such construct a narrative to suit their belief that they're deviant somehow.",

It sounds like they don't have enough medical providers, just like medically under-served areas all over the west. Can you point to a specific policy that causes these supposed long wait times?

Either nobody takes on the entrepreneurial risk, or every single worker has to bear a part of this risk in order to have a job at all. The socialists don't seem to care that not everyone wants that.

A communalization of property is not necessary and under duress is detrimental to any democratic endeavor. Nevertheless, entrepreneurs are exposed to competition.

Both mean differences between people such as bone structure, face shape and skin color that is inherited. Not naming these differences just in humans, means not naming things out of fear. Neither the breeding aspect nor the insufficient genetic difference are valid counter arguments. Which doesn't mean that people of different races are worth different amounts. And that's actually where the fear of this designation breaks.\n \n\n\"Do you believe that various forms of prejudice combined might lead to someone facing more or less unique kinds of discrimination (example: black nem have the prejudice of being criminals and violent. with blank women or white men these prejudices are less common)\"\n\nIt can lead to this, but it doesn't have to.\nIt depends on whether there are prejudices from which the person's characteristics are inferred, or whether there are stereotypes that assign existing facts to corresponding groups of people. And so it is based on the individual who consciously has generalized prejudices, refuses to recognize factual patterns, or recognizes patterns without completely generalising.\nSo yes and no. Above all, it also depends on the definition of racism. The universal definition, or the intersectional transfiguration of racism.\nI find the underlying premise difficult to pin down, especially based on the chosen example.

Wondering what everyone was so upset about. Only hearing a vocal minority screeching about insane topics. Doing what I thought was right by being edgy and challenging all the \"sjw\" types. Until I realized that those folks aren't the problem. The problem was people like me. Focusing on some kooks in college just trying to figure themselves out instead of looking at the bigger picture.

        "text": "@dirtbag1713 You nailed it. For me it was a moment talking to a friend about being “outraged” about some thing being “cancelled” and she said “you know I just don’t care, I haven’t celebrated that stuff in years”. To me that was an aha moment. I too hadn’t celebrates that day in like 12 years and yet I was so triggered about people wanting to make adjustments. Why the fuck am I getting so worked up about people seeing something as bad when it literally has 0 impact on my life?  They could ban the entire thing and nothing in my life would\nchange. Then it fully clicked when Sir Hamilton went on the BLM tour in F1. So many people were triggered and thought it was ridiculous that he “ruined the sport with politics”. And it just seemed so absurd to me, like wtf is the big deal? He wears a t shirt and kneels during the pre-race, omg how terrible, I normally don’t even watch that part of the race but omg that is so intruding, he literally forced me to look at a guy wearing a blm tshirt kneeling for 1 minute can you fucking believe it omg. \nHe is just giving peaceful respectful attention to victims of police brutality for 1 min, like it couldn’t be less intrusive or controversial. And yet people act as if the world is ending. If you are so heartless that you don’t care about innocent people getting killed by the cops why are you getting so upset? Then you should just do whatever you would be doing normally during that part of the pre-race, jerking off or reading youtube comments, not huff and puff and cry. \nIt is such a weird thing to get upset about because it has literally 0 impact on your life, is done respectfully and might actually help people. \nLike what are they so afraid off? People will listen to BLM and now the cops are trained better and have to follow better protocols? How is that hurting anybody? And if you aren’t a cop why do you give a single fuck? It literally has nothing to do with you. \nFor me it was because I had this idea that racism can’t be as bad as they say because in my personal experience it didn’t exist. So when people then point it out I saw it as an overreaction, they are creating racism and trouble by hunting for phantoms. But I realized that no it could very easily be as bad as they say, I live in Europe, nazi tanks were literally rolling by my house 80 years ago and plenty of people greeted them as liberators (after, for no reason and unprovoked, bombing the shit out of us killing tens of thousands). To think that culture magically vanished on May 1945 is so childish. Some of those people greeting the nazi tanks with hitler salutes might even be alive, their children most likely are. The nazi ideology might be gone but the precursors for it still remain deeply buried in our culture.",

You may disagree, but this is where he is coming from. I also would be careful with turning a blind to the political spectrum around the centre as it holds the most power and is currently being transformed by technological opportunity and pressure to advance in face of asian style systems (meanwhile american liberalism is on the decline). I dont see an extrem right nor left take over germany any time soon. However dangerous developments which may pose a threat to liberalism are already being implemented through the centre of politics. May it be thoughts about tracking systems or censorship systems on the internet. These sytems don't need to be bad and in fact are being argued for with very good reasons. The grander issues is what possibilty of abuse and deflation of systems they will cause. There might be fringe people who are waving Kaiserreichs flags (because they cant wave 3rd Reich flags) believing in their superority while looking like hooligans and being badly educated having failed in life ... but who takes them seriously? Too many and for this purpose there is this channel. However i also dont think that they are the main threat. Even tho they might be the worst threat.",

        "text": "Nathan Bear, even if we accept that humans were sufficiently isolated for long enough for (I assume personality) traits to diverge between populations, there isn't much evidence that there would be an evolutionary advantage for any particular traits.\n\nThink of it this way: Lactase persistence is highly advantageous for people with access to milk producing livestock, because it allows for easier nutrition. It evolved sometime in the past several thousand years, and it spread rapidly because of the advantage it gave. Skin and eye pigmentation has differing advantages depending on exposure to sunlight, and we see how that has resulted in different skin colors for modern humans. \n\nThere is however, no proof that certain personality traits or distributions of personality traits would give different advantages for populations in different areas. e.g. There's no reason to believe that humans in East Asia are better off with lower or higher neuroticism than humans in South America, or that humans in Europe should have any difference in openness from those in North America. So why would the populations evolve differently if they're all under the same pressures?\n\nBasically in order for populations to have different rates of expression for traits, there needs to be some sort of reason. Birds might get a tougher beak to crack certain nuts, or they might learn to swim to get at fish that would otherwise be unattainable. Humans would need a reason to express differences in traits that map on to political temperament.",

Both grouos would be sufficiently primitive with regard to us technologically that we could call it fairly even. But think about the challenges they would have to face. If you have fast moving but not densely populated food sources a la the Australian outback, you would select for traits in line with what the Aboriginals express, such as low attention spans, fast running, excellent spatial awareness etc. The opposite is also true though, if you have access to lands which can be farmed, with animals readily accessible for domestication and such, it would be a huge evolutionary advantage for the female Scandinavians to be selecting men for raw strength, disposition to gratification delay, relative monogamy etc\n\nThe rates of these traits being selected for don't have to be high to begin with, there's enough generations for it to add up. My solution to this is to sit down and get a good image of the evolutionary history of as many distinct groups as possible and craft political systems to suit it.\n\nThere is a chunk of the white population which national socialism will work for, and a huge chunk that it won't, so for us all to be successful, we would need multiple systems. The blacks don't want to be oppressed by the Whites, the Whites don't want to be oppressed by the Jews, we need our own spaces and systems.",

They're the originators of critical theory but you'd need to make multiple jumps across dozens of philosophers who all disagree with one another to reach intersectional feminism.\n\nWho the right are actually criticizing are people like Catherine MacKinnon and bell hooks who are both thinkers who go as far to the left as possible. Their ideas have been around academia for decades but they weren't taken seriously outside of first-year college English programs. Their views didn't go mainstream until various Tumblr users weaponized those views.

Bill C-16 in Canada is a good example or the New York law on pro-nouns or the just dozens of examples of where in Germany people have been arrest for what would normally be considered Tweets well within the realm of Free Speech. \n\nYou disappoint me, you seem to be as  dishonest as I have caught some of those people to be.",

        "text": "Three Arrows so we are in the right and left binary now. Ok so take all of the people and outlets you might call “right”. Are they trying to shut down people on the left from speaking? I have yet to see an example of this. Are they refusing to have people from the left on their shows or in debate? Not that I have noticed. Are they pushing for laws to limit speech and debate? Again I’m not seeing it unless, you would consider Islam to be right wing conservatism which technically it is but not when represented in the West Muslims are usually voting left for other reasons. So with all of this being said, regardless of who has the better ideas, it is unquestionable true that the left are preventing debate even using laws to silence it. If you want to stop people flocking to the right, you might want to look at who and how they are being pushed away rather than what you believe is drawing them. The danger at the moment very clearly resides within the left and the alt right. Those people now flocking to the centre right so far as I can see are the only ones remaining reasonable and allowing a discourse. Further, if you label those people far right or alt right, what you do is send everyone into that category who does not belong there and you become responsible for creating the strength of a far right which otherwise would be entirely powerless. Sargon isn’t even close to far right, most of his opinions till recently would belong on the left. The same with Dave Rubin any many others who no longer have a home on the left. It isn’t because they were attracted by fantastical far right con men. It’s due to the despicable behaviour on the left and a cultural Marxism, oppressor narrative, infesting the left",

They are not merely turned away from more important music, but they are confirmed in their neurotic stupidity, quite irrespective of how their musical capacities are related to the specific musical culture of earlier social phases. The assent to hit songs and debased cultural goods belongs to the same complex of symptoms as do those faces of which no longer knows whether the film has alienated them from reality or reality has alienated them from the film, as they wrench open a great formless mouth with shining teeth in a voracious smile, while the tired eyes are wretched and lost above.

Bernstein, New York, 2001, pages 46 to 47.\n\nSo yeah, so much for the cultural Marxists that will destroy Western values with pop music. I wish these dumb conservative YT propagandists will actually fucking read the books and authors that they reference and blame for the \"destruction\" of what they dearly hold on to. And not only the YT propagandists, but the whole Right-Wing propagandists. I actually want everybody to read what they reference, so they do not misrepresent and spread such bullshit all around. But well, that is just my authoritarian and Marxist point of view. :)\n\nGreat job, dude! I love this channel!",

Honestly i don`t think any other position than nihilism is logically coherent, mainly because of regress ad infinitum (basically skepticism applied to values). Are subjective values inherently self-delusional? I`d argue not, since i am aware that there is no transcendent grounding for them. You can see it similar to Kantian postulates, but applied to existential questions (and, in my case, both the question of objective morality and our access to definitive truths of any kind): I am aware that i cannot prove this, but i still act as if it was true, knowing that it, objectively, is not. \nNot that it matters if i deceive myself, since objective morality doesn`t exist anyway. \n\nIn case you are interested in what postulates i have set for myself:\n\nHuman flourishing/well-being is positive.\nLogic is true.\nThe world and myself, and other beings exist (roughly) as i empirically perceive it.\nTime exists.\n\nAnd probably a few more that i haven`t explicitly formulated/noticed yet. Within those assumptions i have come to the conclusion that a certain type of communism is the best political system. \n\n\n@chrusto I never said that though. I am not a Hegelian (but Marxists, in my understanding, generally aren`t since among other things they are materialists, its just that marx was influenced by hegel and was a Left Wing Hegelian for a while), not an existentialist (i don`t believe in free will) and not a postmodernist (although strongly influenced by them). I am a Postmarxist, meaning that there are aspects of Marxist philosophy that i see as wrong and some that i see as correct. And i am a nihilist, rejecting objective values. If i had to name a philosopher that influenced my worldview most, its probably David Hume.\n\nYour assertion that you cannot be Hegelian and nihilistic at the same time is correct though, but the same is true for being Hegelian and existentialist, and in my understanding being a Hegelian postmodernist requires serious mental gymnastics (i am aware of the irony in this statement).  \nCan somebody enlighten me if you can be a nihilistic existentialist though?

Im a hegelian in the same way stirner was: i use hegelian dialectics and agree with most of his philosophical positions, but strongly disagree with his conclusions. (For example, i am idealist only in its weakest, kantian definition, and materialist for all practical purposes)\n\n\n\nIts true that existentialism and \"orthodox\" hegelianism are contradictory, but i am a hegelian in the same way that satre himself and also heidegger were hegelians (id advise you to read satres dialectical reason and heideggers lectures on hegel if you are interested)\n\n\nIm also technically absurdist and not existentialist, so i dont believe in free will full stop, but the distinction between camus and satre was more personal than philosophical imo",

I can't and won't give a definitive judgement upon the moral beliefs of Adorno, Horkheimer or Habermaß since I'm only really starting out my journey into their teachings. But when I view the world through the lense of critical theory there is only one moral belief that could be interpreted as \"\"\"communist\"\"\": That the superiority of the wealthy is not inherently good, but must justify itself through its contribution to the common good.\n\nAnd to be honest I don't think that position is either radical nor unreasonable.",

        "text": "Don't you think Adorno/horkheimer are a bit condencending towards the people exploited under capital? \n\nIn my opinion, the classical marxist conflict worldview is much more rooted in reality than the idea that conflicts of interest are passible to resolution, as Habermas/Rawls want. I cannot see where on earth a \"Kantian Republicanism\" can ever be a reality when all you have is i-rationality and non-discoursive political fights... Eliminating conflict is a highway ticket to fascism, as we have seen (the great party of the centre is a dangerous dream). Not to mention rational agreements can only be possible inside institutions, never between real popular upheavels and the State (legal products need institutional routes such as syndicalism for instance). Even think about the liquid modernity presented by Zygmunt Bauman and the impossibility of discoursive agreements between closed communities (Lyotard) in today's digital framework and social medias. Without conflict, democracies are doomed to fail or give up to the populist agenda, not to mention the fascists.",

They have very little at all in common and have always existed in opposition to eachother. Saying 'Postmodern Marsixm' is sort of like saying 'Right-wing leftism'. Ironically, the only people capable of concocting such a ridiculously contrived idea would be Postmodernists themselves, who sometimes like to entertain contradictory positions in order to 'deconstruct metanarratives'. Despite ostensibly slating Postmodernism every chance he gets, Jordan Peterson  sounds an awful lot like a Postmodernist at times.",

Also consider placing this later in your post because I'm certain you alienated almost all of your readers. \n\"the left basicly calls everything \"Far right nazi\"\"\nThe attention grabbing nature of media now practically enforces hyperbole. It's what people click on very few give attention to \"Modest opinion and detailed explanation of circumstance\" vs \"Extraordinary other claims YOU are a big problem\". So the crazies get loud. It doesn't help matters that if you go to practically any of the comments section for these people they have both mocking and condescending attitudes to plenty of things nazi's would be strongly opposed even if it'd be extreme to say anyone holding those beliefs is a nazi. Looking at things from the perspective of quantity of attention is not a good way to build an accurate image of general opinion within a group. It's as bad as believing (any) media representation of incidents over statistics.\n\nWhat I could see you disagreeing with in a perfectly reasonable way is the labels of far right and far left. They're incredibly relative and give very little information to the reader. The use of the way far gives you a broad range of people potentially accepting your view so the content can appeal to more people. Because most people don't consider themselves extreme so they're not directly offended. Now Three Arrows address specific groups of 'followers' here so it's not that ambiguous. Labels are an effective tool of grouping opinions and avoiding to address them all. Everyone is at fault of doing this. This video doesn't exactly leave you with much respect for the far right as a group even if there's completely orthogonal topics.\nBut it's much to ask of Three Arrows to manage a presentation that responds to a group issue in a way that doesn't leave the viewer thinking of them as a group of opinion or people.

Nobody but the lunatic fringe thinks it is a conspiracy. But there clearly is an alliance of ethnic and social groups who benefit from demonizing white men and dismantling their culture and power.\n\nCultural Marxism isn't a conspiracy. It is just a bunch of movements encouraged by Jews pursuing their interests with all the tools at their disposal.  There are no secret meetings with sneaky Jews hunched over tables in dark rooms planning the revolution...\n\nBut Jews have been 3 % of the US population but up to 30% positions of power. Same in Europe... financial, academic , cultural, artistic. If they calculated that applying pressure to fault lines that already existed.... racial inequality, feminism, mass immigration...  would weaken their powerful white Christian rivals, then of course they would do it. They don't control these movements but they helped get them up and running with financial, academic, media and artistic support.  Who could blame them for pursuing their interests. There is no doubt that living in a Western country now is much better for Jews than it used to be. \n\nSome of these changes have been good, like stopping discrimination against gays and minorities , but the destruction of the family has hurt everyone . Blacks more so than whites.  Three Arrows just ignores this completely.\n\nHe says there is nothing written by the Frankfurt school that can be linked to Cultural Marxism but a simple google search finds Max Horkheimer from the Frankfurt school quoted as saying \"the root of Nazism is the family\"\n\nWilhelm Reich said  \"The organized religious mysticism of Christianity was an element of the authoritarian family that led to Fascism.\"\n\"The patriarchal power in and outside of man was to be dethroned.\"\n\"Revolutionary sexual politics would mean the complete collapse of authoritarian ideology.\"\n\"Birth control was revolutionary ideology.\"\n\nTheodor Adorno's book \"Authoritarian Personality was one of the important books forming the basis of Critical Theory, which was essentially  destructive  criticism  of  the  main  elements  of  Western  culture,  including Christianity,  capitalism,  authority,  the  family,  patriarchy,  hierarchy, morality,  tradition, sexual restraint, loyalty, patriotism, nationalism, heredity, ethnocentrism, convention and conservatism .  The grand scheme of Adorno’s message, along with his other co-conspirators, was to fundamentally rearrange the values of Western nations so that school children and youth would become walking mouthpieces of the Frankfurt school revolutionary characters, thereby bringing about the new man.\"\n\nInteresting that they attack Christian culture and tradition but not Jewish culture and tradition. It seems to be a tool for pursuing Jewish tribal interests by weakening their Christian rivals in every way they can.",

That wasn't even my argument and you know it. \n\nMy response to the actual point starts now. I agree, many third world nations are run but horribly oppressive regimes and have terrible wealth inequality problems. But if you want to actually look at the problem and not just take it for face value, where did these problems come from? One explanation is, and I'm assuming we are largely talking about Africa here, these problems came from colonialism from all sides and a colonialism that is still pervasive and even still happening today as with China in East Africa. The continued interference in these countries from places such as China, the US and Europe is constantly putting greed over the benefit of the people. Global powerhouses fund a regime that is friendly towards their economic interests in that country, and when their economic interests are no longer profitable, they leave and that country ends up with the leftovers. \n\nThose leftovers being some of the problems you identified. Inequality, oppression, dictatorships and similar things of the like. Instead of just going fully grand mal and calling these countries 'shitholes' and identifying issues without identifying a cause raises serious questions about how you value human life.",

There are a few countries that were really messed up by colonialism, India and Native American cultures would come to mind. These had actual cultures that would have been worth preserving and mostly got destroyed by colonialism, yes. However, many countries in Africa were in a terrible state before colonialism and international slave trade even started. Colonialism didn't change very much in many African countries, only who was in charge of the atrocities. Colonialism was nothing to be proud of, certainly, but it wasn't much worse than the circumstances before it and improved a lot of things by sharing modern technology. Furthermore, few European countries actively participated in colonialism, it was mostly Britain, Spain, Portugal and France, to some degree Prussia, the Netherlands, the US and some others. You could make an argument for the affected countries and which countries the colonised, but not for countries that never had a colony in Africa or Asia to begin with. Claiming Europe or the US have to own up for this is the wrong approach, if you really wanted to dig into the history of these things, most of which is around 100 years back already. Even then, it was not a democratically elected decision and now the general population should own up for the decisions of nobility and the few.\n\nSorry, but many of these countries can't be described in any other way, by modern standards. Take a look at how things are going there, even after colonialism is mostly over and done with. There's still genocides going on, persecution and all of those abhorrent things, many of which Europe had very little to do with. They have to fix their own countries, that is the only solution. Taking in millions of immigrants doesn't solve anything, the situation in these countries is still exactly the same, probably even worse because competent people are leaving the country. Saying Europe should take responsibility for this is like saying the French revolution shouldn't have happened and they should have all looked for some other place to live in instead.",

You admit that colonialism was an atrocity but refuse to accept the damage that it did to them is as a fact, greater than how those societies were before colonialism. I'm not going to claim to be an expert on pre-colonial America or Africa but I can sure as hell say that the suffering that colonialism did to those people was far greater than the suffering they may have brought upon themselves. The economic issues in post colonial nations is and still is squarely on the colonizing powers. If you don't believe me, that's perfectly understandable and I respect skepticism but, please, do your own research on the colonial rape of Africa, America, India, Southeast Asia and anywhere else colonialism had its horrible influence on. I take it you're a 'the ends justify the means' kind of person. I agree with you that the situation in many African nations is despotic and tyrannical, but they are despotic and tyrannical because of the rape that the colonizing powers did. These countries are lacking in resources and heavily influenced by whatever power was there. \n\nI think an amazing example of this would be the Belgian Congo, raped the region, killed the population and bled it dry and now its a nation of violence and warlords.",

Partly because they are slavic, partly brecause they are orthodox and partly because of their geographical location(both europe and asia). And that is also why other europeans didnt view russia as western. And often russia defined itself as by opposition to the west. if i am not mistaken Dostojevskij expressed many anti-western ideas.\nThere were people who wanted to make Russia western, Peter the great and Lenin are the most known, of course on two different models. As far as I can tell, they failed.\nIts true Poland views itself as western, although they are slavic, they are located next to Germany and they are catholic, and that is why they view themselves as western.",

What does the west and east divide that makes it still reasonable to keep this categorisation? Is west defined by liberal democarcy? Well how does marxism and nazism fit into this picture of the west of today? Ok, but what is west and east? A sphere of closer related development in culture in contrast to other parts of the world maybe? Well how about we just call \"west\" european then? Ah i don't think west/ east makes any sense outside of warsaw/ nato opposition. You may argue that there are still cold war structures in place and therefore west/ east still makes sense, but it is losing its meaning steadily. When will it cease to make any sense? Also well marxism/ nazism obviously predated cold war alliances so ... yeah it doesnt makes any sense to me at least to talk about west/ east outside of a certain predefined frame, which may indicate that they arent very good terms to begin with. However west/ east narratives might rise in importance again as a new cold war may be coming between US and China. This makes the quality of west/ east clear: its about alliance, ideological frame work, pragmatic identity to unify against a common competitor. West/ east shouldnt be overvalued. It doesnt means that much at all.",

Anti-theistic would probably have been more fitting. Its like you just said to a white atheist who also dislikes colonialism that he is selfhating.\n2. While Marxism has roots in philosophers like Hegel and Feuerbach it is confused to call e.g. hegel the root of marxism for developing the dialectic which marx adopted. Hegel and Marx were SO different. \n3.

All of these questions go back as far as Plato and Aristotle.

The word Axiom goes back to ancient Greece so it's more than evident this it wasn't created by post-modernism. \n\nWhat the post-modernists did was assert that there is essentially no validity to the established axioms of previous philosophical eras, no more validity than those of other cultures in particular, as the post-modernists would focus on the fact that there are ingrained cultural norms, some of which are arbitrary, as evidence that the limits on our knowledge necessitate that everything we define as self-evident is more or less arbitrary, particularly when it comes to what many call \"social constructs\".",

    "text": "I recently found you, because YouTube's algoritm has correctly identified me as the Marxist I am. I am a german political scientist that actually studied within the Frankfurt School. I really liked your Video, but there are a few points where I would want to correct you.\nFirst, Jürgen Habermas is a direct student of Adorno, but they got beef because they had a hugely different few about the 68' movement. Habermas is kinda considered of a dumped down version and more of his own off-branch school.\nSecond, your statement about the DKP (Deutsche Kommunistische Partei, German Communist Party) and the Marxistisch Leninistische Partei Deutschlands (Marxist-Leninist Party of Germany) is kinda.. wrong. They themself are pretty small, that's true. But the KPD (Kommunistische Partei Deutschlands, Communist Party of Germany) which is kind of their spiritual successor was part of the first two Bundestage (Parliament of Post-War Germany). The SPD (Sozialdemokratische Partei Deutschlands, Social Democratic Party of Germany), which is one of our two big Parties in this Country has it's roots in a center left Marxist Movement as well. But those would not be counted today, they're really just considered center-center right now. More importantly, the Party I'm a member of is just called Die Linke \"The Left\" which is self-identified as \"Democratic Soclaists\". We're Marxists, some of us more then others. And we have 10% of the popular vote in this Country. Even the Green Party stil has a few self-proclaimed Marxists or Ex-Marxists.\n\nOtherwise a pretty good video! Thanks, Subsribed :o",

Even people who are well versed in art and cultural academia have hard time defining what exactly post modernist means. \n\nI view it is a critique of “modernism” - which is itself a philosophy about breaking from the past and finding new forms of expression. So for one thing, conflating the modern with the traditional is tautology, modernism is about rejecting tradition at its core. So when JP derides the post modernists as being “opposed to tradition”, and defending traditionalism as modern, he’s literally either confused or just full of shit. \n\nNtm post modernists like Derrida, Dadaists and Marcel Duchamp had a key common point - the art and cultural establishments need to stop taking themselves seriously. And when you respond to a critique like that by saying that by being told to take yourself so seriously, that you are literally “endangering western society”, and that art and cultural establishments are therefore the guardians of our whole civilisation, you’re just proving their point.",

I'll do it for the right side of politics. Here. Nazis were known to have critisised modern capitalism. Indeed, leftists such as FDR said positive things about fascists such as Mussolini in the early 30s. Also given Milton Friedman, Von Hayak, Greenspan, Bernanke were all Jewish, we interpret any criticism of modern capitalism as anti-semetic. Many anti-capitalists or anti-globalists are anti-semetic. look at the left and how many times people on the left like Rev Farrakhan and Al Sharpton and Jessie Jackson blame everything on the jews. The British ALP have had to have numerous  inquiries to get rid of anti-Semitism in their ranks recently. In fact the one well known left wing economist Keynes was the one not Jewish economist and the left loved him for it. \n\nThat's kind of the mirror image of your argument from the right. I don't agree with either characterisation.\n\nCan i suggest you check Jonathan Haidt's criticism of Marcuse? Or maybe Chomsky? Or Pinker? They are all of the left and Jewish, so maybe you will be more open to their criticism of the Frankfurt school.",

Also, what was Habbermas criticism of postmodernism? There are lots of marxists that criticize postmodernism too, including the Frankfurt school. However there aren't a lot of postmodernist criticizing Marxism. Who criticized who isn't really important though, but why. What are their arguments? The arguments aren't usually because they are Jewish or French or Soviet or whatever, but for example: \nPostmodernism says there is an infinite interpretation of reality,  but then how many viable interpretations are there?

The risk is already shared, and the decision making isn't, THAT'S what I want to change. I want democracy in the state, and democracy in the workplace.\nAgain, look up the Mondragon corporation, look up the CNT/FAI, and other projects adjacent to what I'm talking about.

He could at least have watched an actual video on it (reading a book describing it is obviously far beyond the capabilities demonstrated).

It has found its way into both corporate board rooms and public schools—DEI is an indoctrination tool used by this crowd as is the sexual instruction of children at a far too young an age with the purpose of destroying the family.

When the opponents of systemic racism ask \"show me where it is written down\" then the argument goes that it doesn't matter what is de jure, but what are the actual effects. \nWhen people say USA is the greatest and most free, proof: Declaration of Independence says every man is equal - you would say it doesn't matter what it says. \nWhen Christians say religion is good, proof: Ten commandments - you would say it doesn't matter what they claim. \nWhen people say women have equal rights, proof: Every law written - you would say it doesn't matter what is written. \nYet now your thesis on how Cultural Marxism is fake comes down to - there is no written proof.

To lay it out like this the main idea of Gramsci was that the reason the proletariat were not rising up like Marx predicted was because of the culture and it's various institution were keeping them servile. For Gramsci his solution for this was for socialists and other revolutionaries to infiltrate and subvert as many cultural and societal institutions as possible and to hollow them out. The goal of which was to cause enough agitation among the lower classes to make a communist uprising possible. Post-modernism in this case is simply a means to an end for the Marxist, a tool used to subvert out institutions and then to discard it when they take power.",
