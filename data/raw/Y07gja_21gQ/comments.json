    "text": "This stuff needs to stop. What’s so wrong with just teaching your own child to be a good person in general?  There’s no reason for parents, because that’s who should be doing this kind of teaching in the first place, to single out certain people (gays, trans, etc) and start teaching them that a “boy can be a girl” and vise versa. That just confuses them.  Just teach your kids how to be a good person to everyone regardless & teach your kid how to have their own sense of self and good self esteem so they won’t project bad self esteem onto other people and won’t have to rely on the rest of society to build it up and for their own sense of self. This is a huge problem in this country.  Nobody has any sense of self accountability. Everything is someone else’s fault.  This especially rings true with the LGBTQ community but more in the TQ community. It’s not society’s responsibility to call you by your preferred pronoun so you have a good sense of self. The only reason why people get triggered in the first place is because of how they view themselves first and foremost. If someone that is trans is comfortable in who they are as a trans person, they wouldn’t have to rely on someone else calling them a specific name or label to make them feel better. For example, if someone calls you a slut and you get offended, you yourself believe it to be true, even if you tell yourself the opposite, there’s a part of you that believes it.  If someone called me a man, it wouldn’t phase me and I probably wouldn’t even notice.  Why? Because I’m comfortable in who I am and I don’t rely on someone else for my own self esteem and sense of self.  I do recognize that we are social beings, however, this is where balance comes into play and self awareness.",

        "text": "90% of kids with gender confusion grow out of it, I never said they do hormone therapy at 5, but if you're diagnosing at 5, they can start puberty blockers as early as 10, that's a physical transition with long term consequences. Adults can do whatever they want, not my business. Borderline adults like 16 & up is a conversation worth having. But preventing young children from going into puberty is child abuse, plain & simple.",

        "text": "The important details you're leaving out of that 90% figure are:\n1) It's based on studies that looked at ~8-year-old kids who suffered from GD and looked at them again in adulthood. This tells us absolutely nothing about when they desisted, it would be like measuring the height of those kids, re-measuring them when they're 30, finding that by 30 most of them had reached a height over 5-feet, and then saying that 20-year-olds shouldn't be allowed on roller-coasters with height limits of 5 feet. In fact it has been demonstrated that the crucial age for desistance is the onset of puberty, or ages 10-13 (Steensma, Biemond, et al, 2011), which precedes any medical transitioning any doctor would recommend.\n2) Even though the desistance rates are high from prepubescence, that doesn't mean that we can look at even a prepubescent trans kid and predict with good accuracy whether or not they will desist. The severity of the GD symptoms has been shown to be a good predictor of persistance into adulthood (Steensma, McGuire, Kreukels, et al, 2013 & Drummond, Bradley, Peterson-Badali, Zucker, 2008), so the desistance rates don't even really matter to what is being talked about.\n\nYes, they can start puberty blockers as early as 10 if they entered the crucial stage of puberty then, and as I already said the stage in their development in which they're recommended puberty blockers is around or after the crucial stage of possible desistance, and even then doctors are unlikely to recommend puberty blockers unless the symptoms of GD are severe enough, which as I said is a good predictor even from prepubescence.",

        "text": "Lasaret no sir, I did read the entire statement. I just cited the part that emphasized my disbelief in your statement. When people have these feelings of \"I'm not a boy\" or \"I'm not a girl\", we need to combat that and reinforce that you have no choice in the matter, you are born one or the other (sans the hermaphrodites). Instead, we as a society have become so worried about reinforcing everyones feelings and making sure they feel accepted. That is what has landed us in the insane situation we are faced with today (not speaking just about gender dysphoria, but the extreme need for false social justices), because we have to cater to everyones whims and ensure that they feel included. In regards to this gentleman's video(s), he is showcasing how this mentality has overrun our school systems. I don't know if you have kids or not, but I do, and when she's in school, I expect them to focus on a school curriculum, i.e. reading, writing, arithmetic, etc. They are not there to be introduced to gender identity, nor are they there to be made to feel like they are less of a person, because they are a boy, vs a girl, or white, vs black. A school's job is to further my childs education, not take on a parental role and try to form my child into their beliefs. I don't care about someone's need to hear particular pronouns. I am a realist, boys are boys and girls are girls. Sure, they can be free to love who they want, believe what they want, and be whomever they desire to be. But, it will be on their own accord, not because some dipshit teacher thinks they can force this bullshit on them.",

        "text": "Angry American, I'm not exactly sure what you're saying, are you saying that gender dysphoric people are being treated somehow \"wrong\"? If so, what alternative would you suggest and what is your evidence for that position?\n\nGender identity is easily something that could be argued to belong in a school curriculum, it is a fairly major aspect of human psychology after all. Who has been made feel like they're less of a person?\n\nEveryone's a realist when it comes to the specific things you're talking about when you say \"boys are boys and girls are girls\". Again, no-one has said that a biological boy can be anything else than a biological boy, as in, no-one has said that anyone can change their chromosomes, start producing eggs if their body was predisposed to produce semen or vice versa, etc. No-one is in disagreement over those facts, what people are in disagreement over is how the words like \"man/woman\" should be used, so pretending that you're a \"realist\" and others are not when it comes to this issue is pretty ridiculous.\n\nIf any teacher has tried to force or push anyone towards a gender identity that the kid didn't already identify with, then of course the teacher is being a horrible person. I am not convinced that it's something that has happened on any significant scale though.",

Just as the story in this video, the teacher taking the boy to the bathroom and dressing him and introducing him as a girl...what reason on earth can you come up with for reasoning like that? This behavior is the root cause of why our college campuses are now seriously overrun with all of these social justice warriors who are fighting for bullshit causes. Because we have catered to everyone's cries of injustice. I understand you're on the opposite side of the spectrum from me, so our views are totally different. At the end of the day, what I'm saying is, teach my kids the basic curriculum that has worked for decades, leave all that other bullshit alone. Don't speak to my kids about their identity, sexual preferences, political views, nor force your views upon my child.",

However, my child IS my business, and I don't believe gender identity should be discussed as a school topic. I repsect everyone's opinions when it concerns their life. But I don't agree with their beliefs and do not support some outside entity (meaning the schools as opposed to my wife or I) discussing this topic with my child. My beliefs may be wrong, who's to say? But at the end of the day, it's my child, and I (and/or my wife) get to decide which, if any, of these (what I consider to be bullshit) ideologies we expose her to. I feel the same way when teachers want to push the white privilege narative, or the theory that \"America is racist\". That is not what your job is, your job is to ensure my child learns the tools necessary to progress to the next grade when the time comes. Why this topic would be discussed in an elementary school, period, is far beyond me. When I was in elementary, I didn't care about girls, boys, love, racism. I cared about playing, and recess, so I see no reason to introduce this confusing mentality to them. What this does is offer a segue into that lifestyle. Curiosity is piqued, your mind is still developing, so life in general is confusing as can be, why compound it? Just to make it more popular and widely accepted in the mainstream?! Sorry, but if you have gender identity issues, don't look for someone else to make it seem normal and don't try to push your beliefs on someone else.",

        "text": "Angry American, so when you were laughing \"bahahaha\" at what I said, you weren't even actually reacting to what I was talking about.\n\nWell fantastic, you're entitled to your opinion. I think teaching about things like transgenderism and gender identity is a positive thing even in elementary schools for similar reasons why teaching about things like homosexuality is a positive, because the kids who might be transgender become capable of verbalizing how they feel, and the other students (hopefully) learn what trans people are, and that they are people just like everyone else and that there's no reason to socially ostracize them, which is a pretty big problem for trans people. All of that in addition to, as I've said, gender identity simply being a fairly core part of human psychology, I don't think that's a matter of \"belief\" at all, the problem there might be simply not knowing . what gender identity even means, which could ironically have been helped with a lesson about gender identity in elementary school.",
